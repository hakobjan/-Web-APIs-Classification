"I'm an inhabitant of the Galaxy, sell me on joining the Rebelsistance after TLJ","Prior to TLJ when I won't join the Rebelsistance:

* The Rebelsistance has a somewhat significant army and fleet

* Luke Skywalker, a legendary jedi who defeated the Empire, is still alive

* The Rebelsistance has support from various groups/planets

* The Rebelsistance has connections to power-brokers and arms dealers within the galaxy, allowing them to arm their forces

* 5 Planets have been destroyed and have done nothing to rouse me to action


After TLJ:

* The Rebelsistance military is virtually non-existent. A small city's police force could handily defeat them at this point.

* Luke Skywalker is dead. Regardless of how ""inspiring"" his death was, it doesn't change the fact that the most valuable asset against the First Order did no lasting damage to it and is gone forever.

* Every ally the Rebelsistance had has abandoned them. 

* The Rebelsistance has suddenly grown a moral opposition to purchasing/using weapons in war. Of course, this doesn't really matter since 17% of the Rebelsistance's forces made a point of destroying any relationship they had with the galaxy's arms dealers, going so far as to steal the personal ship of one of their sellers.

* I don't believe in the Force, something that is essentially a myth in the galaxy at this point. Any mumbo-jumbo about Luke dying or being the ""spark that ignites the coals that rekindles the flame that burns the First Order"" falls on deaf ears. I care about facts and results, not children's stories.

Why didn't Yoda help save Master Luminara?,"We know they were both on Kashyyyk when Order 66 was enacted and it seems to me that, while very dangerous, the situation was still somewhat ideal to attempt locating Luminara and escaping with her:

- Yoda had beheaded the Commander (and I believe 2nd in command also) of Green company, meaning the clones would be somewhat disorganized
- The droid army was still very much active and engaged in live fighting with the clones so factions of the military would still be occupied with that
- Luminara was a well renown Jedi Master who could have proved very useful in the fight against the Sith

Ultimately we know she was captured and used as bait to trap and kill other Jedi who had decided to brave the apparent danger and tried to rescue her.

A Thought on Luke's Reason For Hiding On Ahch-To,"Luke didn't just see Ben Solo's future, but also his own, on the night he saw that Ben Solo was lost to the dark side. From that moment forward Luke knew he had two choices, *kill Ben Solo*, or *allow Kylo Ren to destroy everything he lives to protect*.

Luke is in a sort of purgatory on Ahch-To, he knows that if he joins The Resistance in battle he will eventually encounter Kylo, and when he does he will be faced with those two choices, *killing Kylo* (the choice he is disgusted with himself for even have considered for a brief moment), or *facing his own death*, and dying the way Obi-Wan did in his duel with Vader in A New Hope (allowing Kylo to strike him down will further strengthen the dark side's hold on Ben Solo).

Luke sees that living the life of the legendary warrior *Luke Skywalker* means he has to face this decision. So he walks away from his life as *Luke Skywalker*, removing himself from the story that is unfolding across the galaxy, and living the life of a farmer on Ahch-To, the sort of life he once dreamed of escaping on Tatooine before his name became legend. 

It's not until Luke sees a way to meet Kylo in battle, without having to make either of these choices, that he is freed from his *purgatory*, and becomes one with the force having completed his journey.

Thoughts on The Clone Wars: Season 7,"After rewatching the show, I am really excited  for The Clone Wars to be making a surprise return in 2019! However, 2 things that I dont like about it: there will only be 12 new episodes and you can only watch it on Disney's new streaming service. Granted, I will probably just pirate the season cause I am not paying for another service. But 12 episodes seems a bit...light. I think they might give us 12,  one hour episodes in order to make 3-4 episode story arcs into 1 or 2 episodes, so they can have more content in a single episode. That would allow the creators to have more things to work with. Hopefully that is the case, but I am not sure. What do you guys think they will do? ",StarWars,True,1535699986,2018-08-31

"Let’s see, what can we salvage after TLJ that is at all interesting for this final film?","•Snoke is dead, which should leave the first order in disarray. Whoever funds them surely won’t be happy that their org. is in the hands of children. Infighting would be an interesting angle to look at, especially between Hux and Ren.

•Kylo and Rey are both young, impressionable, and only one has any sort of training. Maybe discount the whole sith/Jedi Black and white balance thing for one that is more grey. Maybe even flip flop sides.

•As of right now, the SW universe feels small. The governmental structure of the galaxy was destroyed (I guess) in TFA. Who is running this joint now? Establishing rules on how planets are being ran and the FO’s effect on them would solidify why they are the bad guys and would add stakes to the whole ordeal.

•Here’s maybe stretching for some of us, but still food for thought: what if midiclorians were to fundamentally change? Imagine a scenario where they could no longer harbor the force as we have come to expect. Maybe they lose that all so important balance. What if this change turned force users insane and the whole film was the resistance and FO working together to try and take on a now powerful Rey and Ren?

The Legendary Super Jedi!!!!!,"This is just an idea I had. Just think a Super Saiyan but with a Jedi. The Jedi gets a huge boost in force energy and base force powers (Force push, levitation, ect), gains access to additional force abilities (like maybe flight or something), and is able to pull off feats no normal Jedi even masters could ever hope to accomplish. Maybe pulling a whole planet out of its gravitational pull with the force.

As far as a transformation goes perhaps their lightsaber blade changes to a color that's unique to Super Jedi.

I know it's kind of a dumb idea and that the people behind Star Wars would never do anything like that, but I was just having fun with a dumb idea.

Episode IX will be just as divisive and hated as TLJ regardless of its actual quality,"There are a lot of Episode IX predictions but these are the only ones I'm sure will come true:


- With a runtime of 2-3 hours max, there won't be enough time to deliver on every single pet fantasy every single fan has
 - Fans are so attached to their requirements and expectations that they'll simply refuse to accept any deviation from them
 - Some fans have *vastly* different requirements and expectations for Ep 9, so it's guaranteed that large fractions of the audience will be angrily disappointed regardless
- With a giant pile of !Mystery Boxes! and more on the way, there won't be time to open them all regardless of what's inside them, leading to some dissapointments for everyone
- The ""SJW propaganda,"" real or imagined, will still be there; it's unlikely that Ep 9 will turn on a dime to reject the themes it has presented so far, thus hating Kathleen Kennedy will either continue as-is or intensify
- Fans will interpret or misinterpret scenes to fit their personal narratives
- Fans who make good on their promise to boycott Episode 9 will still engage in criticizing it despite their proclamations that they do not care
 - (Most fans currently promising to boycott Ep 9 probably won't)
- With the trilogy completed, YouTubers will make hours and hours of new videos about why they hated the ST as a whole, recycling a lot of ideas from their TFA and TLJ hate videos.
- Regardless if Ep 9 is better or worse than TLJ, fans will express relief that JJ made it and not Rian Johnson 
- Regardless of Ep 9's quality, fans will ~~speculate~~ believe that the rejected Colin Trevorrow version of Ep 9 would've been better regardless if they can get more info on his script 
- Regardless of Ep 9's quality, Star Wars fans simply will/can not enjoy Episode IX

Star wars audio books for 6 year old?,"Hi all,

Like most kids, my son loves all things Star Wars.  He especially likes listening to Star Wars audio books in the car.  Currently he is listening to the kids ""read along"" versions of the original trilogy, which are heavily abridged and only about 15 minutes long.  I grabbed a copy of the ""Dark Forces: Soldier of the Empire"" audio book from the library and I was blown away!  It had great voice acting and sound effects.  My son was enthralled listening to it.  Unfortunately it hit on a few too many adult themes (genocide, etc) for a six year old so we had to stop listening to the disappointment of the entire family.

So I'm searching for recommendations for another audio book along the same lines.  I like the dramatic ""radio play"" style of storytelling from the Dark Forces book, and the length seemed about perfect (2 hours).  I'm a lot less interested in the long unabridged versions of the novels.  Does anyone have any recommendation for similar books with less violence and adult themes?  It doesn't have to be kids versions of the stories, adult versions are fine, so long as they are appropriate.

"""at least Ackbar didn't die off screen like he did in Legends""","Okay this is just a minor thing but seeing as how I'm reading the book where this happens I felt like talking about it. I feel like it because it is my favorite book in the entire New Jedi Order series and includes one of my favorite Space Battles in all of Star Wars. A battle that is akbar's last great act. 

Destiny's way is all about being a turning point. not for the characters because most of them have already completed their major arcs for the series but for the war itself. And Akbar is front and center in this book. He is treated as this Wise Old Statesman who is sick and dying but wants to Still help save the Republic. He is shown being tired and physically frail and not being able to be out of the water much while still being intelligent and even having the president and the current leader of the galactic Navy offering him their spots.

At the end of the book he comes up with this large multi-layered trap that destroys the enemies ability to wage a offensive War. Sadly he does technically die off screen but he dies at the end of the battle so it's sort of a somber moment doing this great Victory where is the heroes realize that they have lost this great Statesman who was the one who gave them this victory.

now let's compare that to the ackbar we see in The Last Jedi. Instead of getting multiple scenes with the main characters and having one of the minor plots revolve around him he is in the background of two or three scenes. His death is also treated as just a minor footnote it happens in the background and he just gets lumped in with everybody else that died during the attack.

so yeah he did die off screen of peaceful old age in a book where he is Central to the plot of defeating the enemy. and yes books have more time than movies to develop characters and plot and blah blah blah but the book with all of its Pages didn't have to include Ackbar.",StarWars,True,1535750582,2018-08-31

I have great memories specifically of the musical score that was released alongside the novel. And I never owned an N64 but still managed to play the shit out of that game at a friend's house.

Anyhow, I think there is a lot of potential in SotE, so many iconic characters and world building.

Rewatched TFA and TLJ again and...,"...TLJ makes literally no sense when you take what was presented to the viewer in TFA into account. That was the only reason why I disliked TLJ. It wasn't an awful movie as some people make it out to be and visually it was absolutely stunning, having some really great scenes but I am not a fan of the overall story arc. 

In TFA, it is made crystal clear that Rey is SOMEBODY.  ""Classified, really? Me too, big secret."". ""Who is the girl?"". I could go on. It is hinted at all through the movie. Then we have Kylo who admires Snoke and considers him very wise. In TLJ, he kills the guy after being called a child. 

I am just wondering whether Rian even watched TFA before writing the script for TLJ. I mean I am sure he did multiple times but I just can't get my head around why he made the choices he did. 

I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and I was always really positive when it came to the Disney takeover and all canon material that came with it. I LOVED TFA and was amazed/in awe when walking out of the cinema after seeing it for the time. Same goes for Rogue One. I liked Solo too. But TLJ... I really, really wanted to like this movie and told myself many times that I just need to think more about it and I'll learn to appreciate it but not finally I am ready to admit that I dislike its narrative.

So just in case anyone is not aware, I am the author of a project called ''Star Wars Alternate'' it's a Fanwork project published by Edge of L.A Productions and it is basically Star Wars albeit written by me. Although several issues have already been published since 2016 they are not public and the project itself is still a WIP.

Anyway, as part the SWA canon the Jedi younglings Petro, Katooni, Zatt, Byph, Ganodi, Gungi do survive the Jedi Purge and i'm still working on there aged up versions.

I found a model known as Laurence Coke who to me, looks like he could be an older Petro.

This is an image comparing the two, what are your opinions ?

Where were the jedi masters?,"SPOILER WARNING - MENTIONS NEW MOVIES

So I've seen all of the new Disney Star Wars films, and despite all of the great and horrible missteps that they've made, one thing is really ticking me off. Where were all the jedi masters when Luke's New Jedi Order was massacred by Ben Solo/Kylo Ren? Ben attacked because he though Luke was going to kill him, and somehow destroyed the entire temple? We know that after Order 66, roughly 2% or 200 of the Jedi survived. Of these 200, about 100-140 were hunted down and killed by Vader and the Inquisitors or were turned to the dark side. So that leaves roughly 60 Jedi, if the stat I saw was correct. Now not all of these Jedi would join the new order, as some were opposed or self-eciled themselves. But at least some had to return, right? At least a dozen, if not more, of the Jedi would have rejoined to help train the future Jedi. But somehow, some untrained padawan-level Jedi is able to get a few of his friends and just destroy everything? 

And I know that those numbers are from the legends universe which isn't canon ectera ectera. But at the very least, what about the Jedi who Luke was training before Kylo/Ben? Kylo/Ben destroyed the New Order somewhere between 28 and 34 ABY. If the second Death Star was blown up in 4 ABY, then Luke had roughly 20 years to train other Jedi. Where were these ones? Or are we ment to belive that Kylo/Ben, who was the equivalent of a padawan learner, was able to gather a few of his friends and topple the rest of the Jedi who had been training for at least 20 years? And that each and every one of the New Order Jedi just happened to be at the new temple at the same time so that they could be killed by Kylo/Ben?

"Theory: Rian originally intended for Rey to turn to the Dark Side and join Kylo in TLJ, but he was forced to change it at the last minute.","I think Rey was originally supposed to turn to the Dark Side in The Last Jedi and join Kylo, but Disney or whoever forced Rian to change it at the last minute for whatever reason. Given this, I think it’s very likely Luke originally survived.

Evidence:

 * Rey is extremely prone to violent outbursts despite allegedly following the Light Side. This has been widely attributed to bad writing, but I think I think it’s more likely this was supposed to be a set up for her turn to the Dark Side, especially when Luke tells her she “went straight to the dark”.

 * Rian has a disturbing obsession with Kylo Ren, so I think he would want Rey to join him.

 * The entire subplot where Rey discovers her school shooter fetish and heads to the Supremacy has basically no payoff because Rey doesn’t join Kylo, implying she was originally supposed to.

 * Rey inexplicably makes an escape from the Supremacy off-screen which is only referenced in a throwaway line, and inexplicably makes it to Crait in time to help the Resistance, heavily suggesting she originally never left the Supremacy.

 * [Colin Trevorrow cryptically said that there were ""frantic rewrites"" to include the ""mentor"" in an ""epic fight sequence""] (https://twitter.com/colintrevorrow/status/1001795335331745792?lang=en), implying the ""fight"" scene between Luke and Kylo was added at the last minute and Luke originally didn't die.

Snoke: a jed'aii?,"Before the Jedi knights or Sith came into existence. The force sensitive people were known as the jed'aii. 

(This video is more in depth)[https://youtu.be/zVtYgI8B_18]

They came before the jedi, and, unlike the jedi or sith did not get involved with planetary affairs and instead kept to themselves and focused on meditation on their home planet. But one thing I noticed is that their teachings are not focused on the dark side, or the light, their goal was to balance both dark and light. 

I could not help to bring this up because the first thing I thought of when hearing that was supreme leader snoke. Supreme leader snoke was obsessed with the balance of dark and light. He didn't only use the dark or only use the light. He used both the dark and the light, balanced. 

Even more so snoke leads the first order. And the jeda'ii were the first order to study the force. 

But one thing I hear you say is ""the jedaii were aincent, if snoke were a jedaii he wouldn't be alive.""

Then I ask you to look at Darth nihlus and Darth sion. Both Sith powerful enough to cheat death. If you use the force enough you can cheat death and keep yourself form dying form at least old age. Not necessarily form other people (ie: kylo killed snoke) but he can at least keep himself fkrm perishing from at least age. This would be why snoke hid himself in the outer religions until the Emporer was killed. Because he knew the Emporer was a threat. He could keep himself form dying form aging but he could stop himself form being killed by another force user. This is why he looks so disfigured, because he is so old and he has used the force to stop himself form death and most decay, but still ceases to look alive.

5. Luke trains to fly in a  T-16 Skyhopper, an in atmosphere aircraft and is able to transition to a space craft without issue or further training.

"So, can somebody give me the lowdown on Blaster Bolt colors?","I’ve noticed throughout the Star Wars Saga that 4 different colors of blaster bolts/ship laser bolts are used:

Red: Rebel blasters, Stormtrooper (Empire and FO) blasters, CIS blasters and Droideka/SBD wrist guns, X-Wings, A-Wings, Rebel Y-Wings, Rebel turbolasers, Vulture Droids, various factions of pirates/smugglers/bounty hunters

Blue: Republic Blasters, Resistance Blasters, Ion charged weapons, when any gun is set to stun it fires blue circles, Republic Y-Wings, Republic turbolasers, various different factions of pirates/smugglers/bounty hunters

Green: TIEs, Imperial turbolasers, Naboo Royal Guard blasters

Yellow: Mandalorian blasters


But I’ve never seen a satisfactory answer as to what they all mean in universe.  Obviously outside of universe the different colors are simply a design choice to make the battles look more colorful and to keep track of who’s who, but in universe it kind of seems like it should have an explanation.

I’ve seen a couple explanations, but none feel quite right:

1. The color is equal to the quality/type of gas used to create the bolt.
This theory posits that red bolts are lower quality gas, blue bolts are ion infused gas meant for taking down electronics/droids, and yellow and green are simply higher-end/more expensive gas

I like this theory, except it exposes a few problems, mostly with the blue gas being ion infused.  Blue bolts are used by both the Republic and the Resistance, along with many pirates and smugglers in TCW, if blue gas was ion infused, it would make sense for Clones to be using it as it would be more effective against droids, but the Resistance and the pirates in TCW would have no reason to use it.  Also, if blue lasers are better at taking down electronics, why wouldn’t all ships have blue lasers, regardless of faction?


2. The colors don’t change anything about the bolt, it’s simply a “tracer” or a way to know who’s firing at who.

This theory has more real world relevance, as real bullets will sometimes be used as “tracers” that leave little marks of color behind as they fly, this allows the shooter to see where he shot and readjust his aim accordingly, as well as to keep track of who is shooting what weapon.  This makes perfect sense in the Star Wars universe, except when it comes to the Rebels and the Empire.  If switching between colors was as simple as flipping a switch, and if it was common practice to use a different color than your enemy, why would the Rebels have kept their blasters at red?  It wouldn’t really make sense...

So, that’s why I’m curious if any of you guys have any theories or ideas as to what the different blaster colors could mean?

What is the most efficient Star Wars fleet?,"So yeah, what do you guys think is the most efficient Star Wars fleet? Keep in mind factors such as limited resources and political factors.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think my ""dream fleet"" would look something like this:

Primary Battlecruiser: Bulwark Mk. 3. The Bulwark has lots of cargo space, high firepower and great shielding, but is fairly expensive but is known for sometimes having complications in electronics and sensors, and I would obviously get that fixed. The Bulwark would be the main frontline ship for my fleet, having good shields and high firepower, plus the cargo space which could be used for fighters and troop transport.

&amp;#x200B;

Carrier: Venator-Class Star Destroyer. The Venator, thanks to its ventral hangar, can deploy fighters in record time. With some modifications to improve its hangar space, the Venator would make a great addition to my fleet.

&amp;#x200B;

Light Corvette: MC60. The MC60 is small, fast, and very durable for its small size, and would, in this case, be modified to have more point-defense cannons. It is also known for its ability to quickly release its load, allowing for clusterbombs, proximity mines or even just random scrap to be released quickly, giving the MC60 extra utility.

&amp;#x200B;

Superiority Figher: HMP Droid Gunship. This gunship is big, decently well-shielded, and has huge firepower, and independently rotating cannons, allowing it to attack multiple enemies at once. This fighter, being very expensive, would be fairly rare, but would act as a great supportive element for the cheaper fighters, especially with its variety of missiles.

&amp;#x200B;

Swarm Fighter: Droid TIE Fighters. The Empire has experimented with droid-controlled TIE fighters, and considering the way TIE fighters are designed to be used, this sounds like a great idea. These TIEs would have a redesigned wing pattern to make them a little smaller, and be more easily crammed together in a ship, and would be released in large groups together, using their droid nature to coordinate group attacks and have great reflexes. These TIEs would be given photon bombs instead of missiles, and would be commonly used for risky mass bombing runs and as a screen against enemy fighters.

&amp;#x200B;

Special Ordinance: Repair Missiles: Special missiles filled with small droids similar to the Buzz Droids from the Clone Wars, but instead of tearing ships apart, they would repair them. These would help extend the lifespan of fighters out in the field, especially the HMPs.

Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith The Videogame

To everyone here on Reddit who likes Dueling and/or PVP/PVE games, and/or also like  Star Wars and the untold lore around Ep. 3. This game is for you! i love  this game personally and have beaten it many times.

it has  superb combat and amazing duels against classic characters as well as  characters not introduced in the movies, as well as fighting against  never before seen droids and clone fighter types. the levels in game  explore famous scenes from the movies while going much deeper into the  plot, narrative and story-telling.

Along with a versus mode where you can plug in a second controller and try to best your friend/enemy in a test of skill and might!

Above is a Unlock-able Alternate  Ending. no need to explain, just watch the video, it show cases the  beautiful combat and story-telling the game has to offer.

i could  go on for days about this game and love it from the bottom of my soul.i  sincerely hope you will love playing it as much as i do.

You will have to get your old PS2 or OG XBOX to play this. And as long as your console works well enough, you'll be able to play this game  buttery-smooth and lag-free. Despite its slightly low level graphics, it  makes up for it in fluid story telling and gameplay and Lore-Expansion. ",StarWars,True,1535868565,2018-09-02

How did Palpatine force-choke Dooku from half a galaxy away?,"In the Clone Wars, when Palpatine became displeased with Count Dooku, he outright force choked him from half a galaxy away.

This is far, far beyond what any other Sith can do. Even Darth Vader could merely force choke someone on the same ship as him, and that was with a regular human.

If Palpatine was so powerful, what was stopping him from randomly getting into holograms with his enemies, then force choking them immediately?",StarWars,True,1535880983,2018-09-02

A New Hope: What were the trench run wingmen supposed to be doing?,"I mean, I understand from a dramatic perspective that having guys picked off one by one adds to the tension, but was there ever a stated reason that three guys had to do the trench run together? Two just seem to sit there and do nothing but get picked off. 

I think one of them says something about ""holding off"" Vader and the two other TIEs, but quite how he was doing that escapes me. Unless they were being human shields, just there to physically block the Imperials from shooting the leader? 

Tactically, wouldn't it have made more sense to have the two wingmen out of the trench and ""higher"" (relative to the Death Star) than the leader, that way they could five down and shoot at the back of any TIE trying to get onto the leader's six? 

Overthinking maybe, but I'm wondering if I missed an in-universe explanation for the tactic? ",StarWars,True,1535887150,2018-09-02

Anyone else love the scenes where Anakin and Obi-Wan duel side by side?,"One of the best things I feel the Clone Wars did for the prequels was vastly improving the lightsaber battles, and, honestly, I feel the dynamic it did with Anakin and Obi-Wan's fighting style was excellent. I feel the Lost Missions episode where the two of them duel Dooku exemplifies their style best, Anakin and Obi-Wan are often described as two halves of a single nearly unstoppable fighter, Anakin is their unrelenting offense and Obi-Wan is their unbreakable defense, sure, a lot of the Jedi fight side by side, but rewatching that aforementioned duel especially you notice that their movements blend into each other, compared to most other duels where the two Jedi just take turns. I feel it did a lot to lend legitimacy to the idea of Anakin and Obi-Wan being two of the most skilled and close Jedi in the order.",StarWars,True,1535888907,2018-09-02
What I want from a Boba Fett movie,"Just my opinion based on liking the character. Not exactly thrilled with his character origins, but not disappointed either. I think that a Boba Fett movie would be awesome if it was done one of two ways.

1: Done like Dredd. It’s Boba Fett on a high value target... Possibly partnered with other Bounty Hunter(s). Post ROTS, pre ANH. Not a ton of locations. More of a showcase of his abilities tracking down a target, delivering, getting paid. Never removes helmet (possibly one shot where Daniel Logan puts on/takes off the helmet. Have Boba Fett played primarily by stuntmen. Not tied to any other films in any critical way. Just a small, self contained day in the life of Boba Fett during a challenging bounty. Violent, pushing the extremes of a PG-13 rating.

2. Post Return of the Jedi. Disoriented Fett escapes Sarlacc pit. Tracks Han back to Cloud city where Imperial holdouts are making one of their last stands. Tons of callbacks. Made about five years from now, uses Solo actors to reprise their roles with the Han and Lando scenes on Cloud City. Ties in heavily to Last Jedi. Boba Fett and Solo end up in a truce. Twist to the Boba Fett story is that we discover that Jango Fett had multiple clones of Boba Fett made, and they’re all active.",StarWars,True,1535889076,2018-09-02
Resistance transport!,"A few months back Disney set up a couple dioramas showcasing the plans for Galaxy's Edge, and one of the fine-detail individual models is a Corellian dropship type thing, called an I-TS (Intersystem Transport Ship). I'm really hyped that we have a good dropship design for the Resistance in Canon, available for EaW mods and stuff.

I know the Resistance already had the 'Resistance transport', but it's not the best ship design, and looks really fragile, like a malnourished B-Wing. The toothless space-buses from TLJ aren't very good either. Yeah, they look like tiny GR-75's, but they're civilian ships that the Resistance somehow managed to get their hands on en masse, and the plain design is hampered by the fact that they're the only transports seen. What happened to the ones from TFA? By Episode 9, we'll probably have new transport for each movie.

The I-TS looks like a U-Wing and a CR-90 had a baby, and that's a good thing. Yeah, the design callbacks to other Rebel ships is a little on the nose, but the design blends them together really well, and it's got a tortoise-like chubbiness that endears you too it while actually having means to defend itself. I really love the design, what do ya'll think?

Why I think The Last Jedi was so divisive and the nature of tragedy in fiction,"Hi /r/StarWars. So without getting into whether or not I personally liked the film, I wanted to offer my perspective on why I think people both rabidly love and intensely hate this movie. To me, it boils down to the nature of tragedy in fiction. I think it’s obvious that there’s nothing inherently wrong with telling a sad story. If you play your cards right, a tragic ending can be thematically resonant and provide catharsis for the viewer or reader. You may feel sad in the short term, but it’s ultimately an uplifting experience. 

But what happens when a writer doesn’t play their cards right? What happens when your story seems to be sadness and cruelty for the sake of sadness and cruelty? Then you are just left with those shitty feelings. You never get your catharsis because apparently there wasn’t any point to the struggles your characters have been through. It has just been sadness for the sake of sadness. 

I want to share a quick story about what gave me this perspective. I’m a big Batman fan and in the current ongoing series, Batman was supposed to be married. In the end, though, his bride-to-be calls off the wedding because she feels as though Bruce can’t be happy *and* be Batman. That left a really bitter taste in my mouth (along with a lot of other fans) because it’s one of Batman’s oldest cliches. Even in The Dark Knight, the most popular depiction of the character in modern times, plays with the idea that his happiness is incompatible with his mission. So when Batman is left at the altar, we’re left feeling sad and angry, but without any interesting reason for doing it. It seems like the writer is being mean to Batman just for the sake of being mean to Batman. 

Which brings us to the character of Luke Skywalker. There is no denying that TLJ turns Luke’s story into a very sad, tragic tale. He is broken and lonely in his old age. So why would a writer do this to such a beloved character? The answer is, to tell a story that is worthy of that sadness. Rian Johnson used that tragedy as thematic fuel for the narrative he was telling. Fans of the film will feel that the quality of the story justifies that kind of tragedy. Detractors of the film will gain no closure from the story, and are therefore just left feeling shitty and sorry for Luke. I think that’s why you see so many people saying the film left them feeling sad and angry after watching it. They never got their resolution, so those feelings just sit there and ferment. 

I’m aware that people have problems with TLJ that go beyond Luke’s treatment. I totally understand that. But if the movie had merely been mediocre in their eyes, people would have disliked it, not hated it as passionately as they do. 

TL;DR - Fans of TLJ feel that making Luke’s story a tragedy was justified by the story, people who hate the film feel that it did not. ",StarWars,True,1535905240,2018-09-02
Pop Culture Detective's TLJ video discussion (spoilers for TLJ),"Hi everyone,
first time posting here, so please correct me if I did something wrong.

Recently Pop Culture Detective released a video on youtube [How The Last Jedi Defies Expectations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWqVJZMh6-w). It's an interesting take on the themes of TLJ, focusing on male-female interactions throughout the movie and I really liked some interpretations of particular scenes. I usually take his analytics of a movie reception with a grain of salt, since in his videos, in my opinion, he often blames the male portion of the audience for failing to get over their masculinity and not embracing the feminine themes. He did so again with TLJ, in this case, however, I was much more exposed to such critique. 

One person I know and often discussed the movie with was making a point about portraying the female portion of characters as strong and the male one as weak, flawed. I should probably note that, unlike me, he didn't enjoy the movie. The youtube video makes a point about it being for the purpose of defying expectations (which the movie does a lot). Although I would disagree if someone called the movie ""feminist propaganda"", the fact is that it contains some strong female characters who often interfere with the plans of male heroes of the story.

Pop Culture Detective makes a point about it being different than most movies in which female characters don't have a real impact on the plot. For him (and me) such a change of including it in a major blockbuster movie marks a positive step toward better representation of women in movies. TLJ opponents often argue that it's forced feminism and diversity and doesn't benefit the movie or even renders it worse.

In my opinion, TLJ was an enjoyable piece of cinema, and watching it I didn't feel overwhelmed with feminist themes. Only after, when I started researching other opinions I stumbled upon this topic. It didn't change my opinion about the movie, although as someone whose opinions align with the movie message, I might be a little biased. Because of this, I wanted to ask for your opinions on the subject, particularly what do you think about PCD arguments, whether women portrayal benefited or harmed the movie and your evaluation of TLJ as a movie.",StarWars,True,1535905402,2018-09-02

Thrawn: Alliances (Spoilers),"I have to say that I loved the book. The Thrawn and Vader dynamic was fantastic as well the Thrawn and Anakin One. Very interesting to see the Chiss and Grysk. 

I have a question for you: do you expect we will see a war between the Chiss and the Grysks potentially even the FO in a book series or mini series? I do expect one of the two to happen since they are really setting up something great in the Unknown Regions. Would love to see Thrawn and Ezra in the mix and why not Ahsoka and Sabine.

I made my peace with Luke Skywalkers death.,"Until recently one of the things I really didn’t like about TLJ was Lukes death. I found it quite pointless and disappointing. I really wanted Luke to beat the **** out of Kylo. Instead, he died from exhaustion or so I thought. 

I changed my mind when someone pointed out to me, that Luke didn’t die from exhaustion. He simply became one with the force and more powerful than any user of the dark side could ever imagine. His death doesn’t mean he‘s gone. He just followed Obi-Wan‘s and Yoda‘s footsteps.

The Nebulon B can’t have hangars and I don’t get why legends and now seemingly canon wants to say they do.,"I’m a big ship fan, and the nebulon B is probably one of the most love hate relationships anyone could have with a ship. My biggest issue though is the insistence the ship has hangars because not only does it not make spacial sense but it turns lando into an asshole. Now I wouldn’t be opposed to it having a modification to add a hangar instead of being a medical frigate or whatnot but by default it makes no sense for it to have one. Not only would it have had to have been big and visible in episode 5 scale wise but if that were the case lando would’ve made a one handed luke climb a ladder instead of just walking out to the medical facility. Now it isn’t entirely too late, and I hope someone from lucasfilm reads this, but since it’s never been seen (Star Wars 4 did show a hangar that seemed like it was from a nebulon but it’s outline didn’t fit, it’s likely a dedicated hangar vessel) and only said to be a carrier in the rebel files (which could mean like the gozanti). But seriously, let’s not be legends and ruin all sense of consistency and scale by not caring, and let’s make the nebulon B be a shining example of such. ",StarWars,True,1535932269,2018-09-02

I'd love to see Episode 9 go in this direction,"I had a feeling with the ending of Last Jedi, galaxy commoners would come to the aid of the resistance, after seeing that little kid use the force on the broom.  The galaxy is inspired by (luke? rey? someone?) to truly vanquish the Order.

&amp;#x200B;

Thats probably whats going to happen considering an entire solar system was wiped out in Awaken, I mean how the fuck would anyone else in the galaxy act like they'll stand for that like they did by submitting to the Empire.  Last Jedi should've shown the galaxies' reaction/plan to deal with this threat.  But everyone in the casino hell, that whole planet, felt contempt and fine with it.  I suppose they were under the Orders good graces because of the weapon fiasco but STILL, I'm fairly certain a good portion if not the whole galaxy witnessed the Order obliterating an ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM yet its like the only people who care at all is the very small and pretty much (at this point) insignificant Rebel...Resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly hope Episode 9 plays out that way, the galaxy joining forces to overthrow their new oppressors. Giving actual weight to the plot.  It pretty much has to go that way considering the entire resistance is reduced to 12 people lol. I mean SERIOUSLY where is everyone, with this new trilogy we've gotten (4..?) new planets and barely anyone lives on them.  This would be a great opportunity to recognize the prequels as well. This last film MUST acknowledge the prequels in someway to tie it all together considering this is it, the ending to star wars (hopefully haha).  Maybe show various species/factions we saw in the prequels joining forces (yes even Gungans...).  Although I have a feeling we'll only be seeing forces we saw in the OT such as Hutt clans and Landos connections to various crime syndicates come to the aid of the Rebels.  Yet if that IS that case I still feel thats very cheap and a cop-out to still avoid anything to do with the prequels because whether you like them (which I do) or not, They are still star wars and will always be a vital part to the overall story we have and they need to not be ignored in Episode 9.

&amp;#x200B;

How the ending of The Last Jedi should have been...,"The Last Jedi was disappointing for a Star Wars movie because it doesn't have the one thing all movies of the saga should have... a lightsaber duel.

If the movie was directed properly, it wouldn't be such a bad movie. The scene on Crait would be different but the end wouldn't change much... 

On Ach-to, Luke would lift his X-wing (just like how Yoda did in TESB), get his green lightsaber and actually go to Crait instead of projecting himself. Kylo and the First  Order's troops would see the X-wing then Kylo would order every gun they have to fire on that ship. All shots would miss, or even hit other AT-M6s because Like would trip one of them with a cord, like what he did in TESB. Kylo, seeing that shooting the ship has no effect, would go down challenging Luke duel him. Luke jumps off his X-wing without landing it (making it crash on an AT-M6), and ignite his saber. While Luke and Kylo are down, Hux is in the ship, he orders an 3 AT-M6s to shoot Luke, Luke reflects 2 shots while stopping 1 with the force (Like what Kylo did in TFA) then he moves to the side and let's go of the laser. The laser would hit the ground. Kylo turns on his saber. The fight will have same dialogue except, they're having a real duel, something worth watching. At the end of the duel, Luke would look at the resistance troopers leaving while Leia is at the end, still watching the fight. The see each other, the camera focuses on Leia, then on Luke. He closes his eyes, then sacrifices himself exactly like how Kenobi did in ANH. He would lift his lightsaber then vanish right before Kylo's saber hits him. On top of his robe we will see not just his lightsaber, but also Han's dice. He was holding it in his other hand the whole time. Kylo picks up the dice, stares at it, then throws it away while shouting. He would get Luke's saber then keep it with him, which would reappear in Episode IX. The events after that would remain the same.

The only difference is that Kylo has Luke's lightsaber at the end and of course, the movie's ratings would've been better.",StarWars,True,1535974296,2018-09-03

Still a lot of questions about Rey,"And alot of crazy ideas for her basically....

-She is the true leader of the First Order, Snoke was simply a ""distraction"". Sure big menacing somewhat random ""Force"" user but you need someone to play there ""part"" well 

-The memories given to her were false and she may not realize it. Somehow she tricked herself into a total memory wipe(including who her parents actually are) to basically not wrath of Republic justice upon her head

-Another possibly is she maybe one of Kylo's rather vague ""Knights of Ren"" and once his most trusted members until some sort of falling out between her and the rest of them. 

She is only useful to Kylo because of what she could do with the force and just wants her as his ""weapon"" again. Even though he shouldn't be all that too surprised by it like end up doing. 

Who needs a Death Star if you have the ultimate power to drain the force in any part of the galaxy? 

Then that brings the question of WHY Snoke wanted to simply kill her, or if he was just ""showing off"" to get the position she always deny to him!!??.

But that doesn't explain Kylo's side ether or why no one in the First Order has figured out that Snoke and Kylo are ""figure heads"" to the actual true ruler of the galaxy.

Luke doesn't know her as any previous student anyway(although this maybe Johnson's touch to the script, for all we know)    

Again thinks to that ever tin plated ""mystery box"", its hard to say anything without bring back the MARY SUE thing and if people still care to forget if Episode 8 ever really has impact on 9.

Retrospective story-reasoning will say things like ""it's because Obiwan needed to hide Luke where Vader wouldn't go"" but it was already well established and accepted by fans that it was a good enough hiding place because it *wasn't* important.  Also there's the idea that father and son grew up on the same planet with such different paths being some provocative idea but really despite being on the same planet they had not even remotely similar upbringing so there's no real poetry there.

The legend Luke Skywalker lives on. Inspired by his heroic sacrifice on Crait, the Resistance works tirelessly to organize a rebellion against the First Order's ruthless military occupation.

To that end, General Leia Organa has sent her most trusted military officers across the galaxy in an effort to unite the Republic worlds in opposition to her fallen son, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren.

But the last hope for galactic peace truly lies with the return of the Jedi Order. On a secret planet in the Outer Rim, Rey continues her study of the Force with the spirit of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker....",StarWars,True,1534804006,2018-08-20

The biggest injustice of The Last Jedi.,"While watching episode VIII tonight I'm reminded of the disappointment I feel when Admiral Ackbar is blown out of the cockpit of the resistance capital ship and given nothing more than an acknowledgement from Commander D'Acy. 
Ackbar deserved, at the very least, to pilot the medical frigate that was destroyed after evacuating the crew (hopefully all of them and as many supplies as possible?). This would've been an interesting, explorable plot point and served as a meaningful homage to the original trilogy. 
Just wanted to hear y'all's opinions on this matter whether you agree or not - it's not a matter I've heard discussed.",StarWars,True,1534824090,2018-08-21
A Thank You for whoever recommended “The Void” at Disney Springs,"About a month or so ago I was browsing Reddit and came across a post on this thread by someone who had just done”Secrets of the Empire” at ‘The Void’. In the post, they described it as an amazing walkthrough VR experience that was something not to miss at Disney. Being a huge Star Wars fan and knowing that I was going to be in Orlando this summer, I told my mother and she made reservations for us to go. 

This Morning I woke up at 8:15, took a shower, put on my favorite Darth Vader t-shirt, and arrived at ‘The Void’ at 10:00. I signed a waiver and before I knew it I put on a special VR suit. Along with my Mom and 2 others, we were turned into Stormtroopers and were flying in a ship with K2-S0. By the time It was all over I was absolutely speechless.

Words cannot describe how awesome the whole experience is. I won’t spoil the plot because it’s really cool to experience for yourself but I will say that if you’re a fan of Star Wars you owe it to yourself to try and get a reservation. Everything about ‘The Void’ is made to be immersive. You smell the environment, you can feel when you get shot, you can move your hands in front of your helmet and give a thumbs up and you can see it through your VR helmet. There’s no crack in the whole experience that takes you out of the immersion. You can even interact with things in the environment and your experience can change because of that.

The part that made the inner fan in me squeal was my conversation with the guy at the merchandise stand at the end of the whole thing. Again, I won’t spoil the story but there’s something at the end of the ride that is apparently going to be important in upcoming movies. So in other words, doing ‘The Void’ offers an excellent preview of future content. The other part that makes this a great thing for fans to do is that “Secrets of The Empire” is 100% Canon, so you’re basically inserting yourself into the Star Wars Universe.

I never would’ve known this was a thing if not for that Reddit post. So to whomever made that, I just wanna say thank you for the recommendation. I hope that whomever reads this also tries to get reservations for ‘The Void’ to experience the whole thing for yourself like I did. It’s truly worth it.",StarWars,True,1534827135,2018-08-21

To those who think the financial failure of Solo will send a message about TLJ...,"It won't.  Allow me to provide some historical perspective:

In May 2008 Marvel released the first film in its cinematic universe: *Iron Man*.  *Iron Man* was an enormous financial success making $585.2 mil off the back of a $150 mil budget.  One month later *The Incredible Hulk*, the second MCU movie was released riding the hype of Iron Man's success to a worldwide revenue of only $265.5 mil off the back of a $137.5 mil budget; to this date Mavel Studios' worst performing movie.

The MCU then proceeded to follow the formula of Iron Man for its next number of films and avoided the traits of *The Incredible Hulk* because... and here's the kicker... **Iron Man made more money!**  Despite our wishful thinking production companies don't use a financial flop as an opportunity to listen to fans, they use it as cause to try to identify what was wrong with the film that flopped.  They do this mostly internally but perhaps consult external professionals in the film industry.

If you didn't go see solo because you were disillusioned with the franchise then you did a totally reasonable thing, good on you.  It you chose not to see Solo because you wanted to provoke Disney to not make another movie like TLJ then you have only worked against yourself.  The time to send a message with your wallet about TLJ was when it was still in cinemas, not seeing it multiple times, even convincing people who hadn't seen it not to at all.  It's too late to undo that now.

TL:DR; If you didn't see Solo to send a message to Disney about TLJ then prepare for your message to be misunderstood.",StarWars,True,1534828455,2018-08-21

Luke looked up at the benevolence of Kenobi and uttered ""Lord, I shall follow you to the end of times. But the mighty Wampa has injured me, and I fear I am going to die."" said the boy, quivering in fear and in frost. The Lord smiled gently, and told to young Skywalker. ""Have faith in the force. For it, and I, will be with you. Always."" And the Lord vanished. Luke collapsed in the snow. All seem lost, until an Angel descended from the frosted horizon, clad in blue, mounted on a horned steed of grey. Han Solo dismounted and ran to the disoriented Skywalker, who spoke only 3 words. ""Ben... Dagobah... Yoda..."". Solo tried to bring Luke back home, but the Tauntaun had died of the cold. Without a second thought, Han took Luke's mighty blade, the Lightsaber, a weapon carried only by the Jedi of old, and cut open his mount, tearing out his organs and putting Skywalker inside. The Smuggler began work on a shelter.

I honestly think it'd be amazing. Sam would be fantastic at it, it could be like the star wars version of Logan or Venom, too much wall breaking in deadpool.

What do you think of TLJ now?,"Last night I watched TLJ for the first time since seeing it twice in the cinema upon release.  I think I am now more negative towards the film than 8 months ago, mainly because they have painted themselves into a corner with many of the choices RJ made.

I think TLJ has some of the best scenes out of any SW films, but as a whole has left JJ with a lot of ground to make up and lots of headaches

**What I like:**
Rey and Kylo relationship - the Force connections scenes are great
Death of Snoke - whole scene is tense and surprising
Kylo Ren - story arc has progressed and the acting is always great
The Holdo maneuver - still jaw dropping

**What I don't like:**
Canto Bite - just seems totally out of place, unconvincing, heavy handed and unecessary
Leaving Luke on Ach-To - just a massive waste of such a pivotal character
Luke and R2 - the one scene together on the Falcon was great and the re-use of the Leia message was too, but that's their only scene together. It's just a waste.
Luke in general - Why he wasn't saved to be given an heroic death in the in the next film I just don't understand.  I know this has been said many,many times over the last 9 months, but I now tend to agree with those that object to it.  For a character that is pivotal to SW that was introduced to us over 40 years ago, his arc is just disappointing.  No doubt he will come back as a Force ghost in Ep IX, but to not have proper, longer scenes with Leia, R2, 3PO, Chewie, in the Falcon, in an X-Wing, with a lightsaber is just a massive wasted opportunity.    
Death of Luke - if this is his death, the call back to the twin suns and the music is underwhelming and could have been much more emotional - if feels like the end of Infinity Wars i.e. they're not really dead
The First Order 'chase' of the Resistance -  it's just dumb and makes no sense
Poe's arc - he's underused in this film and ineffectual
Death of Leia - I know they didn't know what was going to happen to Carrie Fisher but her death scene would have been satisfactory if it had remained as such 
The spark that lights etc.. - stop saying it. It's spoken too often and sticks out like a sore thumb 'hey audience, don't forget this is important to the story..'

I get that RJ wanted to surprise us and mix things up but too many bad choices were made.  I can't think of how the story can develop to provide a satisfactory ending in the next, and last film of the Skywalker saga.",StarWars,True,1534864948,2018-08-21

Order 66 Discussion (Clone Wars Spoilers),"So I am a huge fan of the Clone Wars series. I loved how it handled mature concepts in an all ages way, developed characters leauges better than the prequels, and intorduced new character and ideas while respecting the lore. 

One thing that always bothered me though was how it retconned Order 66. From a dramatic point of view you want characters to always have agency, the ability to choose. So the decision to reduce Order 66 to a mind control chip removes any agency from the clones, who are arguably the best characters in the series. 

Remeber how loyal Plo-Koon was to his clones troops? What's more interesting? Commander Wolf betraying him because a chip in his brain told him to, or him agonizing over the decision being torn between two loyalties? 

Imagine when we catch up to the clones in Rebels or any other future work, seeing retired clones traumatized over betraying their friends, even if it was 'the right thing.' Versus ""oh not my fault, chip in my head made me do it. 

I'll acknowledge it makes perfect sense for Sidious to do anything to ensure the Grand Plan, just makes Order 66 so much less interesting.",StarWars,True,1534865775,2018-08-21

I'm starting to see a big problem in the entire SW community,"I think we've reached a point where is better to say that you're not a Star Wars fan.

Despite you like the new movies or not, you need to explain how you're not one of those ""toxic fans"". Specially if you talk about The Last Jedi, because people will even say who you voted for (even if you aren't from USA...).

This is something really serious, something Disney should stop as soon as possible.

If this feel of ""the Star Wars fans are toxic"" keeps getting bigger, how will the parents act about it? will they keep buying Star Wars toys to their kids? will they show the movie to their kids? or going with them to the Galaxy's Edge?

Star Wars is the fan base. Disney paid 4000 millions for the Star Wars name because of all the fans that name had.

Everytime there is a new article about how toxic the fanbase is, the franchise loses value, because less people will want to be related to thsi franchise, even if they're not ""toxic"".

I think the majority of people who don't like the Rose character, see Rose as simply unnecessary and a generic trope character. Even more so, they see her as detrimental to the overall story of TLJ. What it boils down to for them is: KMT did a good job portraying a crappy character.

The reason Luke was able to get Anakin back was because he wasn't apart of his father's past. He viewed Luke as his legacy because he wasn't there to witness what Anakin was.

Thoughts on how the Reylo arc will end . ( spoiler warning ⚠️ sequel and overall saga ),"To start I feel it is wise to warn of the obvious high risk of spoilers from the first 2 sequel movies and the saga up to this point . If I haven’t put any spoilers in this long post then there is still a risk of being spoilers in any potential replies it may receive . 

TLDR 

Please consider I have very rarely posted other than to comment so I do apologise if I have poor reddit etiquette I’m kinda new still . 


Right I will finally bloody start my fellow Jedi and/or Sith friends . 

Wether we/you/I like the fact or not the controlling faction in the senate is Emporer Mouse of Walt Disney so time everyone moved on or come to terms as it’s not going to change anytime soon . 

Taking that on board and regardless of liking it or fully against the matter Rey is our new “Disney Princess “ and I just can’t see how they can push for a “Reylo” love story type conclusion to the ST . 

I think and actually do hope and wish that Ben ( Kylo )finds some redemption as I feel that is a huge part of star wars and a big reason I love the whole things is the message of forgiveness and ability to change your life is a powerful message for everyone . 

As a way to make my point just imagine you have a daughter that’s going with not just a bad boy but a serial killing terrorist who murdered his father amongst other heinous crimes . 

Now you can’t help who you fall in love with and the message of even the worst people can change and be forgiven of their past but I just can’t see how they can push the fact of their new princess / role model can life happily ever after with someone with Bens past . 
Plus how will they justify it in story as the galaxy won’t forget what he has done just because he’s now a nice guy and he’s really really sorry . 

If he wasn’t the last Skywalker then I’d be totally fine with something akin to what we had with Vader/Anakin . Bit of redemption then off ya go . 

With it pretty much looking like Rey isn’t the Child of Luke or Leia then she won’t be a Skywalker or have the Skywalker blood or could she ????? 

Please hear me out as it’s just a thought I can’t shake from my mind . 

Are Disney and current Lucasfilm and the story group brave enough to make Rey the product of a cloning facility of the late Palpatine ? 
Maybe they have used some of the powerful Skywalker blood from Anakin and they managed to create a powerful clone actually wouldn’t need to be a clone if they used some little Vader dna and fertilised some eggs either from surrogates or the whole 9 months in a giant testube or however they do it in a galaxy far far away . 
Maybe her memory of being dumped on Jakku is just her nanny not having the heart to kill her when after the empower and second Death Star went pop the order was get rid of any and all things tied to the empire and she couldn’t bring herself to just kill her so she gave her to Jakku and that was that . 


So maybe that’s why she’s strong with the force and all the visions and why she seems familiar to people . Would make her and Ben family so that’s a good reason for them to love and care for each other but only platonic etc etc . 
Would leave it open for Ben to sacrifice himself if he had to and wouldn’t be the end of the Skywalker Blood line . 

They could end the ST with Ben being redeemed but starting the many life sentences he received in court and Rey can start training Jedi and people may be ok with that as she is pretty much a Skywalker really . 

And then a few years down the line the new sequel sequel trilogy opens with them having to get Ben from his prison as they need his help to save the galaxy etc etc . 


Well what do you all think ??? 
Am I on to something perhaps ?? 
Would they be brave enough to try something like this and if so will it be received pretty well ?

But...it is, though.

Alright, first off, if you don't like *The Last Jedi*, more power to ya. It'd be a boring world if we all liked the same things, you're not a bad person because you didn't like a *Star Wars* film and I'm not here to judge. I'm simply here to state why I liked a film.

Basically, I liked *The Last Jedi* because it is everything *Star Wars* is.

It's exciting, hopeful, human, funny, clever, thoughtful, and above all, fun.

First of all, on a purely superficial level, the film is gorgeous. The space battles are some of the best ever committed to film. Everything has weight, every laser blast and explosion has impact, and the film infuses them all with real emotional weight. I speak no lie that the opening fight with the dreadnought is one of the most emotionally investing fights I have ever watched.

Speaking of emotions, the acting in this film is spectacular. John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran are both endlessly charismatic, as is Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron but the real stars are Daisy Ridley, Mark Hamill and Adam Driver.

I liked Rey just fine in The Force Awakens just fine, but she really comes into her own as a character in Jedi. Ridley plays her as this confident, capable yet somewhat self-loathing character who starts of desperate to be a jedi , yet ends the film as something more. Rey was told her whole life that she was worthless, nothing, a nobody. But only by accepting that fact can she move beyond her nothingness and accept her true, best self.

Likewise, Driver's Kylo Ren is a magnificent character, one who's character is as deep as his pants are high. Much like Rey, he's riddled with self-hatred, but unlike how she is able to move past it and better herself, he simply can't look beyond his narrow worldview and thus falls back into pushing himself into something he's not. Ben Solo is not a murderer, or a dictator, but he is convinced that he is, leading to him making more and more violent and evil acts to make the square peg go in the round hole.

Mark Hamill meanwhile...jesus. Say what you will about Luke's character is portrayed (I personally love it) , but Hamill sells the shit out of it. He portrays Luke's pain, and loneliness, and grief in a manner that manages to be both saddening and real. Perhaps, too real for some.

Ultimately, I see *The Last Jedi* as an allegory for the Star Wars fandom itself. The First Order are the gatekeepers, the excludatory fools who drive people off of social media, who drive actors to near suicide, the ones who scream ""**this is for me and no one else!**"". It pains them to think that anyone else could enjoy Star Wars, especially women and people of colour.

The Resistance represents the open, inclusive, hope that Star Wars can represent. The side that wants to allow people in. They fight amongst themselves, but ultimately by focusing on what's truly important, and not giving into hate, do they survive (save what you love, don't fight what you hate).

There are people on the outside who will try to exploit your love of something (the Canto Bite people), but apathy only helps the truly toxic. Sometimes fighting may seem pointless, but it is important to fight anyway. And sometimes, it's also important to know when not to fight.

This is all kind of weighty stuff, but thankfully the film balances it all out with a good sense of humour. It never sacrifices comedy for drama or visa versa, but it does get a few good gags in there. (Poe Dameron's yo mama joke is hilarious, I *will* fight you on this)

After all, it's important to remember that *Star Wars* was originally never meant to be taken *that* seriously. At the end of the day, it's a fun space adventure. And *The Last Jedi* is a fun space adventure and more.

There's more I could go into, but I hope this explains why I found *The Last Jedi* to be such a wonderful film. It manages to say so many meaningful about *Star Wars*, whilst being the best Star that has ever Warred.

It is not perfect, but it is the best version of what it wants to be.

PS. Also, *Solo* was pretty good. Shame what happened to it.",StarWars,True,1534890559,2018-08-21

A Boba Fett Video game? [General Discussion],"Star Wars Bounty Hunter where you play as Jango Fett was a pretty good game for its time.

Given how video games have progressed massively since 2002. And the fact that Boba Fett has a wide spanning fan base, do you think there will be a Boba Fett centered video game, where you can hunt but with much wider open spaces and such than Star Wars Bounty Hunter?

Maybe given Boba's status you could just choose or even create your own missions in the game?

What sounds more interesting for a star wars story?,"The story will be set in bioware's swtor era.

So I have a pretty clear outline of how I want the story to go, but the first part of the story and how I see the first 1/3 to 1/2 of it, is going to be the training of a young force sensitive under a dark side user. I have two ideas for that and I want to know what sounds more interesting. The dark side master being a full fledged sith lord or just a powerful dark side user. 

That may seem like a minor difference but in my head I see it playing out as the sith lord being more cruel and causing more suffering to the apprentice and trying to further the aims of the sith empire. While just a general dark side user, unaffiliated with the sith, would be less cruel but more selfish in furthering his own desires.

My fervently held belief about the force,"All current knowledge we have about the force, both EU and cannon, is actually written from a solely Jedi perspective, and the way that Jedi use the Force is actually predatory and unnatural.  They focus on control, suppression, and removal of self to in essence exploit the Force and use it against the will of the Living Force. The Siths ""rage and hate"" control of the force is actually just them channeling the Force in a more natural way, and the reason the force is so full of rage and hate is because of the Jedi's use of it. Sith are told to ""give in"" to their emotions while channeling the Force, but what if they aren't giving in to their true emotions at all, but are actually giving in to the will of the Force. This would explain why Sith tend to be more powerful then Jedi and why they have a wider range of abilities, since the Force gives the gifts of its power freely to the Sith.

What's the deal with the Emperor's plan?,"This is kind of a response post. I was talking about the ""Force speed/teleport"" seen in ep1, and I was replied by saying I was just hating the prequels cause that's a bandwagon thing.

I'll now post this, proving that comment wrong, all while showing I'm just talking about my own opinions and thoughts.

Ok so in e6, Luke surrenders himself to the Empire for a variety of reasons. His motivation for this decision includes things like force users could sense him, so he had to get away from the rebels. Another reason is that Luke knew in his heart that Vader couldn't and wouldn't  kill him. 

His plan once surrendered was to turn Vader to the good side and prove the Emperor wrong.

What is the Emperor's thought process here? Well he knew Luke would end up alone with them, to confront them. Now his goal is to turn Luke to the dark side. He keeps talking about letting go and strike down his own father. Except the entire time Luke's there, he's acting like a pacifist. I really don't understand why the Emperor would think Luke would not only join the Dark side, but kill his own father to do so, with no motivation or reason to do so. This while Luke's trying to get Vader back to the light side with every fiber of his being. 

I will give the Emperor credit for making Luke want to kill him, which would lead to dark side emotions and Midiclorians, but it was played out in a really clunky way.",StarWars,True,1534935685,2018-08-22

"Any good EU based ""fan cannons"" or fan fiction writers groups out there?","Hey all

Can I just try to get ahead of things here by saying I don't want this to devolve into a love/hate TLJ flame war.  If you enjoyed TLJ or your enthusiasm for official Star Wars has survived it, i'm thrilled for you!  More power to you, and live/let live :).

So i've been taking a bit of a deep dive into the old EU (""legends"") stuff lately.  Started by replaying KOTOR I&amp;II, then doing the Revan audiobook.  Its kind of reminding me why I liked star wars to begin with.  However so far it hasn't repaired my enthusiasm enough to watch Solo, which is weird to me since its the first time in my life that there's an SW movie sitting there that I haven't seen.  I hear its OK, and might well get round to it once i feel an impetus.

In the mean time, i'm acutely aware that I will (at some point) exhaust the Legends cannon.  Doubly so as i'm not a big graphic novel/comic reader so I probably won't go much beyond the main instalments in that medium.  However, I do adore prose; and it occurs to me that this is the medium in which most fan fiction is written.

So my question is this, are there any good writers groups taking the Legends universe and running with it as a fan project?  The only things I dislike about fanfiction in general is that its hard to know a priori what the write qualities will be, and in the context of an overarching universe there's no consistency.  It seems to me a group working together, giving each other feedback, could go some way towards rectifying this.

Anyone aware of a project like this?",StarWars,True,1534944520,2018-08-22

Disney also thinks to make a good villain you do what I do when I have problems SCREAAAAM!!!!!. which leads to my next point which is I also really hate the Special Forces known as Death, Shore, and every competent looking enemy in Rebels since that just makes an excuse on how the Empire even managed to do anything with Stormtroopers. And you might be saying who cares or youre trolling but if we cant have good villains then why should we care about our heroes if theirs nothing to fear or know they can win any fight , use Clone Wars as an example for how to make menacing villains, even droids managed to aim and take down planets , B1s, B2s, where the things you hated to see since you knew they caused damaged, and even in Space the CIS dominated.

Leader of the Resistance,I was just thinking about who will be the Leader of the Resistance after TLJ. As we all know their numbers and leadership were annihilated in TLJ. It would be Leia of course but sadly she will not be in the next movie. So that leaves only a few options. Rey? Probably not as she will most likely be doing Jedi things and too busy getting into lightsaber battles. Poe? Maybe but I feel he is a dangerous candidate because he is one of their best pilots they have and they will need that skill to succeed. Finn is barely a Resistance member and Rose is just a mechanic. I don't get why Chewie hasn't taken the Falcon and flown off into the sunset already and he seems to be more and more regulated to a side character. That leaves me with just one idea. He is a character that has been through so much. Lost so many friends and compatriots. He has been around since the beginning of everything. He even currently has a sizable spy force sprinkled across the galaxy. That is right. I think the new leader of the Resistance will be: C-3PO!,StarWars,True,1534978828,2018-08-22

I love them both, but the more modern movies were easier to watch, more fun, had amazing CGI and an epic world scope. The Clone Wars TV show cemented my love for the Prequels, fleshing out the war and giving us new amazing characters such as Ahsoka Tano, Cade Bane (my personal favourite), Pre Viszla, Hondo Ohnaka, Clones such as Rex, Fives and Echo, and many more characters. And now r/pequelmemes has only doubled (and twice the fall) my love for those movies. They're absolutely hilarious to watch now, especially stoned! What are your thoughts on this.

I’ve had this alternate scene idea for Last Jedi for a while and it’s really stuck with me.,"The entire setup for the Battle of Crait proceeds as depicted in the film. However, Kylo Ren appears as a sole emissary of the First Order on the battlefield, expecting Leia, Holdo, or another high ranking Resistance member to meet him to deliberate terms of surrender. The walkers loom in the background, and shots of the remaining Resistance members indicate their defeated demeanor, as many of them are moving into the acceptance of their inevitable death. 

Leia walks out into the salt flats, ready to face what’s left of her son. Once Ren sees that she’s away from the base and approaching him, he orders an all out annihilation of the remaining Resistance forces. 

We cut to multiple First Order TIE fighter pilots receiving the order via radio. “STANDING BY TO ENGAGE” is repeated multiple times. But then, right before Ren orders the fighters to attack, we hear a soft static overtake. “Red 5 standing by.” 

Imagine “March of the Resistance” from the Force Awakens soundtrack playing behind the following suggestion:

Both the Milennium Falcon and a Rebellion-era X-WING appears over the mountainside, two ships, parallel to one another. They drive alone, straight into the onslaught of oncoming TIE fighters and walkers. 

Ren orders every fighter to attack the Falcon, trying to rid himself of his own self-fulfilling pain. Luke, piloting the X-WING along with Rey, fly directly up to the edge of all 15 AT-AT walkers before turning parallel to their walking paths. As all of the available First Order firepower destroys the Falcon, Luke shouts “now R2!”. At that moment R2 ejects Luke’s green lightsaber from the X-WING. Luke then yells, “Rey!”. From the backseat of the X-WING, Rey uses the force to balance the ignited lightsaber a few feet from the right side of the X-WING while Luke flys down the row of AT-AT walkers, the saber slicing the front legs of every single one.

Theory: Kylo used the force to save Leia in the last Jedi,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, what if Leia didn’t use some half assed force ability to float through space but Kylo in fact used the force himself to save his mother and pull her into the ship, supporting the idea that Rey accidentally killed her parents when she reached out to there ship using the force and Kylo lied to her about her parents to spare her from the pain of killing a parent and him not wanting to go through with killing Leia to not deal with the pain for a second time by killing his mother.

Interesting George Lucas interview on his decisions behind Anakin's character arc and midichlorians in the prequels.,"An excerpt from this (interview) [https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/george-lucas-and-the-cult-of-darth-vader-247142/] in 2005.

George: ....And also with Hayden in Episode II. He said, ""I don't want to be this whiny kid."" I said, ""Well, you are. You gotta be a whiny teenager.""

Interviewer: *Like father, like son.*


George: He said, ""I want to be Darth Vader."" I said, ""You gotta be a petulant young Jedi. You're not going to be the guy you thought you'd be when you signed your contract."" Hayden was grateful for this last movie, where he actually got to be Darth Vader.

Interviewer : *It was interesting how many people wanted to see Darth Vader massacre the Jedis.*


George: Well, when I said I was going to do the prequels, everybody said, ""That's great, we get to see Darth Vader kill everybody."" And I said, ""That's not the story."" When I announced that the first story was going to be about a nine-year-old boy, everybody here said, ""That's insane, you're going to destroy the whole franchise, it's More American Graffiti all over again."" And I said, ""Yeah, but this is the story.""

I don't have energy to just make hit movies. I'm not going to make James Bond Pt. 21 – I'm just not interested. Everybody said to drop the stuff about the midichlorians, it makes it too confusing. But it's a metaphor for a symbiotic relationship that allows life to exist. Everybody said it was going to be a giant turkey: ""This isn't going to help LucasFilm at all."" I said, ""This is about the movie and the company is just going to have to deal with whatever happens."" That's one of the reasons why there was so much hype on the first prequel: Everybody was terrified.

Interviewer: *Having thought of Darth Vader as this ultimate evil, it was alarming to see him as a cute kid in ""The Phantom Menace,"" as if we were watching home movies of Hitler.*


George: Well, a lot of people got very upset, saying he should've been this little demon kid. But the story is not about a guy who was born a monster – it's about a good boy who was loving and had exceptional powers, but how that eventually corrupted him and how he confused possessive love with compassionate love. That happens in Episode II: Regardless of how his mother died, Jedis are not supposed to take vengeance. And that's why they say he was too old to be a Jedi, because he made his emotional connections. His undoing is that he loveth too much.",StarWars,True,1535035289,2018-08-23

I need a Lego SW: The *Actually* Complete Saga,"I don’t know about y’all, but LSWTCS was and probably still is my favorite game. However, with recent technology, the game is somewhat outdated. The character customization is limited, the cutscenes have no words (just passionate grunts), and the content is lacking a couple of episodes. All I’m saying is that TT games would have an absolute banger on their hands if they remade TCS, but this time included episodes 7 &amp; 8 (and 9 when it comes out). Even include Rogue One and Solo side missions. Throw in some multiplayer co-op, maybe some PvP if they’re feeling ambitious, and updated character customization, I’d easily pay $60 for that. For how simple it is, Lego Star Wars is one of the best Star Wars games. TT games could take advantage of that, making both themselves and the consumers happy. ",StarWars,True,1535040128,2018-08-23
Something I want Episode IX to do - the public loves Kylo,"In the original trilogy, Palpatine is feared by all. Nobody follows him out of loyalty, but rather fear for their lives. Yes, there were some who admired him, but most, especially the public truly feared him. Same with Snoke, no one admired him and looked up to him, they looked at him with fear in their eyes and hearts. This leads me to Episode IX. I want them to do something different, I want Kylo to be loved by the public. He has brought order, stability, and peace to the galaxy, and the galaxy has entered a new golden era. This will make it hard for our band of heroes, as they won’t be able to get allies, as they will be seen as terrorists; wanting chaos and conflict, with the public looking down on them with contempt. Would make it hard for them to take down Kylo, as he’s making the galaxy thrive better than it has in the last 60-70 years and the citizens loving their new leader.

"People who hated the writing of TLJ, what do you make of this?","I don't expect that I will change your minds, but I think that what I have to say does lend some credibility to the opposite side of the argument. Let me preface this with the fact that I do not want to come across as mean-spirited in any way. I respect that there are many of you who don't like the film, and the writing even less. If you still don't like the writing for whatever reasons and aren't toxic about it, that is perfectly fine.

I had seen TLJ twice before I went again to see it with my mom, who hadn't seen it yet. My own opinions on the movie were pretty much solidified at that point. I loved the movie, and I thought the writing was great for the most part. Now, here's something to know about my mom. She got a PhD in theater arts, with a dual concentration in writing and theater production. Her mentor was Edward Albee, the 3-time Pulitzer Prize winning playwright best known for ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" According to my mom, he was a tough mentor, and she developed high standards for writing as a result.

After the movie was done, the first thing she said was, ""Who wrote that movie? That writing was absolutely incredible!"" Now, I know this sounds like me saying ""My mom said it was great so therefore it's great!"" But even if she wasn't my mom and just a random stranger, I think that it is safe to say that she has an extensive knowledge of what makes great writing (which I admit can be entirely subjective), and it is worth considering that someone who was personally trained by an award-winning world-renowned playwright thinks that the writing for TLJ is phenomenal (her words, not mine). Now, I know that writing a play and writing a film are different, but there is some significant overlap, so I believe that her opinion on the writing is a valid opinion, seeing that she was trained in a tangential but similar style.

When she asked about why it was so divisive, I tried to give her as unbiased an answer as possible. I mentioned, people weren't happy with Luke's portrayal, people saw it as abandoning the setups of TFA, various plot holes, etc. She flat out disagreed. So take that as you will.

I really want to hear everybody's opinions, but I am especially curious to know what those who were dissatisfied with the movie think of this. Normally I post in /r/starwarscantina, but since this subreddit has a higher amount of people who weren't happy with the movie, I think it would be better to make this post here.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think physical objects can be manipulated and felt via these projections and it's more teleporting rather than a hologram. 


Does this mean that Luke really did feel Kylo's lightsaber cut him in half and cause him to die? Normally I just thought that the strain from using the projections was enough to kill as mentioned in the movie.",StarWars,True,1533924405,2018-08-10

Thoughts from a rewatch of TLJ,"Rewatching TLJ tonight and I have a few observations:

- the thing I really dislike about this movie (and there is very little) is it doesn’t divide neatly into “acts” like the OT does. Tatooine, Death Star, Trench; Hoth, Dagobah, Bespin; Tatooine, Endor. TLJ jumps around WAY too much.

- What happens to Ben’s Blue Saber?

- I love OI as Poe. He is one of the few people who’s acting I never question.

- I want to see more of Luke’s convos with Yoda. Is this the first time they have spoken since Endor? Since Yoda’s death?

- In that strain, Luke accepts that he needs to teach Rey more. Failure, etc. For this reason I belove Force Ghost Luke will be back in IX.

- DJ is great also. The white ship he appears to be getting also seems great.

- Needs more aliens in speaking roles.

- I love all the woven goods.

- Snokes Long pink fingers really remind me of the newest Inquisitor.

- Even the nth time around, Holdo’s manuver still gets me. So pretty. And I get not ALWAYS using that strategy...but why not use one of the other ships that was going to fail earlier?

- I hope IX involves visiting a ton of new worlds to rebuild an alliance. ",StarWars,True,1533953784,2018-08-10
Long Shot but its killing me trying to find a Sound Effect for Darth Maul that isn't his theme or main music!

I made a quick video of said chant on one of the scenes. In this video its RIGHT as the droid comes ot Maul and lets him know of Qui Gon's location. 

Oh dear fans if anyone knows of it PLEASE let me know. Or if something can be subistituted in its place easily I would be more than thankful. Its so specific yet hard to describe its making my searching very difficult. A multitude of thanks to any leads for sure.

Do Star Wars fans think the dramatic moments in the prequel trilogy match the moments in the original trilogy?,"Personally, I really don’t like the prequels. ROTS did have some great moments in it, but overall it’s an inferior film. Anakin’s defeat by Obi-wan and Palpatine’s duel with Yoda were great scenes. However, they don’t nearly match the classic cinematic moments like Darth Vader’s redemption, Han being frozen in carbonite, or the revelation of Vader being Luke’s father. Those OT scenes aren’t just great SW scenes - they are some of the best scenes in all of movie history. Those scenes made me a SW fan. It’s a part of my childhood I will never forget.

I’m hoping that someone could shed light on this because I feel like maybe there is a book that may have went over this. I love the show and am ready for season 7 but this just leave me confused.",StarWars,True,1533955244,2018-08-10

"Why is Rey ""controversial"" while Ahsoka is beloved?","I'm not entirely sure if this kind of discussion belongs here, but I was curious what fans of the series thought about the subject. Rey is a character that plenty of fans are torn between loving her and hating her. Meanwhile, Ahsoka is beloved by the vast majority of people. I make the comparison because a lot of people claim that Rey is hated simply because she's a female protagonist, which I find misguided at best or ignorant and insulting at worst. But, I typically bring up Ahsoka to illustrate that the typical male fans don't blindly hate women. 

But, this comparison makes me curious. Both characters are female students of the force, specifically under the Jedi order, who studied (to different extents) under a Skywalker, and are the or one of the protagonists of a Star Wars series. Yet, one is a fan favorite and almost always has been while the other is controversial for lack of a better word despite being the main Jedi in the new films. 

My guess is either nostalgia from the Clone Wars or that she just has a more likable personality and grows as a character, but what do other people think about this. Or am I just off about this and Rey is more universally loved and Ahsoka is more meh to many than I initially believed?",StarWars,True,1533973105,2018-08-11

Do you guys think Rey will turn to the dark side in Ep XI ?,"To be completely honest I’m not the biggest fan of the Last Jedi but I thought I’d watch it again as their are certain parts that I like especially the training scenes with Luke. In rewatching those scenes you can really see how impulsive Rey is, she is unlike any Jedi we’ve ever seen before she is mostly fighting for selfish reasons and desires only to become a Jedi to be more powerful.  It seems the stronger she gets the more she is being drawn towards the darkness, I think it would really be an interesting dynamic if she were to turn if only for a short time to be redeemed at the end. (Also I think that Daisy would look really sexy in all black and a red lightsaber lol 😂) So how would you guys feel about her turning to the dark side at least just for a short time ",StarWars,True,1533975038,2018-08-11

Episode 9 - fate of the Galaxy?,"I was considering the most logical plot for this final episode and concluded it needed to be a combination of two adventure modules from the old West End Games Starwars Role Play Game:

1. **Tattoine Manhunt** involves rebels and bounty hunters scouring Tattoine for a Jedi. This would fit well with Rei searching for Obi Wan Kenobi's home and any light sabers he might have had in his posession. Plus Starwars is always better with Bounty Hunters - just ask Empire Strikes Back. So throw in some degree of escalating violence as the Bounty hunters blow up the Mos Eisley Space Port and the Millenium Falcon and Chewbacca so Rei has no escape.

2. **Black Ice** is a colossal cargo vessel used to transport fuel cells for the entire Imperial fleet. Who ever controls the vessel and its vast reserves will win the War. This is ideal for Finn to once again infiltrate an Imperial facility and be heroic while Poe and his x-wing blows away tie fighters in a space battle.

All this should end in a Space Battle above Tattoine... because where it began.

Favourite lightsaber duels. (only movies),"I know this has probably been questioned a lot on this sub, but I'd like to know of others opinions. Personally, my favourite is Luke vs Vader in ROTJ. There is so much emotion between both of them and near the end you get to see how much of Vader is in Luke. My second favourite is probably Anakin vs Obi Wan. It's the same thing with the emotion between the two, and also the fact that that it was the most fast and intense duel in the series.",StarWars,True,1534000906,2018-08-11
The most realistic scene in Star Wars.,"The scene where the Millenium falcon gets captured by the Death Star has to be one of the most realistic scenes in Star Wars as it gives an element of realism: showing what can only be assumed as Imperial protocol of having armed squads surrounding a captured ship until its determined it poses no threat, personnel hustling around the hanger bay to secure whatever they're securing and general foreman over the PA system announcing something official sounding (""one, five, seven and nine, release all charges"") and sound effects backing it up. The Falcon's main ramp is lowered, so it looks as if they have already done a general scan to determine no explosives, chemicals or any other threats are posed as well as a search for any of the ship's personnel. Its just a cool scene that looks very authoritarian (very reminiscent of the old Leni Riefenstahl films of the Nazis in the 1930's)﻿ ",StarWars,True,1534001141,2018-08-11

What do you think Snoke really was? [TLJ],"Snoke didn’t use a lightsaber at all and was clearly INCREDIBLY strong with the Force. Prior to TLJ release Pablo Hidalgo said he wasn’t a Sith or a Jedi but was a powerful Force user. I just came off a CW binge so maybe I’m grasping at straws, but do you think Snoke was maybe a less powerful Force-wielder? Something like the Brother, perhaps? In the Mortis arc the brother sought to use Anakin as a tool of taking over the universe, and its clear Kylo shares some of the traits of Vader. I know we see them die but it’s clear that there are beings capable of using the Force without the restrictions of any order. If it did turn out to be the case I think it would be a cool link to the prequels. 

TL;DR: 
What is Snoke? Could he be a Force-wielder like the Mortis gods?

E9: Dark Side Rey The Natural Way,"Thumbnail argument why an evil Rey and good Kylo may actually be a natural narrative for E9:

Years on from Crait Rey has had to stoke the dying flame of the Resistance alone and by sheer will.  In an asymmetric war her unmoderated zeal becomes compelled hardness and then seeps inevitably inward, a presence she hardly even resists.

Elsewhere, Kylo Ren's broken resolve likewise seeps inward.  He softened toward his mother; he softened toward Rey.  The coup against someone in that state is easy for Hux.  And now exiled in another system Ren tumbles into spiritual disintegration.

Luke haunts him.  Appearing first as a demon, but inexorably as his commiserate and gradually angelic sage.  Here Kylo finally obtains that sense so elusive to the Jedi: humility.  He repents in dust and ashes.  All poison drained from him now, he nonetheless drifts without current somewhere at the edge of the galaxy.

Meanwhile, the Resistance grows more and more lethal as Rey calcifies into mania.  Hux is finally swept under by her, and now she overturns the galaxy not in search of a Jedi helper but her only remaining enemy.

So the stage is naturally set for a final conflict between the children of failed ideologies and unprecedented power.  A Rebel turned demagogue and a broken Jedi apostate.",StarWars,True,1534048918,2018-08-12

The Star Wars Timeline Gold has ended,"Just wanted to give a shout out and a bit of thanks to Nathan P Butler.  

The Star Wars Timeline was started in 1997 as a way of chronologically listing all the events in the films, books and games.

This was actually my introduction to the EU and is something that I've followed along with for years.  It really heightened my fandom and allowed me to dive into other stories that I wouldn't have given a look to otherwise.

It's a shame to see it go but it's nice to see it's for a positive reasons.  The level of geekiness in putting this all together was always heartwarming and interesting to me and many others, and the monster level of work is admirable. 

Thanks Nathan for all the years you put this together and for really delving into the EU deeply so I didn't have to.

The difference in animation quality from the animated Clone Wars movie to the later seasons is incredible.,"I'm currently rewatching the series in chronological order and seeing the roughness of the movie in comparison to how beautiful and fluid the later seasons look is pretty impressive.

To be fair, it doesn't look horrendous for the most part and the lighting effects are actually quite good at times, but then other scenes look like poorly rendered PS2/early PS3 quality cutscenes.

Watching the animation improve as the show progressed was always something I noticed and appreciated as the show aired, but I had forgotten just how rough it looked at the start. 

I wonder if they had the same budget to complete the new episodes as they did in the final seasons, as it would be a shame to see the quality dip in these final episodes.",StarWars,True,1534075539,2018-08-12

"I was reading ""Death Star"" and came up on a nice succinct explanation for why everyone forgets the Jedi","""The Emperor had ordered a complete ban on any and all data having to do with Jedi and the Force. So thorough had been the revisionism that now, barely two decades after the Jedi heroism of the Clone Wars, nearly every reference in every data bank in the galaxy had been purged of matters and information relating to the order. Most beings born since then knew little, if anything, about those larger-than-life characters whose names had once been on everyone’s lips, and their elders were smart enough not to talk about the subject.""

I especially like the parents being smart enough to not talk about it part. Because if they did talk about it that would end up with them in a imperial prison or worse.

Two character arcs were mixed up in TLJ,"Maybe people are over TLJ discussion, but something has been gnawing at me and I had to throw this out there to see what people think. Hear me about because this might sound crazy. *Luke Skywalker and Admiral Holdo's character arcs should have been swapped*.  In the film, Holdo is a misunderstood hero with benevolent intent, and Luke is a cliched trope of a washed up former bigshot turned loser who finally comes through in the final and most desperate hour of need. Neither of these really resonated with audiences, but imagine them reversed. JJ's mystery box of what Luke went in search of was left empty in TLJ. So imagine instead, that he had some kind of force maguffin he went in search of, but he alone had the power to handle it. Perhaps the search for said maguffin had even contributed to Ben's turn to the dark side. He knew his loved ones would insist on helping if they were in the loop, and he knew it would destroy them, so he has to keep them in the dark. It would also explain Luke's expression when he meets Rey at the end of TFA. So he fools Rey into thinking he's a suicidal hermit loser, only to reveal his true, heroic intentions at the end. I'd even say keep all the rest, the force projection, even his death, but his death would actually be a heroic sacrifice rather than dying of a bad headache or whatever, so you picture him doing the force projection while, a cave collapses around him or some such, as he completes his true purpose and leaves the path to victory unlocked for the resistance. 

And then, there's Holdo. Her arc was there to develop Poe Dameron. I'd tweak his story a little so that his growth doesn't come from going from a cringe edgelord to someone who learns to fight more conservatively; let's say, instead, he genuinely fails in his defense at the start of the film and takes it hard. Maybe his best buddy gets killed in the attack, no your momma jokes, just a guy who does his best, comes up short, and takes the loss very personally and comes to doubt his worthiness as a leader. His growth then comes from regaining his confidence by standing up to the genuinely craven Holdo who really is trying to abandon ship. Holdo, recognizing her failures, volunteers for the kamikaze run and earns a last minute redemption after ensuring the future of the resistance is in good hands with it's new leader Poe. 

tl,dr: Holdo is a loser who redeems herself in the end, Luke is misunderstood until the very end when the audience learns he was actually secretly working to save everyone the entire time. 

Bonus!  There's not much salvaging Canto Bight, but I think it would have been more interesting if they ditched the whole secret mission concept and made the story instead that Finn actually abandoned the Resistance and Rose or another standin went to bring him back. Finn wakes up from his coma to see the Resistance defeat and Poe's anguish, and nopes out in the escape pod. He is angry and obstinate over the mission to bring him back, and finally learns to step up to the plate and accepts his value.",StarWars,True,1534079378,2018-08-12

Armor...what’s the point,"So I’ve been watching clone wars, I’ve seen every movie, and it’s joked about all the time, but the armor stormtroopers, clones, and well anybody use what’s the point of it? All we see is people get shot with this stuff on and it’s useless. It’s it just a kickass uniform, or does it actually work?

I’ve always kinda assumed the armor does do something, but we don’t see it in the movies (just like how in the movies no one can aim for shit unless they a main character).

I suppose you could argue that it’s a blaster shot and nothing can really stop it, but if a planet killing space station, and lightsabers exist I don’t think it’s too far of a stretch to think there is a functional piece of armor out there.",StarWars,True,1534084343,2018-08-12
"For those of you interested in episode IX, can you answer this question?","So, first and foremost, I do not want to argue, debate or insult in this thread. I was not a fan of TLJ but I do not want petty insults and arguments here. I'm genuinely curious about what I'm asking  and would love input from those fans.

So at the conclusion of TLJ, Rey has become stronger then before and is now the last Jedi. Kylo has apparently taken over the FO, at least we can assume this anyway. Hux seems to be the only one against him, and he's too big of a weenie to fight Kylo.

With the sequel coming, I do feel like Rian has written JJ into a corner. With Snoke dead, Kylo seems to be the biggest villain available to Rey. But, hasn't she already beat him once before? I mean, technically twice if you think about it. So where is the tension in the story?

With Rey having already beat Kylo once, is anyone wondering who would win in a battle between them? Those of you excited for the sequel, what are you looking to get out of it? For me, with Rey winning, there seems to be no tension for the next big battle between Rey and Kylo.

Furthermore, it seems the movie will end in either one or two ways; Rey beats Kylo in battle and kills him or they join forces and defeat another big baddie. That's it. What else is there?

Again, please, let's keep the fighting and argument to an all time low please.",StarWars,True,1534085451,2018-08-12
What would a good alternate title for the Canon continuity?,"Hello everyone,

I'd just like to start by saying that I'm not trying to spark arguments in the slightest, I'm just genuinely interested in finding out what peoples' ideas are about this.

So basically, after the Disney takeover, the old continuity was renamed 'Legends', a name some hate but I think captures the essense of that continuity quite nicely as I've always seen Star Wars as being a set of stories told about a fictional historical period.

Say that the new continuity had its name changed for whatever reason.

Other perspectives of the trench run,"I've been reading (or rather listening to) Inferno Squad lately, and really enjoyed the first chapter, which describes the trench run from the perspectiveo of a TIE pilot who survived the DS explosion. I also know that Lost Stars showed it from the perspective of a SD crew member and obviously, there is the perspective of Luke himself in ANH.

Are there any other stories (canon or not) which describe the run from yet another perspective? Like a rebel pilot who missed the hole or someone on Yavin IV overseeing the operation?

Why do they think that concluding the Skywalker saga is a good idea?,"The Skywalker saga has been keeping alive the franchise for decades. The fans wanted to know what happens with the Skywalker saga, the the new Republic, the new Jedi order, etc... All of it from Luke's or Leia's point of view.

Why do Disney and Abrams think that was a good idea to get rid of all of that? Or even a good idea to promote IX after how people reacted to Luke's death?

We already the chance to see it in the sequels, but now we won't even have more Skywalker family to follow the story. 

Do they really expect that the new characters will be selling comics and toys for the next 20 years when they aren't even selling now?

This saga needs a full reboot right now. We need a proper VII-VIII-IX with a younger cast and with a proper story telling what happened after VI, showing the original trio reunited, the Jedi academy and the new Republic.

Given that the first two chapters of the new trilogy take place over just a couple of weeks at most, I think it makes sense to stretch out the conclusion a bit to give the final chapter a little more weight.

How can we let the past die when the conflict of the Sequel Trilogy is just the Rebels vs the Empire again?,"Let me start out by just flat-out saying, *the First Order, is the Empire* point-blank, they are identical, they have stormtroopers, star destroyers, imperial shuttles, death stars, and are both ruled by darksiders.

Now, in TLJ, the Resistance goes from just looking and acting exactly like the Rebels to directly calling themselves the Rebels, so that's that. 

Yet, people (Disney) keep telling me I need to let the past die, forget the Original Trilogy, and accept the Sequels. But, how can I do this when the current conflict is basically identical to the original conflict (but on a smaller feeling scale)? 

I'm sorry, I just really can't get over the fact that the Sequels feel like a complete rehash and almost nothing else. The accomplishments of the original characters have been completely destroyed, rendering both the OT and PT completely moot. And, honestly, for all the hate the prequels are shown, at least the Clone War was nothing like the Galactic Civil War.

Do people really believe that their is no hidden canon level and that the books and comics are as canon as the visual media and can change them?,"Legends post Zhan had a sort of proto story group under Lucas Licensing which tried to help writers fit their stories into the universe and give them stuff they could add to their stories (locations, ships, people, etc) kind of like the modern day story group that would replace them. One of the things they did was create a canon heirechy. Basically a really simple pyramid of power where anything on top was more important than what was below it.  For example the movies were on the tip top and nothing could contradict that  however they could change what was below them. And say books two levels down could not contradict the movies or tv shows but could contradict the comics and games. Basically it was a very easy level of Movie&gt;TV&gt;Book&gt;Comic&gt;Game&gt;Reference book&gt;RPG. Also one that most people didn't even know or care about its existance.

Basically it was just a simple and easy way to say what source you should take as the most reliable if you found a contradiction. To use a infamous example from the NEU it would say that the Poe comic was of a higher level than the YR novel and that the story without the fart wedding was the one that truly happens. It was also a way of overwriting continuity errors. Now days the Story Group loves to use ""unreliable narrator"" (which really only makes sense in first person books) as an excuse when before they could just look at the list and say ""Darth Vader Annual 2 is on a lower level than Catalyst therefor no Darth Vader did not send a warning about the DS plans to Lyra Erso"" 

I'm giving a example of what it is and how it works because I have a question. Do people really think their isn't still a canon level? I mean yes their isn't a official level like their was in Legends. But do people honestly believe that their is not a heirechy in what can change and modify what? 

Star Wars has always been a multimedia enterprise. But the NEU is quite different in Legends in that their are multiple movies and tv shows coming out. Their are hundrends of millions of dollars being poured into each and every one of these projects. The new Mando show (well maybe mando we don't know) is apparently costing ten mill per episode. Even as base breaking as it was millions of people saw The Last Jedi. the NEU is bound tightly to these projects  due to the money that goes into them and the audience that it will reach. A audience that is much larger than the books and comics and even the games (and I say this as a guy who loves the books and comics and wall my stories in that form) 

So my question is do people really believe that they will allow books or comics to change anything about characters or the universe that would affect the movies/tv shows or have to be explained to a audience. I mean on one hand we did get a character reveal in Solo that was great (I'm mentioning him and not the one in RO because it is a change the GA would be able to see and recognize) but that is coming from one major production that had a huge viewer base and not say a book or comic. 

On the other hand we have the fact that all of the books have been tie-ins or tie-ins disguised as character histories. Nothing has been allowed to give any real answers on anything or expand or change anything that would have to be explained to a wider audience. Now part of that is due to the whole mystery box and many of the writers not even knowing whats going on. But it seem inconceivable that they would allow a book or comic that doesn't cost much to make dictate a multimillion dollar enterprise. 

Now some people would say that wouldn't happen because the Story Group is there to make sure everything is on the same page with a outline. But as has been stated before that's not really the Story Groups job and if it was they aren't doing it very well. 

So TLDR: Do you believe that their isn't a canon level at all, hidden or otherwise. And that the books and comics are truly as canon as the movies/tv shows and able to change and direct them like the movies/tv shows are able to change and direct the paths of the books.",StarWars,True,1534122594,2018-08-12

When was Darth Vader really born?,"&gt;""A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father."" — Obi-Wan Kenobi

What really caught my ear (even after years of watching this scene) was how Obi-Wan actually refers to Darth Vader as a pupil of his. It changed my perspective on Anakin's turn to the Dark Side, which we really begin to see glimpses of in Attack of the Clones. Especially when he murders the village of Tusken Raiders. I'm not really asking when precisely Darth Vader was ""born"", but whether or not it was before Sidious gave that name to Anakin. It would seem that from Obi-Wans perspective, the name itself was only bestowed on a piece of Anakin that existed long before he swore fealty to Darth Sidious. A piece of him that grew so large that it left the rest of him in darkness. And that piece of him began as a Jedi, even when Anakin still was too.",StarWars,True,1534150391,2018-08-13

Morality shift (spoilers...duh),"Just want to start a discussion about something that I think has been glanced over, maybe it’s already been pointed out but I haven’t seen it anywhere. This is about Rey in TLJ. This is not about if TLJ is good or bad, it is not about the directors or producers or Kathleen. It’s about the content of the film.

So some moral background 
- Rey is a starving poor orphan from a desert planet.

- She finds a new shiny droid and refuses to sell it for a lot of food because it doesn’t belong to her.

- protects droid from thieves.

- Attacks Finn because he might have stolen Poe’s jacket.

- Basically she is morally a goody goody.

Now in TLJ she goes straight for the dark side, ignores Lukes warning of the consequences of Jedi presence on the galaxy.She decided Luke was a lost cause and now for the part that I think gets glanced over, she stole his sacred Jedi texts. Before people complain, I know the Sacred Texts are a meme but I’m not talking about them but the morality of Rey stealing.

Remember that she did not go to Luke for training that is just a happy coincidence. She went to ask him for his help saving the resistance. So when exactly did she decide she really needed those books?

Did you guys notice the moral shift?

Was there a moral shift?

Am I just overthinking?, has this already been discussed.

A very basic analysis of the amount of death in Star Wars,"I've been thinking about the amount of death in Star Wars and decided to do a pretty crude analysis of deaths in all three trilogies, the anthologies and both animated shows. The results were quite surprising to say the least.

First of all, I'm not counting faceless grunt deaths. I'm only counting the characters that are somewhat notable, such as having a few lines of dialogue or some in-universe significance. For example, I'd count Jedi like Kit Fisto because of his multiple appearances in The Clone Wars but fellow Jedi Agen Kolar would not feature since his only appearance is for a few seconds in Episode III. I don't claim this to be a perfect list of deaths but it's as close as I can do.

I'll make a distinction between 'notable deaths' which are of semi-important characters and 'major deaths' which are of lead characters from that film/show/the whole franchise. Qui Gon Jinn, Savage Opress and Darth Vader would count as ‘major’ whilst characters like Plo Koon, Admiral Ackbar or Bodhi Rook are ‘notable’.

I’ve broken it down into two statistics:

* Major deaths per hour - the average number of major characters who die per hour
* Significant deaths per hour - the average combined number of major and notable characters who die per hour.

I’ll reiterate that this is a very basic and simple thing done out of curiosity and if there’s any contention then keep it civil and put it in the comments. I almost missed Captain Phasma when doing this so if there’s other characters who belong on this list then let me know and I’ll factor them in.

**The Prequel Trilogy - 6.9 hours**
Major deaths - Qui Gon Jinn, Jango Fett, Count Dooku, General Grievous, Mace Windu, Padme Amidala.
Notable deaths - Zam Wessel, Shmi Skywalker, Kit Fisto, Saesee Tiin, Ki Adi Mundi,  Aayla Secura, Plo Koon,Commander Gree, Nute Gunray, Wat Tambor, Poggle the Lesser.

Major deaths per hour - 0.87
Significant deaths per hour - 2.46

The Prequels have the advantage of not only having to clear house for the OT but also of having The Clone Wars. The animated show helped build up the background characters, such as Plo Koon or Wat Tambor, so that their deaths actually mean something in the films. You can add endlessly to the list of background Jedi but I added all of the ones who we see die and actually have some story to them.

A few characters like Shaak Ti aren’t counted because, even though they do die during the events of the films and would count as notable, their deaths aren’t seen in the final product.



**The Original Trilogy - 6.317 hours**
Major deaths - Obi Wan Kenobi, Grand Moff Tarkin, Boba Fett, Yoda, Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker, The Emperor.
Notable deaths - Greedo, Owen Lars, Beru Lars, Biggs Darklighter, Jabba the Hutt.


Major deaths per hour - 0.95
Significant deaths per hour - 1.74

The Original Trilogy is one of the only places where the ‘major’ deaths outnumber the merely ‘notable’ ones. It easily takes the cake for how important the deaths are, killing off not only the saga’s key hero in Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader but also characters like Yoda, Obi Wan and the Emperor. 

I counted Boba Fett since his survival is not confirmed as of yet. I also skipped over one or two characters; Admiral Piett has too little a role to be featured and the likes of Bail Organa and Colonel Yularen are denied a place on the list because their deaths are only implied and not really seen. Biggs just about made it since I think his relationship with Luke makes him important enough to qualify. Also, no. I'm not counting Porkins.



**The Sequel Trilogy - 4.783 hours**
Major deaths - Han Solo, Supreme Leader Snoke, Luke Skywalker, Captain Phasma.
Notable deaths - Lor San Tekka, Admiral Ackbar, Amilyn Holdo.

Major deaths per hour - 0.84
Significant deaths per hour - 1.46

For only two films, the Sequels have really been deadly to major characters. The Last Jedi in particular really did a number on its characters. With Episode 9 all but guaranteeing Leia’s death and certainly others too, the Sequel Trilogy could easily prove to be the most costly of the Star Wars saga.

**The Anthology Films - 4.467 hours**
Major deaths - Jyn Erso, Director Krennic.
Notable deaths - Cassian Andor, K2S0, Baze Malbus, Chirrut Imwe, Bodhi Rook, Galen Erso, Admiral Raddus, Saw Gerrera, L337, Dryden Vos, Tobias Beckett, Val, Rio Durrant.

Major deaths per hour - 0.45
Significant deaths per hour - 3.36

Rogue One catapulted this category into the highest number of significant deaths per hour with ease. I suppose there could be debate that L3 or even K2 count as major characters but I played it safe and stuck with the main protagonist and antagonist of Rogue One. Solo spared most of its core cast like Han, Chewie and Q’ira but still took out its fair share of new characters too.

**Star Wars: The Clone Wars - 48.233 hours**
Major deaths - Duchess Satine, Savage Opress, Fives.
Notable deaths - Heavy, Nahdar Vebb, Onaconda Farr, Commander Ponds, Clone 99, Ima Gun Di, Ziro the Hutt, The Daughter, The Son, The Father, Even Piell, Osi Sobeck, Riff Tamson, Captain Tarpals, Hardcase, Waxer, Pong Krell, Queen Scintel, Adi Gallia, Steela Gerrera, Pre Viszla, Tup, Master Tiplar, Rush Clovis, Admiral Trench.

Major deaths per hour - 0.062
Significant deaths per hour - 0.58

The Clone Wars has a fearsome reputation for being dark, gritty and full of death. To an extent, that is true. Many clones, droids, pirates and mercenaries get cut down en masse. However, its focus on characters like Anakin, Obi Wan, Dooku and Yoda and the de facto plot armour of Ahsoka left its death count surprisingly lower that expected. Numerically, it had many more deaths than the films but these were spread out over a much longer run time.

There are a few questions to be raised about what counts as ‘major’ or ‘notable’. Fives’ status is debatable but I felt his meaningful death and the amount of times he showed up marked him as major. As for ‘notable’ there’s many named clones and Jedi that fall but most aren’t of any real importance. The likes of Bolla Ropal or Commander Thorn do die but their appearances are so brief and their roles so small that they simply don’t qualify for consideration. Still, many characters who only feature in one episode, like Ima Gun Di, or one arc, like Osi Sobeck, do appear since they play such an important role in their respective stories. 

There is also the issue of what would have happened had the show not been cancelled. I did count The Lost Missions and the unfinished story reels but I didn’t count Son of Dathomir, Dark Disciple or anything that wasn’t shown. Therefore, the deaths of Talzin and Ventress and the likely end of Cad Bane don’t factor into this since, at the end of the day, they didn’t happen in the show.

**Star Wars: Rebels - 27.5 hours**
Major deaths - The Grand Inquisitor, Maul, Kanan Jarrus
Notable deaths - Taskmaster Grint, Commandant Aresko, Minister Tua, Seventh Sister, Fifth Brother, Eighth Brother, Gar Saxon, Commander Sato, Admiral Konstantine, Tiber Saxon, Brom Titus, Vult Skerris, Rukh, Commander Gregor, Governor Pryce.

Major deaths per hour - 0.11
Significant deaths per hour - 0.65

For all the talk of Rebels being all light-hearted and ‘for kids’, it ultimately proved to be deadlier to its characters than its sister show did. Despite its much smaller roster and narrower focus, characters were dispatched at a decent pace. The villains in particular suffered harshly but even heroes like Gregor or Kanan met their end along the way. Tiber Saxon and Brom Titus are in similar positions to Riff Tamzin or Nahdar Vebb in The Clone Wars where their vital role in a small number of episodes warranted them a place on this list.

Like The Clone Wars, there’s a few that only narrowly missed this list. A few minor villains like Seevor or people like Morad Sumar died but their roles are too minor to include. Also, even though we learn about Luminara’s death in the show and Ezra’s parents die during the time period, we don’t see them happen on screen so they can’t be counted.

**Conclusion**

Star Wars is no stranger to death and it was interesting to see the numbers laid out. One thing I’ve never really thought about is that The Empire Strikes Back killed the fewest important characters, with no one of much significance meeting their end. Revenge of the Sith was unsurprisingly the deadliest film followed by Rogue One.

Obviously, the amount of death doesn’t make up for how meaningful or well executed that moment is. That’s a big reason why I didn’t chose to look at faceless grunt deaths since they mean nothing and don’t impact the story in any real way. Also, deaths range between peaceful and gruesome. Yoda’s quiet death in bed is a far cry from Maul bisecting an Inquisitor with a saber throw. 

At the end of the day, death is no real metric to measure something by. It’s an interesting thing to consider and think about but at the end of the day its the story and characters that makes Star Wars what it is, not the body count it leaves behind.

I could be wrong, but I just can't see the entire Resistance at the start of IX being a couple dozen members crammed onto the Falcon. Also, the way broom kid is telling the legend of Luke on Crait at the end of TLJ seems to suggest that time jump has already happened. On top of this, I their fight Luke tells Kylo something along the lines of the Resistance is reborn today (blanking on the wording) which suggests to me that Disney will probably skip over any Resistance recruitment campaign.

So if this line of thinking is correct and the Resistance is already largely rebuilt by the start of IX it leaves me with one question, who will their new allies be? What do you think, will the Resistance be rebuilt inbetween episodes, and if so, by who?",StarWars,True,1534169678,2018-08-13

Something that's been bothering me about Ahsoka returning...,"I didn't notice this before when the comics came out (though I haven't read them so I didn't really give much thought to it) but I am personally having a bit of a problem with Ahsoka coming back.


There have been 3 crucial women in Anakin's life: his mother, his wife, and his apprentice (the latter of which he personally trained and fought side by side with through most of the 3 years of war and watched grow not just as a Jedi but as a person). Now whether of not ~~Palpatine~~ The Senate was secretly behind Ahsoka leaving I won't figure into this. But in AotC Anakin lost him mother, then in the SE5 finale of TWC [SPOILERS] (Ahsoka leaves the order and in a way abandons Anakin.) Then finally he has the same dreams of his wife dying that he had about his mother. That is what I believe drove him to the dark side: these three women who he feels tormented about losing or possibly losing. [And if you don't think Anakin had negative reactions later on about Ahsoka leaving the order, look at this clip from an unfinished Clome Wars episode] (https://youtu.be/6UwklEWJvmg) (btw, knowing what happens in RotS, this scene is super sad)


Anyway, I'm seeing a problem with Ahsoka coming back. AotC is when he loses Shmi, TFW is when he loses Ahsoka, and RotS is the last straw when he's threatened with losing Padme, and becomes Darth Vader in trying everything he can to save her. He is so shaken by that point, yet with Ahsoka returning it means he could find comfort in talking to her. Although she is busy with the Siege of Mandalore, she is literally with Captain Rex and I think (most of) the 501st. And we saw that she knew about Anakin and Padme, and he knows that she knew.


He could have consulted in her and asked for her opinion or just try to make him feel better by talking to her. He just saw her on the holo before the Siege of Mandalore and the Battle of Coruscant (I mean that could contribute to Anakin being in a good mood at the beginning of RotS). But I don't know, it just feels like that pillar of women in his life which should be shaken to it's core by RotS, is a little more durable with Ahsoka coming back.",StarWars,True,1534171552,2018-08-13

Episode 9 Personal Predictions,"Right now we don't really have a very good idea of what is supposed to happen in Episode 9, however i have come up with i few things i hope will occur.

1. Both the Jedi And Darkside users(Kylo ren, and possibly the Knights of ren), will cease to exist. As Luke metioned in The Last Jedi about the Jedi Order ""At the Height of their power, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create The Empire and wipe them all out"". However at the Height of The Siths power they were brought down by Luke Skywalker. It seems to me that whenever someone has too much power they will be defeated at some point. Therefore i belive that there neither The Light or The Dark will win in episode 9. The Force does not belong to anyone.
2. Both The Resistance and The first Order will be destroyed along with The Jedi and Kylo Ren. Since the force has always been linked with the current galactic government (Republic=Jedi, Empire=sith), i think there will be no new government in the end of the sequels, unlike the way it has been in the two other trilogies. The galaxy will start fresh. 

I think the goal of The Sequels should be to bring balance to the galaxy and The Force, to let is start over. To end give a satysfing end to the Luke Skywalker, The Jedi And all what we love, so that all of the new Star Wars won't be the same ideas of  Galactic Empires And Force Sensetives, recycled over and over.

"Who do you think should succeed John Williams as the composer for ""Star Wars"" movies and TV series?","Personally, I think Austin Wintory would be a good, if albeit ""untested"", candidate.

&gt; Austin Wintory (born September 9, 1984 in Denver, Colorado) is an American composer who composes scores for films and video games.

&gt; He is particularly known for composing the scores to the acclaimed video game titles *Flow* and *Journey*, the latter of which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media (the first for a video game). 

&gt; His film efforts include the scores to the 2009 Sundance hit *Grace*, as well as the 2008 Sundance Audience Award winner *Captain Abu Raed*. Wintory has composed 300 scores since 2003.

I say that Wintory should succeed Williams, because Wintory had phenomenal success with his music composition for *Journey*, among his other scores and soundtracks. So much so, that he was nominated at the Grammy Awards in 2013 for his music, alongside John Williams, in a shocking first...a category that John Williams himself would later go on to win in 2017, for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.

&gt; On December 5, 2012, Journey received a Grammy nomination for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, becoming the first video game score to receive a Grammy nomination, sharing the category with John Williams' *The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn*, Ludovic Bource's *The Artist*, Hans Zimmer's *The Dark Knight Rises*, Howard Shore's *Hugo*, and Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross's winner, *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*. 

&gt; [...] Prior to the Grammy nomination, Wintory described video games as having evolved into ""a full-blown art genre that is right alongside literature, and any other form of storytelling"". 

&gt; Wintory wrote for Grammy.com, ""No amount of interviews, congratulatory emails or Twitter high-fives will ever make the side-by-side listing of Austin Wintory and John Williams feel like part of this reality."" (Wikipedia)

You can listen to Austin Wintory's soundtrack for *Journey* [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3hFN8UrBPw), which fits right in with the desert scenes in *Star Wars* (Tatooine, Jakku) and *Dune* (Arrakis) as well. To this day, it's one of the only video game scores to be nominated for an iconic Grammy Award category. 

What's more, Wintory's soundtrack for *Journey* was also heavily influenced by the same source that George Lucas was for *Star Wars*: Joseph Campbell's hero's journey.

&gt; [The creator of *Journey*] discussed looking for a central musical idea that would span the entire game, which ultimately took the form of the score's first track, ""Nascence,"" recorded in April 2009. 

&gt; Wintory credited the inspiration of hearing [his boss] discuss the project for how quickly the first musical ideas clicked in his mind. According to Wintory, the primalness of Thatgamecompany's games, **which are heavily influenced by Joseph Campbell's hero's journey, appeal to a broad audience through the story of mankind, rather than a more esoteric story**. 

&gt; He did not consider the abstract storytelling of *Journey* as more or less difficult to score than other projects, only ""different"". He also described the experience of scoring in an abstract, parallel way as taken to a new level by *Journey*.

Wintory, who has since scored early 50 feature films, is a rising star in the film composing industry. (You can read more about his track record, and many accolades, [here](https://www.austinwintory.com/about).) 

With John Williams [retiring from *Star Wars* for good after composing the score for IX](https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/03/john-williams-to-retire-from-star-wars-films-following-episode-ix/), and with countless new *Star Wars* film and TV pieces on the horizon, I feel that Wintory would be a prime candidate to succeed Williams in that area. 

Likewise, Wintory's music, due to the above, also fits in a way that others don't due to writing music in a style that matches Williams's. To quote a previous Redditor: 

&gt; I've said it before, and I'll say it again: While [Alexandre] Desplat is a great film composer, he has not shown that he can write in the Straussian-Korngold style that Williams is famous for. Example: the *Harry Potter* movies. Desplat does very little with leitmotifs, in fact he uses his own theme for Lily Potter as a generic theme for the movie, not as a specific idea.

&gt; My pick for a composer to take over the *Star Wars* Episode helm is Michael Giacchino or John Powell, who have proven they can write the Germanic music that actually suits the franchise. [(Source)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/48s1rn/if_and_when_john_williams_passes_away_michael/)

To this end, I think that Lucasfilm should definitely consider hiring Wintory in the near future. Even if not as Williams's direct successor for films, as a composer for other *Star Wars* shows and works.

More seasoned composer Michael Giacchino, who scored *Rogue One* and *John Carter*, among many other films, could also be a potential pick to be William's successor. 

Wintory has primarily scored various video games, it seems, whereas Giacchino, who also started by scoring video games, has a much more established track record. 

(Wintory is currently in the position that Giacchino was in, before Giacchino was ""discovered"" by J.J. Abrams.)

&gt; Michael Giacchino is an American composer of music for films, television and video games. He composed the scores to the television series *Lost*, *Alias* and *Fringe*, the video game series *Medal of Honor* and *Call of Duty*, and many films such as *The Incredibles*, *Mission: Impossible III*, *Ratatouille*, *Star Trek*, *Up*, *Super 8*, *Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol*, *Star Trek Into Darkness*, *Dawn of the Planet of the Apes*, *Jurassic World*, *Inside Out*, *Zootopia*, *Star Trek Beyond*, *Doctor Strange*, *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story*, *Spider-Man: Homecoming*, *War for the Planet of the Apes*, *Coco*, and *The Incredibles 2*.

&gt; Giacchino has received an Emmy Award and multiple Grammy Awards, as well as a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for his work on *Up!*.

&gt; [...] When Giacchino's internship ended, Universal hired him, giving him a job upon graduation from college. He later moved to Disney, and when Disney relocated to Los Angeles, Giacchino moved with them, working in publicity, while taking night classes in instrumentation and orchestration at UCLA. His work for Disney had him interacting with the various personnel who worked in films, such as the producers who hired composers...

&gt; Giacchino's work on various video games led to his entrance into television.

&gt; In 2001, **J. J. Abrams**, producer of the television series *Alias*, discovered Giacchino through his video game work and asked him to provide the new show's soundtrack. The soundtrack featured a mix of full orchestral pieces frequently intermingled with upbeat electronic music, a departure from much of his previous work. 

&gt; Giacchino would go on to provide the score for J.J. Abrams's 2004 television series *Lost*, creating an acclaimed score which employed a unique process of using spare pieces of a plane fuselage for percussion parts. The score for Lost is also notable for a signature thematic motif: a brass fall-off at the end of certain themes.

&gt; Just like his counterpart, Stu Phillips, he worked with the television show creator Abrams on his shows with his music scores, while Abrams supplied the show's main themes on certain series ,such as *Alias*.

The Last Jedi in retrospect,"I originally posted this in r/truefilm but thought you guys might have more to add:

Upon my first viewing of *The Last Jedi* back in December, I admittedly disliked the film on many levels. In hindsight, the humor that Rian Johnson injected into this entry definitely took me off guard, as I wanted the overall tone and message of the film to be darker. Like many others during that first week of release, I pored over reviews and discussion boards looking for someone to make sense of what we got in the movie. It wasn’t until eight months later that I came upon a podcast (/Filmcast, which is excellent) that analyzed several thematic aspects of the movie I did consider a priority: Not being a hero, non-violent confrontation, and the Force not being exclusive to just one, royal bloodline. I’m actually bummed that I consumed *The Last Jedi* at face value because after listening to the /Filmcast and re-watching the film this week, I am 100% supportive of what Johnson did with his entry.

Many online reviews pointed out that there was an undercurrent of liberal politics guiding a handful of character actions (namely Rose’s anti-capitalist, “save what we love” attitude) and at the time, I bought into that criticism. In fact, the “Save what we love” scene is what completely killed the movie for me initially. Johnson actually went on the /Filmcast to discuss his decisions in detail and after hearing his reasons, I actually kind of get where he’s coming from now. Poe really needed to learn to reign in his trigger-happy, flyboy persona in order to preserve what was left of the Resistance in the face of annihilation. Finn needed to be shown by Rose and DJ that the struggles of the galaxy are not as black and white as Rebels versus the Empire, that there are many layers of conflict involving war profiteering and child slavery (which can be applied to our own world). Rey needed to be told she wasn’t from a special bloodline in order to illustrate that even the most seemingly insignificant individual can answer the hero’s call if they choose to. And Luke had to end the cycle of violence being perpetuated by the First Order and Kylo by taking a sacrificial, non-violent stance.

Another major complaint I had, again like many others, was the killing of Snoke with no explanation of his background. The /Filmcast made an excellent point about Snoke’s disposal in its relation to Episode IX; Because he is no longer the main threat, and Kylo is more or less on the fence of turning to the light, we really don’t know what direction the final film will take. As satisfying as it would have been to learn of Snoke’s motivations or who his master was, his death in the second act of the trilogy makes the final conflict of Episode IX even more mysterious. Will it be Rey attempting to turn Kylo or vice versa? With Luke and Snoke removed from the picture, I admit I am eagerly anticipating how they will close out the sequel trilogy.

Considering the derivative story JJ Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan cooked up for the *The Force Awakens*, I now understand and appreciate the deviance of Johnson’s story, which is desperately needed in order for this franchise to grow. Johnson also mentioned in the podcast interview that he wanted to make a film that would not only connect with older audiences, but also capture the hearts and minds of younger audience members, just as the original trilogy did with him. This notion struck a chord because I remember watching movies like *Star Wars* when I was younger and just being totally captivated by those universes. His comment reminded me that these movies aren’t just for the original or prequel trilogy fans who are now adults, but also for the next generation of young filmgoers who will perceive the movies differently. By taking the grand narrative into an unexpected direction while simultaneously crafting it to inspire children, I now feel Johnson achieved the Episode VIII audiences may not have wanted but what the series absolutely needed.",StarWars,True,1534193470,2018-08-13

The Grysk feel more like the Vagaari than the Vong to me,"The use of stealth technology and interdiction technology is a lot more like the Vagaari.

Them being a known threat that the Chiss are fighting and a threat that could be a threat to the Empire. They are nomadic like the Vagaari (the Vong aren't really nomadic so much as invading).

Their physical stature is more like the Vong and they are more up for fighting like the vong were and even use at least one example of biotechnology in their bug weapons.

They do have a bit in common with the vong but overall they just feel to me more like the Vagaari. And the Vagaari were Zhan's creation while the Vong were not (he had a different idea about what the threat was.) so it feels like he's pulling more from his previous creation.",StarWars,True,1534259314,2018-08-14

Why I think Episode IX will be a box office bomb,"It's hard to imagine this day would come, but I feel that the final major Star Wars installment will be a huge box office disappointment.

One of the main reasons is **fan backlash**. Most fans dislike The Last Jedi, which in my opinion is the worst of all SW movies. It destroyed the entire legacy of the original trilogy and turned our beloved hero Luke Skywalker into a coward who tries to kill his nephew. The disrespectful nature of this movie left the fanbase displeased, however, Disney and Rian Johnson chose to ignore the very existence of this backlash and pretended any criticism of movies was invalid. I'm not saying all actions of the fanbase are correct (the harassment of Kelly Mary Tran because of Rose is unacceptable, it's not her fault that her character is bad), but it's untruthful to say everybody who disliked TLJ doesn't have good reasons for it.

However, when Solo was released, Disney had to understand they couldn't keep ignoring the fans. It was a commercial failure, and it was really obvious it was coming: the trailers didn't have many views on YouTube and you couldn't find anyone interested in a movie nobody asked for. A large group of fans also decided to boycott it because of Disney's mistreatment of the franchise. Disney lost a lot of money with this movie, and it's now clear that the ""Star Wars"" brand was heavily damaged by The Last Jedi. It doesn't take people to movie theaters anymore.

Furthermore, while Disney **relied too much on nostalgia to make The Force Awakens a success, it's not possible anymore**. Han Solo is dead. Luke Skywalker was assassinated by Rian Johnson, both figuratively and literally. And with the passing of Carrie Fisher, we know that Leia will only have a minor role in IX. Before the new movies, many people had high hopes to see the OT heroes again. But Disney made them fail at everything. Their struggle was useless and they never saw the Galaxy in peace. The new Republic doesn't exist anymore, the Empire still rules the Galaxy, Leia and Han didn't become a happy couple, Luke didn't train a new generation of Jedi and the trio never meets again. With the demolishing of their legacy by the new movies, fans of the original trilogy have no reason to spend money to watch Episode IX.

They could compensate that with good new characters, but they didn't: **the new characters are uninteresting and unlikeable**. Rose is a very weak character (once again, not because of the actor) that has no reason to exist, even Jar Jar Binks contributed more to the plot than her. Nobody really cares about Finn or Poe, they will never be as iconic as Han Solo or Lando. Rey is a worse protagonist than Luke or Anakin — in the OT and the prequels the characters were relatable because they had flaws, that's why Luke and Anakin lost their first battles. However, in the sequels, Rey never fails and manages to do anything with no training at all. She beats a trained force user the first time she holds a lightsaber and in the same week, after barely training for some days, she was able to kill several trained guards who protect the most powerful man in the Galaxy. Younger audiences don't like them, you don't see kids nowadays dressing up as Kylo Ren or Rey.

And I'm yet to see someone who finished watching The Last Jedi and thought ""wow, I'm so excited to see what happens next"". There's really **nothing left to tell*. After fans' expectations for a good movie were subverted with a terrible one in the last year, basically all the plot threads from The Force Awakens don't matter anymore. Rey's parents? They are nobody. Snoke? He's dead, he doesn't matter anymore. Luke Skywalker? He became a hermit and is also dead. So, what's left for Episode IX? I don't see anything interesting that could be told in the movie. It will be a very predictable film that everyone knows how it's going to end. Rey just needs to defeat Kylo Ren and Poe/Finn/Rose will be involved in another useless filler subplot like Canto Bight. There will be no surprises here, and no incentive to go watch it.

And for these reasons, we can conclude that **Star Wars is a dead franchise**. There was a time when people would be hyped for the next movie. But after the last ones, as demonstrated with the flop of Solo and the underperformance of The Last Jedi, people are done with it. Disney was able to lose the old fans and fail to make new ones. The franchise became irrelevant among younger people: kids are oblivious to Star Wars and don't really care about it. Just look at how SW toy sales decreased since Disney bought Lucasfilm. The newer generations love Marvel heroes like the Avengers, Black Panther and Spider Man. They aren't interested in Rey, Finn, Poe and Rose. Episode IX will face great competition in December 2019, because other companies learned Star Wars no longer has the impact it used to have and are comfortable releasing other films next to it. And if you ask me, I'd say there will be greater interest in Jumanji 3 and Masters of the Universe than Episode IX, a movie written by the same guy who wrote Justice League.",StarWars,True,1533060145,2018-07-31

The Last Jedi’s Secret Character: Han Solo,"“Where’s Han!?” asks Luke in a worrisome voice early in the film and maybe in a comment when the first teaser was shown.

Obviously Han Solo is not physically in the movie but even on my first watch I could feel his presence all throughout the film. Just out of arms reach but always there. The impact he has left will always be there.

Han is mentioned several times throughout the film by several characters. Usually to mention his passing or for more thematic purposes. He is mentioned the most around Ben Solo as we see him haunted by his father or rather the fear that he will become him.

“You have your father’s heart!” says Snoke trying to provoke Ben in an early scene.

“I Killed Han Solo!” Ben proclaims, clearly still having his father’s death eat away at him. But we see throughout the film that his father is still very much with him eating the darkness that is in his heart away.

“Strike me down, and I’ll always be with you, just like your father.""

And if I’m reading the film correctly, the golden dice represent Han and the the goodness that was in his heart along with it. Luke gives the dice to Leia just before he says his goodbyes. A reunion of our iconic trio happened after all.

I doubt we will ever see Harrison Ford as Han Solo given how he personally feels about the character and the franchise as a whole. Even though Han Solo may be gone his legacy and aura will last forever and will always be felt.

Han Solo's life, now seeing it in full makes him all the more tragic when you think about it.

Why does everyone hate TLJ?,"I’m sure that this has been asked before or even posted several times with many different iterations of the same premise. Although, upon rewatching The Last Jedi I didn’t hate it. I actually liked the movie quite a bit. I surprised myself with that idea but I believe it has some merit. 

I’d like to go over what others consider the flaws (not including examples from critics or specific posts just what I’ve heard and read online). I’m looking for a discussion so we can articulately go over what makes TLJ such a bad movie. 

I believe that Finn had the potential to be a great character and TLJ ruined that for me. The lack of character depth is appalling. I still don’t understand why he chose to stand down in TFA if there’s no clear connection to the force there. I fully expected Finn to develop into a force sensitive character and stand by Rey. I understand that that puts some sort of imbalance amongst the force but didn’t we get past all that BS after the end of Return of The Jedi? It’s not anyone else’s job to bring balance so what’s the point of restricting force capable characters to just Rey, Kylo, Luke, Snoke and .... Leia?? 

As for merits TLJ had a lot going for it. Riding one of the largest opening weekends of all time as well as a whole generation of fans joining in on the fun it looked as if it would be another great movie, perhaps almost as good as Empire. Without a doubt it is not as good as that masterpiece. Although, I find that I like many aspects of the movie. From the multiple settings to an entirely new plot line (not rehashed like TFA), TLJ gave its all for creating a movie that steered Star Wars in a new direction. To be honest I greatly enjoy the idea that there is new content and we won’t be dealing with a Death Star 4.0 in IX. What is to come? The set up for TLJ was great, there’s no more Luke, Leia is now a force user, Rey and Kylo have found their stride and are two sides of the same veritable force coin. From the intense psychic connection between Rey and Kylo to the profound realization that love has to win (from everyone’s favorite character Rose), to Admiral Holdo’s valiant, albeit ridiculous, sacrifice I felt that TLJ makes a strong case for a pretty damn good movie. 

So please, if you guys could explain to me what about it you hate so much, I would greatly appreciate it. ",StarWars,True,1533075284,2018-07-31

Luke Skywalker's heart got microwaved.,"So, if you're like me and you really hate the fact this iconic character died simply because 'projecting holograms is hard, ya'll,' I thought I'd present an alternate theory in how to make this just a little bit less stupid.

Earlier in the movie, when Rei and Kylo are communicating, we see Kylo alone after the communication is broken; with some physical drips of water on him.  Which means while an image, physical matter did in fact transfer across it.

Fast forward to Luke Skywalker getting a ton of lasers blasted through him and then a light saber stuck in his heart and twisted around for a moment.  Why would rain drops transfer, and not highly intense burning heat?  Well, I have no reason for that, which leads me to the title theory.

Luke's heart got cooked by a light saber over the image link in the same way the water drops transmitted through it.  Perhaps his final thought was ""oops.""",StarWars,True,1533086973,2018-07-31

Good luck to the cast &amp; crew of IX,"Lately I've been combing through all Star Wars related subs and have seen so much toxicity and hate everywhere. While I did have some issues with TLJ, I don't hate it and have not lost hope for the ST or Star Wars in general. Obviously as my username implies I'm a fan of JJ Abrams and I am SO glad he's on board. TFA did have some ANH parallels but overall the movie was done well, the casting is amazing and the character development made me care about all of them. My biggest qualm with TLJ was the lack of character development to the point that I stopped caring for some of the characters (like Finn or even Poe), starting disliking some of the characters (Maz) and did not entirely enjoy the new characters they introduced (Holdo, Rose). I was even indifferent about Rey, Kylo and Luke and actually annoyed with Leia at times. I like TLJ enough but I have hope that IX will bring it home. 

So without further ado, I wish JJ Abrams &amp; co all the luck in the world. I'd say break a leg but considering what happened to Ford, I'm going with may the force be with you.

Some thoughts on the Sequels,"Okay, I stand a pretty good chance of pissing a few people off, but this is just my opinion, and I kinda just wanted to get some thoughts from you all. Am I crazy to think that eventually, the perception of The Last Jedi will change? Even the whole sequel endeavour as a whole?  I understand that even suggesting that will make some of you cringe but hear me out. I'm not trying to incite an argument, it's really more like I'm taking people's thoughts in? Either way, moving on.

If I've learned something from the prequels, it's that time heals all wounds, even the fanboy ones (yes, mine included). I feel like in time people will look back on the sequel trilogy and the Rogue Ones and the Solos, glad that they happened, or at least I hope so? If you're of the mind that, ""even time won't turn me around on this franchise"" I totally understand that. I'm not trying to tell you that you should think different. 

Do I wish people that had negative experiences, had positive ones instead? Of course. I wish everyone got the movie they wanted, but realistically that won't ever happen. People will always have a difference of opinions, and I've learned to embrace that. I just think that with time, and removing ourselves from the moment, we (the star wars community) might gain a different perspective on the current ""era"" of Star Wars we find ourselves in.

Now I'm not saying you should put your rose coloured glasses on, and lie to yourself that it's all been perfect. To be totally honest, I'm not madly in love every Star Wars film to have ever have come out, and I recognize the flaws in the ones I do enjoy. There were ups and downs, and there's probably going to be quite a few more. However, given some time I think people will generally look back on all this glad that it happened. But that's just an opinion, I'd love to hear yours, no matter where you stand in the conversation.",StarWars,True,1533096658,2018-08-01
Let's delve into some of our favorite aspects from Star Wars(Besides other things),[removed],StarWars,True,1533096707,2018-08-01
To Lucas arts and Disney....,"Stop listening to the OT fanboys. All that I see and hear is how the new movies are trash and will never be as good as the originals and all that hooplah, and I'm pretty tired of the fact that it seems like execs are starting to give in. The sequel trilogy, and the spin offs have been fantastic. Perfect?  Not by any means, but they've been incredible movies. All of them. Even TFA, which is literally a new hope 2.0. But I think that's part of the problem. TFA is considered by most it seems the best of the Disney era simply becauSe it's familiar and did nothing to challenge the viewer. TLJ however, did. And it needed to. People complain about the portrayal of Luke, the use of the force by Leia, the death of snoke , etc. But those aren't valid criticisms. Like, Luke had ALWAYS been a flawed character, that's what makes him so great!  He was a whiny kid on tatooine, his sexual attraction towards Leia drove him to be impulsive in the entirety of a new hope. We saw this impulsiveness again in empire, though for better reasons. He acted on anger and emotion to be able to beat Vader in Jedi. So why WOULDN'T he act on instinct seeing his nephew threatening everything his life was devoted to?  Why WOULDN'T he be a grumpy, whiny old man and refuse to jump back into something that has caused him so much pain?  Rian Johnson gave Luke the perfect story arc for his character, AND gave him the utterly badass exit he deserved!  There is no reason for anybody to complain about Luke, other than pure resentment for anything new. Leia using the force made total sense. Admittedly, I think it VISUALLY was unappealing, but considering she was using the force, despite not knowing it, in empire and Jedi, again, no reason people should complain about that part of it. Now to snoke. THE PALPATINE HAD LITERALLY NO BACKSTORY IN THE OT, WE DIDNT EVEN KNOW HIS NAME UNTIL THE PREQUELS, WHY DOES SNOKE NEED TO HAVE SOME ELABORATE BACKSTORY?! I enjoy theorizing, I enjoy have expectations going into a move on what I think will happen, but more so, I enjoy those expectations being broken with twists far bigger than I could imagine. I sat in the theater literally saying ""no there's no way that's gonna happen"" when kylo was turning anakins lightsaber. For months after I first saw TLJ, my biggest issue was, why didn't holdo tell poe?  But now it makes sense. The first order tracked then through hyper space and getting their location in the first place. The resistance believed there was a spy on board, and considering poes behavior got most of the fleet killed, he was the first suspect. If poe knew, and was the spy, the first order would have known the plan from the beginning. This gives perfect cause for the rest of the movie to play out the way it did. That does bring me to a couple valid criticisms. Canto bight was too long. I get you wanted to send a real world message, but star wars isn't the place. We want an escape watching these movies, the placement of the animal cruelty message, as well as the way it was presented was just not good. Omitting that stuff cuts down the clunkiness of the scene without losing the plot importance. That was the biggest flaw with the movie. Behind that, the rose and Finn love story was too forced. There was no attachment until the kiss at the end, which was simply weird, awkward, and not needed. Tied into that, poe should have been the one to stop Finn. It would have made his character come full circle and TRULY learn from his mistakes earlier in the movie. It also eliminates the rose and Finn kiss. But as a whole, TLJ is my favorite movie. I don't think it's perfect, I don't think a prefect movie is possible, but TLJ challenged what I believed in terms of the story, presented me with twists I couldn't expect, and was the most fun I've ever had watching a movie for the first time. Honestly, I don't care what people say, all of the complaints I've seen are people whining that it's not the OT. And those people's opinions simply don't matter. If you can't accept change and complex story arcs, you don't get to criticize a story. That's why the critics have it such high ratings. They are trained to judge based on the things that I mentioned that are complex story arcs, like Luke. And as long as these movies continue to evolve and challenge us, true star wars fans will always support it. The past is the past. Appreciate it for what it was, but also move on and evolve. The Jedi couldn't do that and they're gone. If star wars doesn't evolve, it'll become nothing but constant rehashes, and nobody wants that. Moral of the story, stop listening to the idiots who aren't capable of accepting change, because the continuation of this franchise has been nothing less than spectacular",StarWars,True,1533096874,2018-08-01

Star Wars Debate between me and a friend while at work.. Who do you agree with?,"Rich   9:40 AM: 
did you see Billy D Williams is reprising his role as Lando in episode IX
Jason   9:41 AM: 
yep!
But, I guess they're gonna kill him off too
Rich   9:42 AM: 
well, not everyone dies of old age, snuggled in there bed you know.
Rich   9:43 AM: 
especially in a galaxy consumed by war
Rich   9:43 AM: 
is that how you want to go out? if you where in the star wars universe
Jason   9:45 AM: 
Not like a bitch having a feelings moment with my idiot emo son I wouldnt
Jason   9:45 AM: 
Taking on vader, or go one-on-one with a star destroyer
Rich   9:45 AM: 
your such a hater
Rich   9:46 AM: 
not everyone has a miraculous and heroic death you know.. It's just not realistic, If anything it makes the characters more relatable
Rich   9:49 AM: 
what if your child who you loved, turned there back on you and joined a street gang. So in an attempt to bring them home, you confront them only to get shot or stabbed and killed
Rich   9:49 AM: 
dying while trying to be a hero, in the sense of saving a loved one 
Rich   9:50 AM: 
extremely relatable situation
Jason   9:56 AM: 
Lame. Solo is the perpetual representation of the rogue in the SW universe. He archetype has bigger things to deal with than daddy issues
Rich   9:57 AM: 
did you even pay attention in the original trilogy 
Rich   9:58 AM: 
he puts up a tough front but you can see in his eyes, in his face he does care, he tries to bury it, to mask it. But in the end he truly is selfless
Rich   9:59 AM: 
Now belnicio del torro's character in the last jedi is the true representation of a rogue
Rich   10:00 AM: 
If Solo really was what you say he was. Than he would have made a deal with the empire when that tractor beam pulled the falcon into the deathstar. Just like belnicio's character did
Rich   10:07 AM: 
even Woody Haralson's character in the Solo movie was more Rogue than Solo 
Jason   10:13 AM: 
Dude, Solo is a thief and a criminal . 
Jason   10:14 AM: 
He's the equivalent of a trucker running drugs across the border who killed a guy at a truck stop, but, he's the archetype for the 'the rogue'
Benecio's character was completely pointless and unecessary
Rich   10:18 AM: 
A trucker running drugs through a third world country maybe. Killing another drug peddler who confronted him.. A thief and criminal with morals. He doesn't kill innocent people. 
Rich   10:21 AM: 
how was Benicio's character pointless? He was a scumbag they ran into in jail and asked for his help.. Just like obi-wan and luke ran into a scumbag in a cantina.. One just happened to have a lot less morals than the other... Just goes to show not everyone in this galaxy can be trusted
Rich   10:22 AM: 
+ his character will most likely return in IX
Rich   10:23 AM: 
i'm hoping he retains the tough rogue persona. and doesn't end up with a heart like Han proved in the end of episode IV and throughout the original trilogy
Jason   10:23 AM: 
""I know where we can go find a code breaker, he's in Casino Royale. Let's go, diversity hire!""
""Uh oh, we in prison now"" wamp wamp
""But look, we are in the SAME CELL as ANOTHER CODE BREAKER, WOW""
Purely dumb
Rich   10:25 AM: 
you really don't think there would be more than one code breaker in a CASINO.. where there are machines you could BREAK the CODE for and steal money.... yea way to far fetched *rolls eyes*
Jason   10:25 AM: 
possibly, but ENDING UP IN THE CELL WITH THE GUY??? dumb.
Rich   10:28 AM: 
people who break the law normally end up in jail.. and to reduce the staffing needed to patrol the cell block, putting a few criminals in the same cell enables them to just monitor one cell instead of three
Rich   10:28 AM: 
coincidence=force in Star Wars
Rich   10:29 AM: 
it is as the force wills it
Jason   10:29 AM: 
The original trilogy did NOT have anywhere near this level of guesswork or conjecture that you're trying to imply. It was a very straightforward good guys/bad guys with some eastern zen philosophy mixed in. If anything, the intelligence and attention span of the modern audience has gone down since the 70s/80s, so there's no way Disney would be trying to make them think this much about a throw away character
Rich   10:37 AM: 
awww, are the new movies making you think too hard
Jason   10:38 AM: 
No, if anything, they're just plain dumb. Poorly written, hack plot, that grade school kids wrote
Rich   10:39 AM: 
smh lol
Jason   10:40 AM: 
And FUEL!?!?!?!? Are you SERIOUS? THE STARSHIPS NOW RUN ON COMBUSTIBLE FUEL????? 
Rich   10:42 AM: 
what did you want them to run on? pixy dust and s**t?.. 
Jason   10:46 AM: 
Something beyond nuclear fission, at least. I mean hell, we have modern military ships that run on nuclear. But nope, our super fasts tar fighters run on good ol 97-grade gasoline. dumb
Jason   10:48 AM: 
could be a futuristic reactor of some kind. 
Rich   10:57 AM: 
there were multiple different fuel types in the star wars universe including a cruel oil type (not gasoline). ION drives is another, somethign with sublight engines, hyperspace generator from episode 1
Jason   11:01 AM: 
duh, TIE = twin ION engine
But, combustible engines for starships just doesn't work. the mass to weight ratio for thrust would never work. Hell, our modern 'spacecraft' use solid fuel, and that takes up the majority of the mass of the space ship. So to use liquid fuel in a starship, or even a starfighter,  would be completely ridiculous. Maybe banthas run on liquid fuel, but not anything else that would fly in space
Rich   11:23 AM: 
your limiting your mind, restricting yourself to what we know. As opposed to what we don't know.. Guaranteed we will discover a fuel capable of requiring small amounts for further distances and more power.. How many things that were once thought impossible, are now possible? 
Rich   11:24 AM: 
isn't that was sci-fi is all about? 
Rich   11:28 AM: 
for someone so into sci-fi and fantasy, you block your mind off to things that defy our known physics dude
Jason   11:30 AM: 
nope, not quite. Flip the script daddy-o
Rich   11:33 AM: 
you just said, ""combustible engines for starships just doesn't work. the mass to weight ratio for thrust would never work. ""... this statement proves your thinking impossible as opposed to maybe
Jason   11:35 AM: 
COMBUSTIBLE FUEL WON""T WORK FOR TRAVEL IN SPACE!!!!!
Jason   11:35 AM: 
Stop drinking the cool aid and sniffing the glue
Rich   11:37 AM: 
don't we use rockets in space?
Jason   11:37 AM: 
Let's entertain this insanity for a minute: imagine an A-Wing, going in to an intense turn, close to 90-degrees. What do you think happens to the balance and direction of the fighter when that liquid fuel starts sloshing around inside the tank.
Jason   11:39 AM: 
Also, most of our space craft (shuttles) use small amounts of fuel (usually solid state oxygen mix) for minor course corrections, then don't rocket around with thrusters burning the entire time. BECAUSE: there's not enough frikkin space on the shuttle carry enough fuel for full intense space battles.  They use escape velocity and gravity 
Jason   11:45 AM: 
before we end up hating each other and I just can't talk to you anymore: How about hanging out Friday night?
Rich   11:56 AM: 
lol, let me see what the weekend plans are
Jason   12:02 PM:

Does no one care about Solo?,"I don't mean this to say the movie is bad but now that spoilers are freely upon us i realized how little it ever gets brought up.  Like rogue one will occasionally still get a conversation going with like 5k upvotes but i never seem to see anything about solo even in comments.

Obviously it did very poorly at the box office but i figured it would be discussed at least a little bit in here. I don't even see anybody talk negatively about it.

I wonder if part of the reason Lucas sold Star Wars to disney was revenge against the fans for all the hate he got for the prequels?,"He knew they were going to take his creation and bleed it dry with two films a year for the rest of time until no one can even stomach seeing a title crawl anymore. I think selling was about more than just the money for him.

He gets to sit back in smug satisfaction for the rest of his life saying ""You thought the prequels were bad? Enjoy the sequel to the Bobba Fett prequel no one wanted"". 

Say what you want about Lucas, but he dreamt up something amazing, and with a lot of help from equally passionate people, created something many of us can say we legitimately love. Or loved, rather.  

To turn that spark of creation over to a corporation he clearly knew would exploit the franchise to its furthest limits takes more than just greed for the money he was offered. It takes hate.

Lucas either hates us, or he hates Star Wars for consuming his life, but he fell to the dark side and sold his baby to a company based around exploiting childrens fantasies for cash. He knew what was coming, and I think he thinks we deserve it.",StarWars,True,1533145319,2018-08-01
How Big of a Factor Was Maul’s Positive Reception in Solo in Disney’s Decision to Complete The Clone Wars?,"I believe it was the most talked about piece of the film, and showed Lucasfilm that even if there isn’t enough interest to make a Solo 2, there is still a large enough portion of the audience who is paying attention to the stories told by Filoni on the small screen, and who care about those characters. There were actually quite a lot of TCW + Rebels references.

So what do you think?",StarWars,True,1533145988,2018-08-01

Evolution of the Star Wars Films,"In the prequels the jedi are the aggressors, in the OT luke learns to not be the aggressor and defeats the sith, in the ST the new characters are trying to learn to not be the aggressors. The way Star Wars is evolving has kept things so fresh for me personally. TFA was a thesis film, saying we should make Star Wars films just like we used to, and TLJ was the anti thesis film, let the past die kill it. IX will be a perfect synthesis of old and new. I have faith in JJ. Now story aside the evolution of special effects in Star Wars has been stellar. All these nitpicky assholes saying the throne room fight scene was poorly choreographed, look at the first ever lightsaber fight between luke and vader, it is unbelievably boring by todays standards. The prequels lightsaber fights have been memed to no end. The sound effects have gotten so much better too.

C. Holdo knew they were all dead anyway, this move will cripple the resistance, who no longer have a main flagship. But at least they didnt get completely destroyed. Holdo always had the intention of suicide, hence why no telling poe her plan.

Jedi generations??,"So here's a question that was bothering me today. But let me step back for a second: when you have an animal with characteristics that you want to see, you mate it with another that has similar traits that you want to see produced in an offspring, ideally better or stronger.  But the Jedi refuse relationships or emotional attachments, so how do they ensure future generations of Jedi? Where do all the Younglings come from? Presuming force sensitivity is still a genetic trait, like the whole midiclorian thing, did they have a breeding program to ensure strength? Or did they just count on the universe randomly repopulating it in children in the Galaxy?

Why a Kenobi spin off movie would be great for Star Wars,"A Kenobi movie would be a lot different from the Solo movie in a lot of ways.


Solo was only a major part of the OT, which everyone has seen and is the one most remember the most. Kenobi was another piece of the OT, not as big of a piece though because of his diminished role after he dies in his final duel with Vader. Kenobi is also unquestionably the most liked character from the prequels, and I don't think it's really too close. Sure, people like Mace and Yoda as well, but Kenobi is the one that most prequelmemers tend to care about most. *Back to the point*: A Kenobi movie will be the only spinoff movie that will be targeted to the fans from two different trilogies. Since the prequels aren't too old, and the sequel trilogy isn't even completed yet, we can guesstimate that this is about 65-80% of the fanbase. Yes, a great majority of Star Wars fans like the OT the best, but the Solo movie didn't add too much to what the mainstream fans already knew about Han.


Another reason to make this movie is that there hasn't been a movie that focuses on the immediate aftermath of RotS. The Kenobi movie would start right around there and really fill in some plot between the OT and prequels. Sure, there's the comics and books, but I dont have the time to read or the urge to want to read them. All I know about the in between is from the occasional post about Maul or Luke's childhood, nothing about what Kenobi was doing, or maybe the Empire having issues taking everything over (I doubt it though).


Yes, I understand that Rouge One (which had very little backstory and is based just before Episode IV even starts) and Solo are both in between Episodes III and IV, and that Solo does adventure into what the in between years were like, but they really are still OT spinoffs. The Kenobi movie should be able to blend the trilogies together in a way that no other spinoff movie could (without having to character build the entire movie)


Between focusing on a time that really got skipped over completely and making it about a character that is universally enjoyed by all of the fan groups, I honestly don't see any way that this movie fails to draw a crowd before the actual making the movie part. Kenobi has played the second biggest role in all of the Star Wars films. He definitely deserves a movie that is focused on him.",StarWars,True,1533155539,2018-08-01
Would Attack of the Clones been a better film if Count Dooku was introduced in The Phantom Menace?,"I was debating this for a little bit on my drive home recently and it had me thinking.

So how do we feel about flashbacks in IX?,"I'm going to start with the most controversial thing I have to say:

I love TLJ, and it's my second favourite Star Wars movie.

That being said, I still wouldn't hate to see some things that others have suggested they would have preferred in VIII, mostly more badass Luke.

I know that Luke is clearly dead, but how would all of you feel if we saw flashbacks of him kicking ass with his green lightsaber since it can't happen for real now? 

If you had a problem with that in TLJ, would a flashback remedy that at all? Would you rather them focus on looking forward instead of spending too much time looking back? 

Other than the brief flashbacks in TLJ, flashbacks have never really been a big thing in Star Wars. I was wondering how they might be received?",StarWars,True,1533159403,2018-08-01
Some interesting thoughts about Biggs and the Rebellion,"In the original Star Wars, we only know Biggs through Luke's excitement at ""reuniting"" with him. It was until years later that we saw a deleted scene that occurs around the time Vader is interrogating Captain Antilles in which Biggs confides in Luke that he's going to jump ship and join the Rebellion. The scene was confirmed to be canonical now.   


That makes Biggs' story a really interesting one. He trained at the Imperial Academy with the intention of jumping ship after basically using the Empire to train him in combat piloting. Given the timing of his visit with Luke, it could be that the events of Scarif really pushed him to make the jump right then. Though the Empire surely tried to cover up the events at Scarif (an embarrassment), rumors get around fast. Word probably got around that the various rag-tag rebel factions had finally teamed up in a big push against the Empire. Biggs likely felt emboldened, and made his choice.  


After he leaves Luke though, he must have found a Rebellion in panicked disarray. Though Scarif had been a victory, it was a pyrrhic one. Large amounts of their fleet was lost, Blue Squadron decimated, Raddus and his capital ship captured and presumed dead, and the plans they'd worked so hard for were missing, along with the daughter of a not-yet-outed sitting Senator. It must have been a mess, and I'd actually have loved to see what it was like for Biggs joining up in that moment. Even if it wasn't his first time making contact with the Rebellion, the events of Rogue One almost completely took place while he was on Tatooine, or at lease en route. Maybe he was even sent there to spread the word and recruit new potential insurgents.   


Then, he gets his chance to fly what was very likely his first mission with the Rebellion. And what does he get to do to get his feet wet? Fly against a moon-sized space station with a small group of star-fighters. He acted confident, but what must have been going through his head? Here he is with his childhood best friend, who he only days ago failed to convince to leave his farm back home, going up against the greatest threat the galaxy has ever seen. And on his first mission out, Biggs loses his life as a hero of the Rebellion.   


Looking at things from his point of view, I really want to see a book or comic about him. Sounds like a great story :D",StarWars,True,1533159558,2018-08-01
How to Dive Into the Star Wars Expanded Universe (aka Star Wars Legends),"Have you ever wanted to really dive into the old Star Wars books and comics that are now branded as Legends? If so, I'm going to share the method I've been using to read as much Expanded Universe material as possible (within reason).

WARNING: I do not recommend this method if you're just starting out. If you've never read any Star Wars books or comics, I recommend just experimenting and reading a few books that seem interesting to you. You can also search lists of recommended Star Wars books.

But if you think you're ready to really dive into the EU, then here's the method I've been using that's worked pretty well so far:

1) Reading the Adult Novels in Release Order:

These books are my primary interest when it comes to the EU. I started with Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn (since many people feel that was the beginning of the modern EU), and I've been reading the adult novels in order of release since then. The reason for release order is because I feel that it's more natural, and it allows you to jump around between Star Wars time periods and not get bored by staying in one for too long. Here's a link to the list that I've been using:

[http://www.swbooks.net/timeline/novel-publishing.htm](http://www.swbooks.net/timeline/novel-publishing.htm)

2) The Rule of 50

However, for the sake of time (and my sanity) I don't read books that I don't enjoy. I read at leas the first 50 pages to give the book a chance, but if I just don't like it then I move on to the next one. I still read a summary of the books I skip on Wookieepedia or in The Essential Reader's Companion, though, just so I know what happens. 

3) Adding Other Books &amp; Comics

If a novel I'm reading has an ad for something else (i.e. young adult book, comic, video game, etc) or if the story references it then I add it to my overall reading list (which is in release order) and I can go back to read that stuff if I want. So this way I keep my main focus on adult novels, but I read some other good material too.

This method has allowed me to read most of the old Star Wars books, but also to read other stories and to save time. Of course, this is just my method, and it may not work for you. If you want to branch out to Star Wars material not encompassed by my method, that's perfectly fine. I do the same thing sometimes. Like I said, read what sounds interesting to you if you're just starting out, and you may find your own method of diving into the rest of the EU.

If you're a fan of the Expanded Universe, is there a certain order that you used? What do you think of my method? Let me know down in the comments.",StarWars,True,1533160767,2018-08-01

Pitch for an Animated “Tales”- Style Anthology Show,"One of my favorite things about Star Wars is the sheer amount of interesting background characters nestled in each scene, and the fact that most of these characters have deep and detailed lore attributed to them. So when I learned about the Tales series of books, I ate them up learning about all of the different characters. When the EU was phased out in favor of Legends, it was disappointing to see these not become canon anymore (although they are still canon to me if they don’t contradict anything directly). I thought it would be great to have these brought back into canon through an anthology style show in the vein of Clone Wars. The great thing about this could be the sheer amount of genres that could be covered in these stories. From the horror of Dannie Jerriko’s brain eating to the solemn tale of Hammerhead, there is so much versatility held within. In my opinion, they could adapt the original Tales books but also they could create new stories exploring these characters as well.

Is the overall theme of the sequel trilogy legacy?,"If the prequels are ""**Rise**"" (both of Vader and the Empire) and the originals are ""**Fall**"" (again of Vader and the Empire), then I think the sequels are ""**Legacy**"".

We have the Resistance, an organisation built to specifically carry on the legacy and work of the Rebel Alliance. 

Just as the First Order is designed to carry on the legacy of the Empire.

Snoke seemed like he wanted to continue the legacy of the Emperor/the Sith, going so far as the groom a new Vader.

Kylo Ren of course was obsessed with the legacy of Vader, at least until TLJ. But even then it can be argued he still seems hung up on the past (despite his ""Let the past die"" mantra).

Rey tries to carry on the legacy of Luke Skywalker, even trying to recreate his saving of Vader with Kylo.

The Last Jedi as a movie grapples with the legacy of the Jedi order, asking if they still have a place in thee galaxy.

I think it's fair to say that the overall theme of the new trilogy is legacy. Showing what the next generation thinks of what came before. What lessons they learned, what they took away from it all. 

And if IX really is going to be the end of the Skywalker saga, then I think that works really well as a complete story.

Different directors through a trilogy historically has resulted in the best Star Wars before the ST,"So many people claim that the sequel trilogy suffers because each movie has a different director and that having the same director would have made it better.  Of the two previous Star Wars trilogies though the one that had different directors is (almost if anyone disagrees) universally considered the better of the two.  Personally (and I know not everyone will agree with this) I'd also say that the better movies have come also when the director was not the writer.

What is different in the sequel trilogy is that there are different *writers*.  A lot of the time ""different directors"" is credited as ruining the story continuity of the ST when a director on his/her own can not do this, it's the responsibility of the writers.  It's just that in the case of the ST the directors are the writers also.

Personally I hope that Lucasfilm keeps to the ""different directors"" model while establishing a proper story group to oversee the films that require internal continuity (it seems at the moment the Lucasfilm storygroup only really oversees peripheral material to the movies).  Rogue One and Solo both had different writers to directors (Solo even ditched directors who didn't work with the writers) and there's no reason why the saga films shouldn't follow this model.  

My proposal: never give a director writing control and keep the list of directors ever expanding for new and interesting tones of Star Wars but keep intrinsically linked films to the same writing teams to maintain consistency of vision on the story side.

Thrawn/Chiss Conspiracy Theory [*SPOILERS* for Thrawn: Alliances],"Is it possible that Thrawn was lying about everything, and that the Chiss are planning to conquer the Empire? Consider the following reinterpretation of Thrawn: Alliances…

Then:

* Rather than the Grysks, it was the Chiss who were watching the Clone Wars and who showed the Separatists where to mine cortosis and how to infuse it into battle armor (like Thrawn’s).
* The Chiss sent Thrawn to investigate Duja’s interference in their arrangement with the Separatists, and this was when he encountered Anakin.
* Thrawn took advantage of his encounter with Anakin to learn about the Republic/Jedi and gain his trust by helping him rescue Padme. Thrawn’s seemingly genius deductions leading them to Mokivj were a front.
* Upon seeing that the Separatists were also using cortosis in clone armor, Thrawn deduced that the war was being orchestrated by Palpatine, that the Republic would be victorious, and that the Chiss were in alliance with the wrong side.
* After rescuing Padme, Thrawn sought to return to the Chiss with this information. However, once Thrawn calculated that by leaving he would lose Anakin’s and Padme’s trust, and considering the Chiss’ relationship with the Republic now to be more important in the long term, he decided to stay.
* At this point Thrawn needed to destroy the factory and the Separatists in it because (1) he could leave no trace of his involvement in the rescue mission, lest the Separatists think the Chiss betrayed them, (2) it was essential for the Chiss’ future relationship with the Republic that there be no evidence of the Chiss’ aid to the Separatists, and (3) it was no longer worth aiding the Separatists in a war they were bound to lose. So Thrawn fabricated his “mission” in order to remove the shield generator core (the Chiss are too advanced not to have such technology), predicting that the combined destruction of the battle and Anakin’s inevitable attempt to blow up the mine would destroy the factory.
* After the day was saved, Thrawn hinted to Anakin that Palpatine was behind the whole operation, and then left in time to get to a safe distance and out of sight before the cortosis mine exploded.

Now:

* The Chiss have conquered the Grysks and plan to conquer the Empire next.
* Seeking to deceive the Empire into a false alliance, as they had previously done with the Separatists, and remembering that Thrawn once planted the seeds of an alliance with the Republic from his prior dealings with Anakin and Padme, the Chiss plant Thrawn in the Outer Rim so that he may be discovered by the Empire and rise through its ranks.
* Thrawn recognizes that the Empire can be toppled, but he has no way to communicate that to the Chiss without jeopardizing the Emperor’s trust in him. To get around this, Thrawn sends Eli Vanto to the Chiss with that message (perhaps knowingly, perhaps not).
* After receiving the message, the Chiss begin preparations for their conquest of the Empire. To protect themselves from Imperial attack while remaining anonymous, the Chiss direct the conquered Grysks to fill the hyperspace lanes on the edge of the Unknown Regions with debris (e.g., moons) and cloaked gravity well projectors—they even lend their force-sensitive children to the Grysks to facilitate any hyperspace travel. Recognizing that their factory on Mokivj was not destroyed, the Chiss set up the Grysks manufacturing gravity well projectors infused with cortosis, just as they had done with the Separatists and their armor. 
* The Emperor senses a disturbance in the Force on the edge of the Unknown Regions and recognizes it as force-sensitive Chiss children. Suspicious of Thrawn’s loyalty, the Emperor sends him and Vader to investigate the disturbance. The Emperor directs Vader to “deal with” the disturbance, predicting that Vader will attempt to kill the children and that Thrawn’s reaction would indicate his loyalty.
* Thrawn and Vader go on their joint mission. Thrawn’s seemingly genius deductions leading them to Mokivj are a front.
* Thrawn and Vader encounter the Grysks and the Chiss children. Thrawn fabricates the narrative of the Grysks kidnapping the children, and leads Vader to believe that it is the Grysks (and not the Chiss) who kept an eye on the Clone Wars, supplied the Separatists with cortsis, sought to infiltrate the Republic, and are now manufacturing gravity well projectors and moving moons to fill the hyperspace lanes. (Ironically, it is actually the Chiss who are infiltrating the Empire, through Thrawn.)
* To follow through on his lie that the Grysks are a threat to the Empire, Thrawn orchestrates the “rescue” (i.e., capture) of the Chiss children and the destruction of multiple Grysk warships. To keep up the ruse Thrawn avoids encountering any Grysks himself, and immediately after the Chiss children are “rescued” Thrawn speaks to them privately to ensure their cooperation.
* Before destroying the Grysk command ship, Thrawn hails it and introduces himself with his Chiss name. This tips off the Chiss officers who are commanding the ship of Thrawn’s presence and plan, at which point they remain silent and abandon ship in their Chiss spacecraft to return to the Ascendancy.
* Vader confronts Thrawn about the Chiss spacecraft but Thrawn says Vader must be mistaken. Recognizing that Vader doesn’t believe him, Thrawn fabricates that the Chiss are in a civil war and that some Chiss dissidents must have joined the Grysks. Thrawn lies that he introduced himself with his full name in order to lead the Grysks to attack the Chiss, claiming that the Grysks attack the enemy that is closer to them. (Ironically, Thrawn is placing the Grysks closer to the front of Vader’s mind so that the Empire will be more concerned with the Grysks than the Chiss).
* Thrawn and Vader presumably return to Coruscant and inform the Emperor that they “rescued” the children and returned them to the Chiss. Surprised that Vader did not kill the force-sensitive children as he had done so many times before, the Emperor’s doubts about Vader’s usefulness grow, allowing Thrawn's ascendance within the Empire to continue.

Luke Skywalker: The inexplicable explained,"From *Fury* by Salman Rushdie (2001):

*""He'd even brought a carving knife upstairs and stood for a terrible, dumb minute over the body of his sleeping wife. What had happened was beyond reason. He needed to put an ocean, at least an ocean, between himself and what he had almost done.*

*As a matter of fact, there was a copywriter living in Professor Solanka's building. He wore red suspenders and Hathaway shirts and even smoked a pipe. He had introduced himself that very afternoon by the mailboxes in the vestibule, holding a set of rolled-up layouts. (What was it about Solanka's solitude, the professor silently asked himself, that apparently obliged his neighbours to disturb it?) ""Mark Skywalker, from the planet Tatooine.""*

*""Man,"" said the largest, most protective of the Praetorian guard, her lover, no doubt, and her peroxide-blond centurion, ""for an apostle of peace you sure are filled up with war.""*

*A knife held over the sleeping figures of your wife and child cannot be mentioned to anyone, much less explained. Such a knife represents a crime far worse than the substitution of a long-haired feline for a mewling babe. And Solanka had no answer to the hows and whys of this appalling, enigmatic event. *Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle towards my hand?* There he had simply been, like a guilty Macbeth, and the weapon too was simply there, impossible to wish away or to edit out of the image afterwards. That he had not plunged the knife into sleeping hearts did not make him innocent. To hold the knife so and to stand thus was more than enough. Guilty, guilty!...This knife was his story now, and he had come to America to write it. No! In despair, to *unwrite* it. He had flown to the land of self-creation, the home of Mark Skywalker the Jedi copywriter in red suspenders, the country whose paradigmatic modern fiction was the story of a man who remade himself - his past, his present, his shirts, even his name - for love; and here, in this place for whose narratives he was all but disconnected, he intended to attempt the first phase of such a restructuring, namely...the complete erasure, or ""master deletion"" of the old program...Nothing less than the unselfing of the self would do.*

*What was he doing standing over these two sleepers with a, with a, knife, he wasn't the sort of person who would do a thing like this, you read about those persons every day in the yellow press, coarse men and sly women who slaughtered their babies and ate their grandmothers, cold serial murderers and tormented paedophiles and unashamed and wicked stepfathers and dumb violent Neanderthal apes and all the world's ill-educated uncivilized brutes, and those were other persons entirely, no persons of that nature resided in this house, ergo he, Professor Malik Solanka formerly of King's College in the University of Cambridge, he of all people could not be in here in his drunken hand a savage instrument of death.*

*A universe of toys was in the pipeline, everything from soft stuffed dolls to life-size robots with voices and flashing lights, to say nothing of Halloween-special costumes. There were boxed games and jigsaw puzzles and nine kinds of spacecraft...*",StarWars,True,1533212454,2018-08-02

Qi'ra and Rey,"So I know lots of people have made theories about this already but here's mine.  I think Qi'ra could absolutely be Rey's mother.  Now hear me out.  She seemed a little younger or the same age as Han in Solo, so she would be close to the same age as him in TFA.  This would be an understandable age for Qi'ra to be and have a daughter rey's age.  She would have had Rey in her thirties.  However I don't think it was with Han.  I think it was with some nobody and Q'ira considered it a mistake.  I think that Qi'ra kept the Crimson Dawn syndicate on the down low so that they wouldn't attract the empire like the Hutts did.  I think Qi'ra ran into Rey's father later on and saw him beating her. So Qi'ra bought Rey back anonymously (Kylo said that her nobody parent sold her for drinking money) and she took Rey to Jakku until her days in Crimson Dawn were over.  I think there is absolutely a chance of her being in Episode 9 and this also explains why Han is so naturally a father figure to her: he sees Qi'ra in her.  Considering Lando will make an appearance in Episode 9, I think it would be a reasonable theory for Qi'ra to show up since those two know each other already.  This would also lead to Lando introducing Rey to her possible mother.  Idk that's just my theory ://",StarWars,True,1533232814,2018-08-02

A point from Rian Johnson from the TLJ bonus features about Rey’s parentage,"I can’t remember the exact quote, but Rian Johnson basically said this:

Parentage/lineage is an important part of the Star Wars universe, specifically in the original and sequel trilogies. In the original trilogy, Luke was just a guy on Tatooine who wanted to be part of something bigger. He just wanted to help the Rebellion and find meaning inside of a cause he had no ties to. In ESB, the hardest thing that Luke could have discovered is that he’s not totally disconnected from the war. He’s Darth Vader’s son, so his entire life is actually entangled within this conflict.

In the sequel trilogy, Rey is someone who is desperate to find out who her parents were, or where she came from, or why she’s stranded in Jakku. She wants to find meaning from her past, a direct connection to her. In TLJ, the hardest thing Rey could discover is that she’s not special, she’s not a Skywalker or descended from powerful Jedi or anyone else prestigious, she’s just a girl who was deserted on a planet.

I think this is an interesting parallel and gives meaning to why her parents were drunks who sold her. The twist wasn’t a “screw you, this is unexpected.” It’s an obstacle Rey has to overcome and come out the other side being better.",StarWars,True,1533236455,2018-08-02

Sith spirits are kinda like Horcrux from Harry Potter. Sith put their essence into dark artifacts to linger around after death.,"In Harry Potter, a Horcrux is a dark object that store a fragment of the soul to let the wizards cheat death.

In Star Wars, we see a lot of Sith artifacts that contain the essence of the Sith Lords even after their death.

In Star Wars Canon, the only time we see a Sith lord appear after death is Darth Bane on Moraband/Korriban. Yoda was on his quest to understand the Force after hearing Qui Gon's voice. The dark spirit of Darth Bane appeared in front of Yoda but Yoda told him that he was not real. The spirit got pulled back into the sarcophagus.

I think Pablo Hildago once tweeted out that the Darth Bane was just an illusion created by the Force Priestesses but he deleted it so we don't have enough evidence if it is an actual ghost or just an illusion.

Also in Rebels, there is a female voice from the Sith Holocron when Erza opened in on Malachor. So some part of a Sith can be stored in an object even after the death.

In Legends, Sith Lords came back as a ghost a lot of times but they are usually bound to an object or a place. Sith Lord Karness Muur created the Muur talisman that can turn most non-Force sensitive beings into mutant creatures called Rakghouls. After his death, Muur's mind was still inside the Talisman, seeking new Force users to take over their body. People who came into contact with the talisman usually got taken over by Karness Muur.

Since the Sith thrive on darkness and corruption, they can never become one with the Force and they cannot manifest themselves as ghosts after death like the Jedi. So they constantly seek power and immortality to live longer. The Sith probably put their energy/essence into a place or an object to cheat their death. The illusion of Darth Bane on Moraband that Yoda saw could be a fragment of Bane's dark side power that still lingers around his sarcophagus. The female voice that Erza heard from the Sith Holocron is probably some fragment of the original Sith Lord who created the holocron.",StarWars,True,1533237711,2018-08-02
Are Jawas just Ewoks who left Endor centuries before the OT?,"This is something I’ve wondered about for a long time, mostly because the “Eee-yah!”sound effect used for the Jawas in ANH was reused for the Ewoks in RotJ. But there are some other similarities as well, from their general shape and size to the sounds of their languages. 

In fact, when Threepio is trying to communicate with the Ewoks, he says “they’re using a very primitive dialect,” which clearly implies that the Ewok language is very similar to another language he knows.

In all canon sources, nobody knows what Jawas look like under their robes, but I believe that one book (it might have been *From a Certain Point of View*) said that they are furry and the robes are necessary to keep them cool.

My overall conclusion is that a group of Ewoks once left Endor (whether willingly or otherwise) and somehow ended up on Tatooine.",StarWars,True,1533239348,2018-08-02

Which of the movies stand out the most or initiates the most discussion?,"Personally, I believe of the 10 Star Wars films we've had so far. There are a few films that people have either talked about or will be talking about for a long time.

#1- Empire Strikes Back
(This one is pretty obvious, the legendary twist back in 1980 is still  a relevant topic of discussion today. It is widely considered the best of the Star Wars films and will still be remembered in the future)

#2 The Phantom Menace
(The poster boy of the prequels which started off the first new trilogy of Star Wars films. This movie generated a lot of controversy in its time and grounded the audience expectations of this franchise)

#3 The Last Jedi
(More recent, but this movie definitely stands out the most right now. Even after Solo was released, this movie generated such intense controversy that few films ever match. Even 8 months later, there is still active debate in every corner of the Star Wars and movie community)

#4 A New Hope 
(The one that started it all, most people look back on this film very fondly and the entire movie has been dissected and interpreted by frame number. This film will always stand out for starting the franchise, but I do not see as much active discussion as the previous 3)

#5 The Force Awakens
(Grossed the highest of any Star Wars movie and 3rd highest grossing of all time. Discussion wise is less controversial, and ever since TLJ people have largely ignored discussing TFA)

#6 Revenge of the Sith
(People thought this was the last Star Wars movie to ever be released. Has a bold plot and stands out among the prequel trilogy)

#7 Return of the Jedi

#8 Rogue One

#9 Attack of the Clones

#10 Solo

Luke not dying at the end could have worked...,"I truly felt this way after watching this alternate cut on Youtube...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8XE_8f49Qo

At the end of the film he could have finally realized his purpose, and he can either stay on Ach-To with no purpose, or finally leave and start a new Jedi order with Rey and others (how he leaves might be tricky though, maybe Rey would come back in IX)

Luke could have been alive in the flesh for all of IX, and could have chosen his death peacefully at the end of IX when the fight is finally all over! He could return to Ach-To, and we could have this same ending as the very last scene, AND THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF THE SKYWALKER SAGA! He could possibly also fade away while looking over the new Jedi temple set up by Rey after he's properly trained her in IX. Or you could just have him alive at the end of the saga, and have his death be in a book.

I just wish he would restore the order while alive with Rey. His old apprentice destroyed his order, and his new one rebuilds it with him. ",StarWars,True,1532214518,2018-07-21
"What is ""the Academy"" that Luke wants to join.","My first guess is that he's talking about the Imperial Academy.

I guess you could argue that he intends to jump ship at some point like Biggs, but in the deleted scene between Biggs and Luke, Biggs talks about the Academy as if it is separate from the Empire. Biggs says he isn't going to wait for the Empire to draft him, which is an odd thing to say if the Academy already an Imperial institution.",StarWars,True,1532216181,2018-07-21

"I really like how all of the darksiders and ""sith"" Luke and his jedi face in the post RotJ era all connect back to Palpatine in some way in Legends.","I really like how all of the darksiders and ""sith"" Luke and his jedi face in the post RotJ era all connect back to Palpatine in some way. I was thinking about this the other day when I was talking to someone and they were saying they liked Snoke because he isn't just another Sith and that their were to many Sith after RotJ. 

Well right now we know next to nothing about Snoke. We don't know what kind of darksider he is (is he like the sorcers of tund? a prophet of the dark side? A random dark jedi?) We don't know anything about his history or beliefes in the force to determine what makes him different than the Sith. And strangely to me just the simple fact that he isn't a Sith is enough for people who don't like legends sith even though he still serves the same purpose as the Darth Sidious or any other sith lord. 

I get that many people don't like the idea of a Sith surviving after RotJ because of the Prophecy of the Chosen One. A prophecy that wouldn't come into effect untill 1999. Also one that must not have been highly on Georges mind in 95 when he suggested to Tom Veitch that the main badguy of Dark Empire should be a reborn emperor instead of a guy running around in a suit pretending to be Darth Vader. 

Also their is the fact that none of the living ""Sith"" that Luke will face are really Sith at all or at least in two cases they are not of the group of sith descended from Bane's line (in fact Bane's holocron will even deny the leader of one group the title of Sith). Except for the spirit of Exar Kun (spirit not ghost because Sith cant make force ghosts and don't have the same powers as a force ghost)  All of these people are dark Jedi or inquisitors/hands that take on the title of the Sith.

And it just shows the taint that Palpatine had on the galaxy and the force. Years and years after his death the NR and the Jedi are having to deal with his agents who just don't realize or can't allow their self to realize that the battle has been lost. 

One of the very first enemies Luke faces after Endor (and one of the few things from the Marvel comics to hop over to post Zhan legends) is Lumiya/Shira Brie who was one of the Emperor's five hands (personal assassins trained in the dark side). After the emperors death she leads the Toff from one of the small local clusters of stars outside of the galaxy to invade and take out the Rebels. Many decades later she has given herself the title of Dark Lady of the Sith and turns Luke's nephew Jacen Solo to the dark side. But while she will call herself Sith she never really learned the ""secret handshake"" as Pablo once put it. 

After that we have Cronal/Blackhole who was a cultist belonging to the Prophets of the Dark Side. Not a sith but a group of people who worship them and the darkside its self. He was Director of Imperial Intelligence and another of the things to make the jump from the Marvel comics to greater Legends (though only in one great book by Stover)

Jumping forward to when Luke starts his academy we have the one and only ""Sith Lord"" that Luke and his students will face. Though the guy has been dead for 4000 years at this point and is only a spirit that had bound himself to a temple on Yavin. He is also the only one I would say isn't connected to Palpatine except that its Kyp's anger at the empire that opens himself up to Exar Kun's manipulations (also we are going to have another Kyp situation if Kylo survives EP 9).

After that it is inquisitor after inquisitor. Jerec and his seven dark jedi who want to find the valley of the jedi and who are beaten by Kyle Katarn. All former Jedi turned by Palpatine to work for him hunting down other force users. 

We have Brakiss a inquisitor who starts the Shadow Academy with the help of the Second Imperium (one of the minor Imperial remnant factions) who sought to train new darksiders and even tried to turn Lukes neice and nephew into darksdiers (and succeeded in turning one of their friends).

You have Roganda Ismaren another one of the Emperor's hands who has experiments done on her son to turn him into a great darkside warrior. 

Some of the darksiders are even some of Lukes failed students like Desann who became a dark jedi and would lead the Empire Reborn project or his own apprentice who would side with a cult of darksiders wanting to resurrect a sith lord. 

They all have connections back to Palpatine and the story of the OT in some way. But none of them are sith. 

It isn't untill we get to post NJO were we meet anyone who we could really call sith. 

The first are the Lost Tribe. A group of Sith who crash landed on a planet 5000 BBY and lived in isolation from the galaxy untill forty years after Endor. Stranded 4000 years before Bane they are definatly not his Sith. And they aren't totally like the Sith of other generations either after 5000 years of isolation and absorbing the local customs. But they are the first ones that can really be called Sith, just not the Sith the prophecy was talking about. 

The second group comes way way after Luke and will acctually be a problem for his and Leia's great great grand kids. But they have a tight connection to palpatine. Because the Leader of the group is a falled Jedi knight who survived the Purge and spent most of the century in cryo stasis. And while the holocrons of Bane, Revan, Nhilus, and Addenu all deny him status as a Sith he is one of the only two post RotJ groups to be a true Sith (and if the end of Legacy II is to be believed his groups destruction relegates the entire sith order to history. Though as they say, history has a way of continuing). 

I know I could have went into more detail but that would really be just retailing the plots of some really good games and books. But really the main point of this is that except for two groups their are no true sith after Palpatines death and everyone Luke's jedi fight is in some way connected to the Emperor and his story. 

I wonder going forward in the NEU if we will see luke having to deal with any surviving inquisitors (the Uprising mobile game shows some survived past the movies) and any of the darkside cults that show up in Aftermath. I also wonder if we will learn anything about Snoke's philoshophy that will make him distinct from just being another random darksider (who is totally not a sith even though he holds the same position in the story as Palpatine) ",StarWars,True,1532217281,2018-07-21

Why hasn't there been a TCW video game?,"I'll admit, I'm in no way a professional game dev nor an IP lawyer, but I was wondering whilst taking a shower ""why hasn't EA/LucasArts/whomever made a AAA blockbuster game for SW: The Clone Wars (TCW)"" I know there was one less-than-stellar game that had a poor reception critically and in sales, but the fan community, which EA has clearly paid some attention too on /r/StarWarsBattlefront , has been in massive support for Clone Wars content since the inception of Battlefront 2015. 

The Clone Wars development team has already produced concepts, art, and rigged HD assets for the series that have only gotten better with time, as seen in the trailer released a few days ago. My question is really “why hasn’t EA used what’s already there?”.  The series has fleshed out so many worlds and stories — revealing so many microcosmic stories that would provide the depth necessary for a game in its numerous arcs. Some of these stories are merely alluded to, seeing troopers arrive to the focus of the episode from a devastating battle, or the show following what is only a fraction of the battles it portrays while so many other stories surround it.


Just seems a bit odd that EA has an exclusive licence and releases a game every 2 years when there is such a wealth of material out there that the community would support and pay for. A lot of fans’ gripes with EA have to do with their drive for money. In this scenario, they wouldn’t even need much of an art department. It’s all there. ",StarWars,True,1532220857,2018-07-21

"From what I can tell, Kreia from KOTOR2 was ultimately wrong and a Sith, not a gray Jedi or something undefined.","First and foremost, Kreia is one of the most fascinating characters in all of the Star Wars mythos (whether Original or Disney EU). Her insight into the problems of the Jedi and Sith (and the galaxy at large) on both sides, and her personal struggles, are fascinating to me as one who can discuss the overall theology of spirituality and how it relates to the individual. However, I would argue she is not only wrong, but perhaps the most arrogant force-user in the entire series. 

For context, here's how I see the Jedi and Sith with a basic overview of their philosophies. The Jedi from the EU media believe in objective good and evil, and that good must triumph. The Sith don't believe in objective good or evil, just points of view (subjective standards), power, systems of oppression (apprentices to overthrow their masters, rather than the Jedi's method of growing and becoming peers with them), and individual wants with no ""true morality"" being considered.

Despite all of her criticisms of the Jedi and Sith, Kreia even parrots a few lines of philosophy from the Jedi and Sith where it fits her perspective, like the teachings of the old Jedi order on why there should be more separation of family from children:

&gt;""...family exerts a powerful influence on one's development.""

This is ultimately the opposite of what Luke learns at the end of ROTJ and the Legacy media where he learns of family and love's importance in continuing the Jedi and making it better. She instead only focuses on the individual which only cements her views on individuals, not groups or even families, as being important and this quote is just one suggesting element of how she views the individual. 

Ultimately, what she wants is the destruction of the Force because she can't see of an existence where there is true free will while the Force is the bedrock for all of it that ties to all living things.  She can't stand the idea of an intangible Force having some sway over her life, and would rather see death, devastation, and destruction instead of seeing the force as a necessary building block to life itself. This is like an atheist discovering that God exists, then deciding to kill him out of a drive him out of influencing his life, regardless of how it affects the rest of existence.

What's even more clear is that this is ultimately just a personal vendetta as Kreia doesn't even seem to take into account the idea of ""Libertarian Free Will"" that many sects of theological thought go to, or even various other concepts of a ""controlling deity (or force)"" knowing the outcome of all things, yet still being in line with providing the individual free will. As we've seen in this series, the future within the boundaries of the Force is always in motion and that events may or may not take place. The Force exists beyond the confines of our space and time where things such as space, time, and free will are remote to something as all-encompassing intangible Force. She doesn't seem to take into account the idea that the Force allowing free choice and simply knows and understands all choices and possibilities. 

Ultimately, Kreia is driven by her own resentment of the Force controlling her life, and not by any pure ideology, committing perhaps the biggest folly of skeptical ideologues by defining everyone else's beliefs before her own. She wants to be free of the Force, even at the cost of everything else in existence. 

From all of this, I can only come to the conclusion that she is ultimately a Sith in denial. She only believed in the system of oppression of the force on the universe, the will to destroy it without considering the morality of it, found strength in only considering herself to be correct because of her individual perspective, and had the arrogance to think she was above all of the squabbling between the Jedi and Sith when she was the most deluded of them all to think that existence itself is beneath her to be changed by her drive, power, and will. This doesn't make her any less interesting of a character, nor does it take away any fascinating insight into the nature of the Force or her own critiques. I think that she's an outstanding character because she is a Sith who muddles the water so much in how to perceive her morality and character, and I love the game for that. 

What I do love about this character, this game, and this series is how much you can mine for great content and discussion points, and I'd love to hear what your thoughts are on the matter. ",StarWars,True,1532229909,2018-07-21
"Top Ten Star Wars Movie Endings (last scene, not the climax)",[removed],StarWars,True,1532230993,2018-07-21
Does anyone still miss the little hints Lucas left throughout the Prequels?,"For example: 

The Phantom Menace takes place during peace time and calm political debates, so the first thing we see is a diplomatic ships.

Attack of the Clones start during the height of political tensions throughout the galaxy, so the intro is instead replaced with a diplomatic ship escorted by fighters and high ranking body-guards.

Revenge of the Sith started during the climatic ending of one of the biggest wars in the Galaxy, so literally the first thing we see is hundreds of ships fucking shit up. (Speaking of that scene, Lucas left another hint, the scene starts off with a slow, tension-inducing music, we see two fighters fly in together and cruise next to the peaceful sun, and then the camera pans down to this giant, ferocious battle over Coruscant, this is meant to contrast the Galaxy's state from before The Clone Wars and at the end of The Clone Wars.",StarWars,True,1532232028,2018-07-22
I have a few lore questions,"1. What was the longest the galaxy has gone completely jedi dominant without any sith? What caused the sith to reimurge

2. Same question but with sith dominant without jedi

3. compared to the entire history of the galaxy being filled with space-faring races all living together in peace and in complete domination for power, would you say it is a relatively peaceful or chaotic time? Obviously with the new order having the rebllion on the ropes, its not the best of times but surely old conquests lead by great sith lords could have been far worse than with palpatine and vader accomplished

4. with virtually no jedi or sith left in the galaxy, compared to the history of all the lore, are we to expect the jedi and sith to make a return at a later point? or will it be something different

bonus questions that probably dont have an answer and might get a bunch of eye rolls, but i zone out and think about dumb shit like whats below

5. When we think ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away"", are we supposed to imagine these events really happened by civilizations much older than us but just in  another galaxy?  as if to say us as present day humans managed to salvage a spaceship loaded with eons of history sent from another galaxy and we are learnimg about it? if so, are mandalorians supposed to be human? also what is the lore reason why us humans arent force sensitive? 

6. are there any stories that involved the mandalorians history so far in the past that they would be equal in technology to what we have today? Anyway to tell how much time has passed from that period to TLJ

7. I find it hard to wrap my head around how long the starwars galaxy has been space-faring. from a writers standpoint, you would have full creative control with your story as long as your story happened very far in the past compared to the movies and cant exist in the future beyond where the movies take place so we have many stories that took place thousands of years ago and its all generally the same orbital bombarding, flying car driving, lightsaber wielding, laser blasting universe as if the peak of technology has been achieved thousands of years ago.

is there anything that shows just how old the civilizations really are? according to the starwars timeline, how much time would it take for us humans to achieve have achieved space travel and world colonization, how long before we pretty much hit the peak of technology and how much more time before we are caught up to present day starwars? its 2018 now so are we looking at the year 50,000 before we are caught up?",StarWars,True,1532232305,2018-07-22

Hyperspace tracking,"Just occurred to me that it has happened before:

1) In AOTC, Obi-Wan tracks Jango through hyperspace.

2) In Rogue One, Darth tracks the Blockade Runner that Leia is on through hyperspace. 

3) In A New Hope, the very first Star Wars, Darth and Tarkin tracked the Falcon through hyperspace. 

Why are they treating it as a new thing in TLJ?

Shouldn't Leia and everybody's reaction have been more like, ""how'd they get it on our hull?"", or ""we must have a mole!"", rather than, ""that's impossible!"" (because it isn't)?",StarWars,True,1532235991,2018-07-22
I have a Star Wars theology question concerning the Jedi Order and romance,"So in the original expanded universe, now known as Legends, Leia received some jedi training (correct me if I'm wrong) and she married Han and had Jedi kids.

Luke also dated and eventually married (?) Mara Jade.  Also in the KOTOR games (which I'm pretty sure were canon in the Legends canon) your character could have romantic relationships.  Some of this stuff came before the prequels were conceived, some of it came after.  These instances seem to suggest that force users can have romantic relationships, that love and romance are not in disagreement with operating the force in a positive way



But in the Prequel trilogy, it is against the Jedi Code to either get married and/or have romantic relationships/love.  Anakin marries Padme, going against the Jedi Code, however, looking at events before and after the prequels, other force users have been able to have normal lives and relationships while also being jedi or jedi-lite.

So was the Prequel era Jedi Code wrong on the love/romance ban?  Is that an implication we are supposed to take from all this?  Because if they were wrong on this rule, from a certain point of view, this lead to their downfall.  If Ani had not had to keep his marriage/love to Padme a secret, Palpatine would have lost a major issue he preyed on to turn Anakin",StarWars,True,1532236889,2018-07-22

What is your personal Star Wars story?,"For me, it all started with Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn when I was 8. I wasn't allowed to watch many movies or TV shows back then if they weren't expressly for children (Cartoons), but I was allowed to read at the library next door to my school, and did a whole lot. I saw Heir to the Empire on one of the shelves, and started reading it during reading hour. 

What drew me to the book wasn't the giant hairy man in the corner, or the guy shooting lasers from his fingertips. No, it was the blue man in white in the lower left hand corner. I didn't know what this ""Star Wars"" thing was. I didn't know who Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader or Chewbacca were. But I did know one thing. I liked the colour blue, and this man was blue.

Now, the beauty of Heir to the Empire is you don't actually need to see the original trilogy to know what's happening. Timothy Zahn does a solid job of explaining it all in neat ways so that even an 8 year old kid could have a basic idea of what was going on.

Jump forward 4 years to 2012, when it was announced that Disney was buying Lucasfilm. By this time, I still hadn't seen any of the movies, but I knew everything that had gone down in Episodes 1-6. I then soon learned that the EU was no longer canon in order to make room for new stuff, and I was a little bummed out that the Thrawn trilogy was no longer canon, but I was excited for more Star Wars novels. I had no plans to see the movies.

Jump forward to 2015 and The Force Awakens had come out. I didn't see it in theatres, but I did watch it online when it was available on PutLocker. I was like ""Wow! That was a really good movie!"". 

I then proceeded to watch the other movies in chronological order from 1-5 (As my OCD and desire for order demanded), but I just never got around to Return of the Jedi until after Rogue One came out. I just never found the time.

Then came Star Wars Celebration 2016. I was watching the Rebels livestream because I had since gotten hooked on that show halfway through Season 2. Filoni then said something along the lines of ""Let's expand the universe a little"", and I was like ""Okay, Dave. What EU character are you bringing in?"". Trailer is playing, then the background stuff slows. Tarkin is talking to Pryce, and the organ musoc kicks in. A man enveloped in shadows surrounded by art and lizard statues. I start tearing up a little because the charcter I first experienced Star Wars with half a lifetime ago was coming back. Then Thrawn started talking. ""To defeat an enemy, you must know them. Not simply their battle tactics; but their history, philosophy, art."". Hera and I then both said Grand Admiral Thrawn at the same time, her out of anger/fear, and me out of joy. Then the new Thrawn novel got announced, and I lost my shit.

Flash forward a little under a year, and the Thrawn novel is out. I come home the day it's released, and I see a book on my desk. I'm about to be annoyed at one of my siblings for leaving things on my desk again when I look at the colour. I look at my mom with this dumb grin of pure joy, and she says ""I was at the book store. This was on the new releases shelf. I saw Star Wars, and the title and face looked familiar."". I read it within 24 hours. Benefits of insomnia and fast reading.

Flash forward half a year, and I saw The Last Jedi on opening night. My first Star Wars movie in a theatre. I saw it alone because no one else in my family likes Star Wars all that much and my then-best friends and I couldn't work it into our schedules to see it together and my current best friend/only friend I see in person/crush had promised her dad that the two of them would see it together. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and had a discussion with another guy in the theatre about Thrawn during the credits because you never know if they'll do an end credits scene or not.

Flash forward half a year again, I still haven't seen Solo, I finally got around to Return of the Jedi a few months ago, and I am super excited for the new season of Clone Wars and Thrawn: Alliances.

So that's my Star Wars story. From reading Heir to the Empire at 8 years old to eagerly awaiting the next piece of Star Wars content for me to consume. And hey; for any other fan wh,o like me, started their Star Wars obsession with Legends or loved the old EU, I have two things to say: ""There's always a bit of truth in Legends"", and ""Even when false, Legends can be most informative.""",StarWars,True,1532237980,2018-07-22
"Motives For the First Order, Particularly Snoke","For what its worth, I actually liked The Last Jedi. But one thing that’s bugging me with the sequels (which was brought out in TLJ) is the motivations of the First Order and Snoke.

In basically every story of all time, the villains don’t believe they’re evil. They think they’re right, even though they’re not. The Sith thought the Jedi slighted them for no reason and they wanted revenge. The Separatists had gripes with the Republic and the system. The Empire thought what they were doing was right. The point is, nobody is evil for the sake of being evil. That isn’t believable and it’s lazy writing. People can be pure evil without them thinking they’re wrong.

And after Hux’s speech, it made me think that the First Order had legitimate reasons for doing what they were doing and I was interested in learning what they were. But then one line in The Last Jedi has bugged me since: when Snoke said “As long as [Luke lives], hope lives.” And he presents hope like being a bad thing. It’s like he’s aware that he’s doing evil things. He’s evil for the sake of being evil. That’s really annoying.

That just seems like *such* lazy writing. The conflict is so one sided. The First Order is oppressing people just because. They have no justification for it now. Snoke just doesn’t want the galaxy to have any hope. He wants to drive out hope from everyone in the galaxy. There’s zero depth. I don’t like pointing this out, but a lot of people love Thanos in Infinity War because although he’s doing evil things, he thinks he’s doing good. He’s ultimately wrong, but he believes what he’s doing is right.

The sequels would be so much more interesting if there were actually two sides to them instead of the good guys, and guys who are evil for no reason and even are aware they’re evil. So lazy.",StarWars,True,1532238234,2018-07-22

Which unfinished episodes of the Clone Wars do you think will be released?,"According to Wookiepedia there will be 12 episodes. The episodes featured in the trailer are obviously the Bad Batch arc, which is four episodes. That leaves 8 more episodes. What do you think these 8 episodes will be?

[Here's](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Clone_Wars_Legacy) a page on Wookiepedia that details many of the unfinished arcs. It could be the Dark Disciple arc, which is 8 episodes long. However, that's already been covered in the novel and I don't know if they would want to retell that story. There's also the Son of Dathomir arc, which is four episodes long, but like Dark Disciple it's already been covered in the comics. That leaves the Crystal Crisis on Utapau, Bounty Hunter, Kashyyyk, and Ahsoka's Walkabout arcs, all of which we have confirmed animation reels for and all are four episodes long. A couple other arcs have been spoken about before but I've never seen any animation for them.

I'm thinking that one of these arcs will be the Crystal Crisis on Utapau arc, since like Bad Batch the entire reel has already been released, but that would leave four more episodes.",StarWars,True,1532238711,2018-07-22
Do people actually think Rey is a compelling character?,"I mean, the first ten or so minutes in The Force Awakens was a good setup. We have a scavenger who is good with a staff and speeder bike, but has never been off of the planet. Her outfit was cool, I always liked the desert wrappings aesthetic, and I wish her helmet/head thing came back. But then as the movie went on she got duller and duller. She’s, in my opinion, too quick to trust new people she meets. She should always be slow to trust people because her parents left her behind. She can pilot the Millennium Falcon like an expert within seconds of getting in the cockpit. I know the novels said she had spent hundreds of hours in a Y-Wing training pod or something, but piloting a bomber is very different from piloting a light freighter. It’s like the difference between a crop duster and a 747.

Then she can figure out what’s wrong with the Falcon before Han could, even though he knows the ship like the back of his hand. This could be explained by the Falcon being out of Solo’s hands for so long and others have made modifications that make it difficult for Han to figure out what’s wrong but it’s never explained. Then she can resist Force interrogation from a former student of Luke Fucking Skywalker, and then reverse the probe. She then goes on to use a Jedi Mind Trick, despite believing earlier that Luke Skywalker and the Jedi are myths. Next, she defeats a, admittedly weakened, Kyle Ren.

In The Last Jedi, she goes to Luke’s Island, trains for like a day or two, and now can defeat trained Praetorian Guards with relative ease. She also uses the Force to lift thousands of pounds of rock, even though lifting many small things is harder than one big thing and Luke couldn’t even lift his X-Wind after weeks? days of training with Yoda. She also hasn’t lost an arm, as is tradition with Star Wars protagonists. 

I mean, the whole reason why Luke was compelling was because he got his ass kicked and beaten, before coming back and winning. He only blow up the Death Star after others died, and he needed Obi-Wan’s ghost to tell him. He also needed covering fire from Han Solo. 

I guess I’m asking because I see articles like “Rey is the best Star Wars character” or “Rey is a strong female character.” Both of which can be called objectively false. I don’t know what the best Star Wars character is for you, but for me it’s Ahsoka Tano. Rey being a “strong female character” could be true, if by “strong” they mean “completely uncompelling and boring to watch because she always wins.” But if “strong” means “interesting and likeable,” than they have failed, for me and a lot of other fans.",StarWars,True,1532238975,2018-07-22

If anyone cares to read a bored guy's TFA re-do...,"So in all of the free time I have being on vacation from work, I've gone back and watched TFA and TLJ.  I came up with a rough outline of how I would change VII.  I apologize for it being somewhat all over the place.  It may seems like there are blanks, as I left out a lot of plot points, but these bullet points all line up with how I envision it should have been.


Rey isn't invincible.  She shows potential, but also shows many weaknesses.  She's not freaking perfect.  Keep most of the beginning scavenging stuff with her.  She uses wit to save BB8, not violence.

Finn uses Poe to escape - as highly trained as he is, he hasn't made it through the flight academy, yet.  They don't trust each other, not really.  This is where comedy could come in.  These guys argue a bit.  When Poe asks Finn his name, and he sarcastically responds with his number, Poe sarcastically calls him ""Finn"".  He chooses to go by Finn, but that's not his real name.  More mystery for VIII.  When they reunite, Finn says ""how did you escape?""  Poe says, ""I ejected and went east.""  Finn says ""oh.  I went west.""  (awkward silence).  It is now that they begin having some mutual respect for each other.  That instant buddy-buddy was cringe worthy. 

It is NOT the Falcon Rey and Finn use to escape Jakku.  It's a ship Rey is familiar with, but not the Falcon.  She is a decent pilot just from learning on her own growing up on Jakku.  Phasma is the one chasing them.  They manage to escape by the skin of their teeth.  

Han Solo tracks the BB8 message, thus finds Finn and Rey, and offers them a ride on the Falcon.  There, he explains Luke's exile, and why it is important to find him.

Keep the storm trooper that yelled ""traitor"".  But Finn, who is just as highly trained, puts tr8r down himself, i.e., he doesn't need to be saved by Han.  

Kylo doesn't remove his mask until he is about to kill his father, and he looks rough and battle worn.  He is very powerful.  He doesn't struggle to get info from Rey, because she is still a novice.  But maybe there is just a hint in there that this girl has potential.  Just a small hint.  Kind of like when Steve budged the hammer.

Speaking of Kylo's father, Snoke doesn't say the 5th grade play dialogue ""your father....HAN SOLO"".  It was completely unnecessary of him to say the name.  Poor writing.

Keep final battle between Rey, Finn, and Kylo.  Finn finally meets his match, and is dispatched by Kylo.  Now THIS is when we can finally see the culmination of little hints regarding Rey's potential.  She manages to hold her own against Kylo, but doesn't win outright - he mostly allows her to be competitive because he sees the potential in her, and doesn't want to hurt her.

Rey is the one sent to find Luke because the right people see that there is something about her.  She presents him with A lightsaber.  It doesn't have to be the one he lost.  It's just a lightsaber that was once his, and was obtained by Maz, and presented to Luke by Rey like, ""we need you right now"".  And no helicopter shot at the end.  That was bad.

I also have VIII if anyone care to read it.

Can we fix TLJ while keeping it as Rian wanted ?,"Hi r/StarWars !
So TLJ had a pretty mixed reception when it came out, thoses who loved it praised it's risk taking whereas hardcore fans despised the plot holes and unexplained character changes.
But was there a way to pleasure both ? 

My passion for story-telling made me think about this question. And here I'll try and propose a method to ""fix"" TLJ by only **adding new scenes** I won't cut in the original work because I can respect what the staff did on this movie.

So let's recap the fans biggest gripes with ""plot holes"" in this movie :
&gt; Luke is not a pessimistic guy !

&gt; Snoke's has no backstory ?!

&gt; Leia flying in outerspace is ridiculous !

&gt; Rey is clearly overpowered...

&gt; DID SHE JUST HYPERDRIVE INTO ANOTHER SHIP ?!

I'll tackle them one by one.

**First problem : Luke's characterisation in TLJ :**

The problem here is rather simple, in Star Wars 6 we left a man so optimistic he tried to give *freaking Darth Vader* a redemption because he believed in him. And in TLJ we see a pessimistic Luke who thinks about killing Kylo Ren. This change was not explained in the original TLJ movie. 
What I propose is an additional flashback, maybe as a nightmare of Luke (Luke POV so we don't need an actor for ""young"" Luke) where we can see Snoke training with Luke, and going to the dark side. This way you can explain why Luke is afraid of Kylo Ren/of training people, because he created a real danger for the whole universe. 
I think this should take less than 5minute of actual movie time and could be placed kinda early, when Luke refuses to train Rey, but before the explanation of Kylo/Luke.

**Second issue : Snoke was useless, and his death was stupid.**

I just solved this problem by making Snoke the apprentice of Luke ! It adds more depth to Kylo and having Kylo do what Luke wasn't strong enough to do makes him a good mix of his two masters as Kylo is now between both sides of the Force, which was one of the big themes of the movies, let the old Jedi/Sith division die.
 
**Third issue : Leia is Superman LuL**

Ok so with this one it's really more problematic. But we have an opportunity, as Leia is not the only person shown with incredible Force powers. We could add a scene where Yoda explains to Luke that ""Force wielders scarce has become, unstable the Force it made. Of pure strength worry not, of heart goodness think first."". It could explain that people are using the Force to do crazy things (as it's overloading in the Universe because less people are using it. It might not be plausible, but at least it's an explained rule bending that opens a lot of possibilities !) And also reinforces Luke's last battle because he understand that strength of heart is what he must bring to his students, not technical strength.
As it's also a pretty short scene let's say it's 3 minute, and it could be placed either just before Luke accepts to train Rey, or just as an added line when Yoda appears in the movie.

**Fourth problem : Rey is too powerful !**

Same as before, the problem was that she had no reason to be as strong with the Force without training. We just explained that away with our Yoda scene. But I want to take a little pause here to talk about the possibilities, that our little Yoda trick can offer, get ready because this could be the greatest thing ever :

*A final battle between Rey and Kylo/Last Bad Guy in OUTERSPACE, on a battlecruiser*

Just imagine how cool it could look ! They could fight while standing on X-Wings and shit, that would be both crazy, and original !

**Last Point for today : Hyper drive... in... another... ship... wtf Rian ?**

This might be the hardest thing to fix in the entire movie.The problem with this is that if such a tactical manoeuvre is possible, it breaks the franchise. So it should only be possible exactly when Haldo did it. 
My only idea would be that DJ somehow hacked the shields down, because he has some sort of link with Haldo or something ? It would be awkward to put into place but maybe with a few hints here and there it could work. Also Haldo is supposed to be force sensitive as I read in an interview ? Maybe you could use that and make her control someone that deactivates the ship's shields ? If you have any better idea share them, I'm interested !

So what do you think ? Would you be okay with the Force being overpowered because of a lack of Jedi for a long time ? Would you be fine with Snoke being Luke's first student ?

I had a lot of fun doing this and while I enjoyed TLJ for it's stellar production, the plot holes still had an impact on the overall movie. I hope JJ Abrams will do it's best by not just sweeping TLJ under a rug but try and polish it's story by answering some plot holes.

12 different ways in which some fans are connecting to Luke’s The Last Jedi arc,"Months later I still see some asking, “How can you like Luke’s arc in The Lasr Jedi?” I’ve compiled 12 of the most popular ways in which I’ve heard other Star Wars fans are doing so from all over the web. For some people it’s more than one of these. The more of these they connect with the more they enjoy the arc. Let’s get into them:

* 1) Empathy for him for the difficult life he’s lived, the time he’s already served as a veteran of war, the losses his family has been responsible for, the guilt he’s carried from his father’s acts &amp; from war, and the sacrifices he had made for an Order that had been undone in a moment of weakness by himself and another family member.

* 2) If you’re fascinated by a certain “Cats &amp; the cradle” aspect between him &amp; Anakin now that he’s an older man and if you’re interested in seeing how he handled this biggest regret of his life after having watched how Anakin lived his. Many have likened Star Wars ro Greek tragedy of the gods. This fits.

* 3) If you believe that this “Jake Skywalker” phase is meant to be out of character to what we knew before in the same manner that Darth Vader was out of character to the best of Anakin as a younger man as we saw him. Two falls. Both around temple massacres. Both the father &amp; the son suffer &amp; push out the Light side connection &amp; ties to loved ones &amp; family. That process takes it toll on both in different ways. And yet the journey back &amp; both the father &amp; the son’s desire to atone and that it’s never too late to change and save what you love is similar in the end.

* 4) If you’re fascinated by what could really challenge &amp; break a character like Luke psychologically who had so many heroic traits &amp; had also considered that a mistake he felt personally responsible for that lead to the deaths of innocents and the return of a the evil he thought he’d beaten once before might be just that.

* 5) If you have frustrations about organized religion on Earth and had ever wondered what life might be like without it before.

* 6) If you’d always wondered whether the dark side moment in ROTJ was truly the last such moment in Luke’s life or not or had wondered whether he’d learn improved control beyond what he showed there since he received his happy ending regardless.

* 7) If Luke’s retreat in Empire where he felt he was in a no-win situation and chose to retreat to a metal island and willingly let go and possibly die and leave the fate of the galaxy and his friends to the Force itself connects you to this arc in some way.

* 8) If you believe it’s a good message that when you’re struggling or have hit rock bottom being alone long term is rarely positive and that getting help and letting others in and facing difficult truths and talking is positive.

* 9) If you can accept on some level or value the dramatic need for there to be a complication in act 2 of this story and for Rey to face challenges in her initial goal to bring Luke back, but also introduce complications in the story in order to better setup an interesting arc for her &amp; Ben Solo for IX.

* 10) If you were moved by Luke’s sacrifice when he realized he wanted to &amp; needed to help but had no functioning ship &amp; had to think outside the box as he had so many times before in order to save what he loved by any means necessary.

"Did you connect to Luke’s end of life arc through one of these 12 connections? If so, which one?","Months later I still see some asking, “How can you like Luke’s arc in The Lasr Jedi?” I’ve compiled 12 of the most popular ways in which I’ve heard other Star Wars fans are doing so from all over the web. For some people it’s more than one of these. The more of these they connect with the more they enjoy the arc. Let’s get into them:

* 1) Empathy for him for the difficult life he’s lived, the time he’s already served as a veteran of war, the losses his family has been responsible for, the guilt he’s carried from his father’s acts &amp; from war, and the sacrifices he had made for an Order that had been undone in a moment of weakness by himself and another family member.

* 2) If you’re fascinated by a certain “Cats &amp; the cradle” aspect between him &amp; Anakin now that he’s an older man and if you’re interested in seeing how he handled this biggest regret of his life after having watched how Anakin lived his. A lot of son who were kids in the 1980s never thought they’d get old and see even more of their father inside themselves at old ages. But in some cases that happened with us. The Last Jedi examines this universal phenomenon between aging and generations. Many have likened Star Wars ro Greek tragedy of the gods. This fits.

* 3) If you believe that this “Jake Skywalker” phase is meant to be out of character to what we knew before in the same manner that Darth Vader was out of character to the best of Anakin as a younger man as we saw him. Two falls. Both around temple massacres. Both the father &amp; the son suffer &amp; push out the Light side connection &amp; ties to loved ones &amp; family. That process takes it toll on both in different ways. And yet the journey back &amp; both the father &amp; the son’s desire to atone and that it’s never too late to change and save what you love is similar in the end.

* 4) If you’re fascinated by what could really challenge &amp; break a character like Luke psychologically who had so many heroic traits &amp; had also considered that a mistake he felt personally responsible for that lead to the deaths of innocents and the return of a the evil he thought he’d beaten once before might be just that.

* 5) If you have frustrations about organized religion on Earth and had ever wondered what life might be like without it before.

* 6) If you’d always wondered whether the dark side moment in ROTJ was truly the last such moment in Luke’s life or not or had wondered whether he’d learn improved control beyond what he showed there since he received his happy ending regardless. Yoda told us that once you start down that path (and he did briefly) forever will it dominate your destiny. 

* 7) If Luke’s retreat in Empire where he felt he was in a no-win situation and chose to retreat to a metal island platform and willingly let go and jumped and allowed himself to possibly die and leave the fate of the galaxy and his friends to the will of the Force itself connects you to his actions and choices on Ahch-To in some way.

* 8) If you believe it’s a good message that when you’re struggling or have hit rock bottom being alone long term is rarely positive and that getting help and letting others in and facing difficult truths and talking is positive.

* 9) If you can accept on some level or value the dramatic need for there to be a complication in act 2 of this story and for Rey to face challenges in her initial goal to bring Luke back, but also introduce complications in the story in order to better setup an interesting arc for her &amp; Ben Solo for IX.

* 10) If you were moved by Luke’s sacrifice when he realized he wanted to &amp; needed to help but had no functioning ship &amp; had to think outside the box as he had so many times before in order to save what he loved by any means necessary.

* 11) If you accept in a space Jesus kind of way that word of Luke returning as the Resistance are facing incredible odds after being away for years and staring down the FO by himself, &amp; seeming invincible to save the last of the resistance and his sister, alongside the announcement of new Jedi and the death of Snoke by a girl who may have trained with Luke might inspire hope.

* 12) If you’ve struggled or known anyone close to you who has and felt like you or them hit a rock bottom period in life where you or they made choices they later regretted. Whether it’s PTSD, or a crisis of faith, or becoming estranged from family over an action or a choice... Luke’s The Last Jedi arc allows for us all to bring our own life experiences with suffering &amp; struggle to it.",StarWars,True,1532263448,2018-07-22

Is Clone Wars (not THE Clone Wars) Canon - and where does it fit in the timeline?,"Clone Wars (The 2003 mini series) introduces Ventress and shows Anakin's path to becoming a Jedi Knight, and leaves off right where Episode 3 begins, with Grevious capturing the Chancellor setting up Anakin and Obi Wan's mission at the start of 3. If left alone, it all makes sense.

However now where does The Clone Wars (2008 Tv Show) fit in? Ventress was not reintroduced and already existed in the universe. With Clone Wars really picking up right after 2, and right before 3, its hard to see where The Clone Wars would fit in the timeline. Unless it was all Clone Wars, then The Clone Wars then the final segment of Clone Wars.

Or is it no longer Canon and not fit in the timeline? If thats the case, how do we get the introduction of Ventress and other situations only addressed in Clone Wars?",StarWars,True,1532265644,2018-07-22

But if Disney releases this solely on their paid streaming service, when I'm already paying for things like Netflix and Spotify premium monthly, I might have to, as I simply can't afford to pay monthly for anything else. Please air the episodes on Disney XD, or release a box set as soon as the season ends (and announce it before airing starts so I know I'll get to see it), even let us pay for individual episodes for €1 (or £/$). I want this season, and future seasons to do well, but honestly seeing the clone wars is more important to me than how I see it.

I feel like their is a lot of hate towards the Jedi Order on Reddit,"As long as I've been on this site I have noticed something that is strange to me. And that is that Redditors seem to really dislike the Jedi. This isn't about the people who think the Jedi may be OP in some books or who want more stories about the ""normal people in the galaxy"" instead of the magic space wizards. No this is about the fact that I see a lot of talk about why the jedi suck, why they need to go away and even occasionally why they are the real badguys. Now an argument could be made for a case of seeing it so much because I'm subconsciously looking for it or because the subs get a bit of a echo on certain ideas.  But I feel like even if it was the second one it gets enough noise to look at why people seem to dislike the jedi order. Again this is about the order not about their being to many stories about the Jedi and not enough about troopers/smugglers/akk hound walkers. 

Reason 1)&lt;Removed to not conflict with the no religion rule.&gt;

Reason 2) Only knowing about the PT era Jedi. Now if the PT era Jedi are their only encounters with the Jedi then I can't really blame them all that much since they were made to be out of touch with the will of the force and more focused on the how they do things then the why. Yoda even talks about their problems and we are supposed to see part of it being them loosing their way by going to war and the other being because of sith influence.  But they are a outlier. We have Jedi in the Old Republic who are everything people say they want in jedi (solitary monks, knights going alone on adventures, schools but no council, using emotions and allowing relationships) etc. And while over the ages the Jedi Order was stricter on some things than others it wasn't until after Bane's time that the Jedi became the strict order we see in the PT.  Plus Luke's jedi also change what it means to be Jedi and is more towards what people say they want. In both Legends and the NEU (if the TLJ book can be taken at face value) he allowed emotions, relationships, training adults, and searching out other force using groups. So peoples complaints of the Jedi order only really fit one era of the orders existence. 

Reason 3) The rise of Grey Jedi/Sith apologists. Everyone wants to be special. And whats more special than someone who can use BOTH sides of the force with no negative consequences. By being a grey jedi they can do all the cool force powers like lighting and choking people without having to be the bad guys or listen to a bunch of boring old elders tell them what to do. And it allows them to create their own morality. IE being selfish and thinking that if they are ok with it then its good. Their are also people who see the Sith as the good guys and who honestly think the Sith code is correct and using the dark side is a good thing. Part of this may be due to game play. We see Kyle Katarn and Revan run around shooting out force lighting and still being a good guy so we think that is really cool. But we have had the story group on a number of times point out how a grey jedi really makes no logical sense and how they don't fit wit the ideas of the force and what it means to be a jedi. To quote Pablo the dark side should have more negatives than just glowing eyes. 

Reason 4) Misunderstanding of what a Jedi is. Some people get confused and think of jedi teaching control of emotions as suppression of emotions. While suppressing emotions is unhealthy you can't be a functioning adult without control of your emotions and desires. If you have the chance you should read ""The Jedi Path"" as it talks about this subject. Its not about suppression of wants and emotions its about being able to control them and be able to see the bigger picture beyond yourself.  Some people may also struggle with the idea of living like a monk and chafe under the idea that their are those who know better than them and being guided by another person. Also the idea that jedi kidnap infants and brainwash them which is just wrong on many levels. Being chosen to be a jedi was seen as being a great honor. People loved the Jedi, they were the superheros of the galaxy. So having your child chosen to be one was seen as a great thing. And if the parent didn't want their child to be taken to train it was respected. And remember again this is only a PT era thing that parents were separated from their families. As for the brainwashing that goes back to point number one. I have heard the word brainwashed used a lot on this website whenever a child is being raised in a culture the writer doesn't agree with.  

 
Reason 5) A misunderstanding of Balance. Some people seem to think that Balance means equal light and dark, using both light and dark (like grey jedi), or same number of jedi as their are sith. Their is nothing that says their needs to be an equal amount. In fact the Chosen one prophecy says that the Chosen one would bring balance by destroying the sith. IT didn't say anything about the Jedi in that prophecy. So according to Lucas (the guy who came up with the prophecy) the force is balance when their are Jedi and no sith. Also the same number of Jedi and Sith wouldn't create a balance either since their are numerous force using groups both light and dark outside of the Jedi and Sith orders using the force. So since like Luke said the Jedi aren't the only way to use the force why would them and the sith having the same numbers bring balance if their are 100 nightsisters and 50 Fallanasi still running around. 

Reason 6) Some people just like to be contrary. Its fun to play the villian and some people may just like going that route or honestly believe the bad guys are right.  I have nothing against this part other than their are times it can get in the way of discussion if someone doesn't point out they are just playing the villain. 

Reason 7) (thanks to u/Moriartis for this one) I think an interesting point for you to consider would be the rise of nihilism and post-modernism in modern America. A couple of your points have this as a common theme. According to nihilism/post-modernism, nothing really matters and any objective view of things or any view that puts value judgments on anything is inherently wrong (yes, this is self-contradictory and no, nihilists/post-modernists don't seem to grasp that, but I digress).

Religion is pretty much the antithesis of nihilism/post-modernism, seeing as how it is almost entirely based on value judgments, so it fits in with reason 1 really well. This also fits this respect for the Grey Jedi/Sith you mention in reason 2. If it's all up to interpretation and nothing really matters, why not be a Grey/Sith? It denies the validity of the light side, thus a ""non-judgmental"" side like the Grey Jedi fits more in line with their ideology.

This also ties into reason 3 when you say ""the idea that there are those who know better than them and being guided by another person"". Again, nihilism and post-modernism reject this because doing so would support value judgments.

I would argue this explains a lot of what you're noticing. Now, mind you a lot of people will actively espouse nihilistic/post-modernist beliefs without knowing that is what they are espousing, so in most cases it's not a label they will be aware of or even agree to, but I would argue it fits quite well and explains a lot of the Jedi hate of Reddit.

IDK this is just something that has been poking around in my head for a bit.

"An honest question about The Last Jedi’s Score. Are there any good, standout songs in the soundtrack?","A couple of things to note. I don’t like TLJ. I teeter between outright hate and apathy. BUT I love Star Wars, I even named my daughter after Rey. Lately I’ve been looking for reasons to not hate TLJ because I want to enjoy the sequel that stars my daughter. 

One of my griefs with the film is that I feel it’s the first main story movie that has absolutely no original or standout songs. Even with the most sour notes of the prequels, (personally I love them) the score was amazing and unforgettable. Duel of the fates, Across the stars, battle of Heroes, and TFA had Rey’s theme and Jedi steps. 

I’ve scoured TLJ soundtrack and can’t find one theme that’s not recycled. I even saw on Wikipedia that it’s the first film that wasn’t spotted with director and composer together, Williams was only given temp tracks. Did that affect it? No flame or hate meant in any of this particular post. ",StarWars,True,1532284503,2018-07-22
Does Rex know about Anakin and Padmé's relationship?,"It is imply that both Obi-Wan and Ahsoka picked up on their relationship during the Clone Wars.

Why are Clone Troopers more often depicted with Temuera Morrison's face than with Bodie Taylor's?,"No clone could have been biologically older than 26 during the clone wars, yet Morrison was in his forties during ROTS.

Even the clones in TCW and the more recent comics, who I think often didn't bear much resemblance to either actor, seemed to look older and thus more similar to Morrison.

So I just sat down and watched the 2003 clone wars...,"First of all, I thought it was absolutely fantastic. Loved the animation, it really helped drive that darker tone through out the series.

Second, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I like Anakin’s portrayal much better in this series than in the follow up show. This Anakin is one that I could still believe would turn to the dark side. A highly skilled warrior who never embraced the Jedi. The Anakin we see in Filoni’s series is obviously the one that we all like more, but I think we like him for all the things that Anakin was never supposed to be. A charismatic leader? No. Anakin was never a personality that soldiers rallied to. He showed up to a war zone and changed the outcome of battles, and he was deemed the chosen one by many in the Jedi order. But he was revered for his fighting skill and mastery of the force, not his vocal leadership and ability to rally troops.

When you step back and think about it, the Anakin we see in TCW seems like a totally different character than in the movies and the 2003 clone wars series. That character would never turn to the dark side the way Anakin did in ep 3.

The 'Star Wars' Prequel Trilogy: JediZim's Cut,"I'm not going to lie, I feel like I'm putting myself in a position to be attacked, but here goes nothing.

Long story short, I grew up enjoying the Prequels as a kid and always felt confused when I heard people saying that they were terribly done, had stilted dialogue, etc. Then I saw Mr. Plinkett's reviews.

Naturally, it's frustrating being a fan of a franchise that started out so well only to watch it sink so low. Of course, I could still understand and appreciate what Lucas was trying to do, and I still believed in it; I just also believed that it could have been executed a lot better.

When I landed myself in an Army transition unit, I ended up working my butt off in my spare time trying to re-write, or even simply cut, various scenes and bits of dialogue so that the Prequels wouldn't suck as much.

BTW, if these scripts look a little off here and there, it's because I realized I should probably remove my real name and replace it with my Reddit user name.

With all of the above being said, I'd appreciate some honest feedback. In all honesty, I believe that a big key that made the OT successful was collaboration, whereas Lucas had TOO MUCH control for the Prequels. Honest feedback is how people and works grow, so let's get a discussion started about how to improve storytelling, dialogue, etc.

May the Force be with you.

Another Lame Snoke Theory,"Alright, I know I'm probably the millionth person to post one of these, but I thought I might have a pretty cool one. 

Now I don't know if this has been canonically proven/disproven yet, but I'm holding onto the belief that Snoke is Plagueis. I know I'm not the first person to say that either but hear me out. 
We all know the infamous Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise as told by his apprentice, Darth Sidious. Sidious tells us that Plagueis “could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.” This would lead us to believe that Plagueis basically could blur the lines between life and death. Now this isn’t your run of the mill immortality. I believe that this is the ability to control whether someone’s soul becomes “one with the Force.” 

When someone in the Star Wars universe dies, people say that their soul has become “one with the Force.” Again, not something I know that has been canonically proven/disproven yet, but I think that this means that “The Force” (in the sense of death) is a place where all the energies, Force abilities, memories, and experiences or every Force user in history has combined into one mass of energy in the afterlife. Whenever a Force user dies, their energy is then added to said mass. I believe that when Plagueis stops death, he is basically stopping someone’s soul from being added to this mass. Plagueis knows of this Force mass and knows that it is a combination of the skills of all the most powerful Jedi and Sith in history. What if Plagueis had the ability to absorb power from this mass? What if Plagueis stopped blurring the lines between life and death for himself and allowed his apprentice to “murder” him so that he could join this mass so that he could spend years absorbing power from it. We all know Plagueis was a powerful Sith Lord so I imagine he had some kind of premonition ability. I think that Plagueis had foreseen the possibility of a massive Jedi slaughter (Order 66) and the deaths of Yoda (one of the most powerful and knowledgeable Jedi of all time), Sidious (his own apprentice with who he bestowed great power), and Anakin (The Chosen One). I think that Darth Plagueis allowed himself to be killed by Palpatine to make his death seem more legitimate, and then spent decades leeching off the Force abilities and knowledge of countless Jedi and Sith. 

This leads us to the ever so conflicting sequel films. Enter Snoke, who I believe to be Plaqueis. Snoke is just the alias that he is using after being “dead” for the past few decades. All those years spent leeching off the power of dead Force users, and he takes control of the First Order to rule the galaxy with a new apprentice. This would explain how he is such an intimidating Force user in Episodes 7 and 8. Fast forward to The Last Jedi. One of the most controversial moments was Snoke’s death, but I think that this is just Snoke/Plagueis using the same trick twice. Snoke/Plagueis premonition abilities have kicked in again, and he senses the coming death of Luke Skywalker, the Jedi Master who helped to overthrow the Empire and studied under two very powerful Jedi. Snoke/Plagueis now thinks to himself, “when Luke dies, I need to steal some of his abilities, and come back even more powerful than before.” He also knows that Kylo is harboring a bit of ill will for him, and much like he does with Sidious, allows himself to be killed to remove suspicion from himself, and so that he can once again have access to this Force mass. I believe that Snoke/Plagueis is currently leeching more energy from the Force Mass of the afterlife, and will once again blur the lines of life and death to return in Episode 9 and wreak havoc upon the galaxy.  

TL;DR: Snoke is Plagueis, but has allowed himself to die twice so that he can absorb the powers of death Jedi and Sith in the afterlife, and will bring himself to back to life in order to become the most powerful Sith in the Galaxy.

I was super giddy the whole movie, because, you know, YODA, LUKE SKYWALKER, KYLO REN, man that movie was great. I'd say it's in my top 3 Star Wars movies honestly.

With the announcement of a CW return...,"I start with saying that I really enjoyed the Rebels seasons.  I loved seeing the growth of the characters, a return of Ahsoka, and the brief moments of Tarkin and Vader.  Loved it, but.....

The problem with rebels is, it was in a 30 minute time slot and made for the younger age.  You only got 22 min of actual show.  A lot of the episodes felt rushed and some story lines were under developed....

Now Clone Wars...  AWESOME.  I dont like how death isn't permanent in Hollywood, but I actually liked Maul coming back, seeing how awesome a fighter Mace was, why the clones were such an impressive army compared to the stormtroopers, the Grevious story arc.... I could go on....  One of the things, and I feel this was a major reason, that allowed CW to be so good was it being in a hour time slot.  You had about 42 minutes of show time.  The plot lines were developed, episodes didn't feel rushed, and at the end of each episode their was a feel of entertainment gratification.

I personally hate Rebels, i really tried to get into it after i realized Clone Wars wasnt getting a revival anytime soon but couldnt. A big part of it was it didnt look like Clone Wars.

Does This Windu Line From Son Of Dathomir Create This Small Continuity Problem For the Time Being?,"So because Dooku and Maul temporarily team up in the comic Son of Dathomir, Windu assumes that Dooku is the Master and Maul is the Apprentice, and on the surface it’s a cool scene since Windu is discussing this to Palpatine. But there’s a problem with this.

If Windu thinks Maul is in league with Dooku, then that means he thinks Maul and is forces are part of the Separatist Confederacy. The Siege of Mandalore takes place during Revenge of the Sith and technically never really finishes. Here’s where I’m going with this.

In Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine and Windu talk about how destroying Grevious will end the war, that Grevious is basically their only priority. But if Windu thinks Maul is apart of the Separatists, destroying Grevious wouldn’t mean the end of the war. Maul, who Windu and the rest of the Jedi have admitted is extremely powerful, would still be a legitimate threat to them.

But not only that, I feel like there’d be more surprise and confusion in the revelation that Palpatine was the Sith Lord they’d been looking for, since they had previously thought Dooku was the master. Is there some piece of canon that I’m missing where Windu changes his mind, or...?

The easiest fix, and I hope they do this, is for Windu to realize Maul and Dooku actually aren’t in league in The Clone Wars Season 7 that we’re getting. At some point he needs to realize he’s wrong and start from scratch.

Obviously this is extremely minor, but it was just on my mind and I just thought it was something to talk about.",StarWars,True,1532332148,2018-07-23

The end of the Saga in IX,"How will IX end? They can‘t let it end with Kylo simply dying because that would be the same as RotJ and therefore the whole ST would be pointless. They can‘t let the first order win, because ending the Saga on a downnote isn‘t very fairytaley/ star warsy.

So it has to somehow end with balance between light and dark. Either Reylo will happen or at least Rey and Kylo will find a way to coexist. That would also rhyme with PT darkness wins, OT light wins, ST balance wins.

This would also open an arc for Finn. Becoming a leader and leading the stormtroopers out of their „slavery“.

“Fan service” versus “artistic vision”. Discuss :),I think we are at an inflection point in the world of Disney owned Star Wars.

Luke vs Anakin in ROTJ Is by far a really under-appreciated part in the saga,"The only reason why I am calling Vader Anakin is because on Endor thats when Vader changes back to the Jedi he once was, finally acknowledging and regretting his actions years prior with the line *“It is too late my son”*

Anakin knows that he has to bring Luke to the emperor and Luke knows that as well. 
The Emperor is the true villain of ROTJ a deceiving bastard but is still the prominent role in the duel.
Anakin nor Luke want to fight but the Emperor wants to bash them together like children’s toys knowing one is going to break.

The entire scene with Anakin and Luke underneath that platform is one of the most emotional scenes in the saga as you see Lukes face half light and half dark, which you all know is symbolizing the balance between the force, and the badass, tear-driven score by Williams is also underrated after Anakin says *”Sister, You have a sister, if you will not turn to the darkside then perhaps she will”* at this point Luke is enraged taken up by the darkside while it does not consume him fully like his father.

Luke manages to cut off Anakins hand once more and realizes this is not right.

The Emperor starts to toy with him seeing that the darkside has nearly consumed him like his father and then gets pissed off when he refuses.
You can almost see Anakins facial expressions through the mask once the emperor tortures *his son* knowing this is the perfect chance to fulfill his once destiny to balance the force along with his son. 

When Luke goes and tries to kill Ben Solo in his sleep that is the same feeling as he had on the second death star but this time the one who had consumed the darkside was Ben.",StarWars,True,1532337445,2018-07-23

Rose is awesome. Y’all are weird.,"Rose is a very specific character in TLJ. She fulfilled the archetype of an innocent. In TFA. Rey mostly embodies this archetype. It’s important to have this in a classic good versus evil story like Star Wars. It establishes the good guys as good and the bad guys as bad. Rey’s innocence and Kylos cynicism are firmly juxtaposed in TFA, not only through character but through the use of color, contrasting lighting and wardrobe, and their opposite sex. However in TLJ each character is changing Rey becomes more cynical and battle hardened, Kylo yearns for redemption. This is again shown with Rey wearing a Grey outfit (million dollars says she will be wearing black in episode 9) Kylo keeping his mask off (showing humanity) and contrasting or complimentary lighting. But now Rey isn’t innocent any more. Therefore this role has to be taken by someone else. Rose is innocent and pure hearted. She is a positive influence on Finn and deftly establishes the resistance as good and helps Finn overcome his cowardice and selfishness (he’s only concerned about Rey because he has a crush) Rose was obviously a very thought out character. Her face is expressive and she has big happy cheeks and wide eyes. She is shouting at the audience (with her facial expressions and body language alone) that the resistance stands up for the innocent and wins the moral argument. This saves time in a film like this instead of showing the resistance donating food or being cuddly with Ewoks a cute Asian girl is presented and we believe her when she says the resistance is good. That’s why she was put in the movie NOT TO TICK A BOX ON THE DIVERSITY CHECKLIST. ",StarWars,True,1532354153,2018-07-23

"[Discussion] Don't upvote, but #CloneWarsSaved seems... Hypocritical? Unfair? Maybe I'm overthinking this.","Hear me out, and sorry in advance for the wall of text.

Following The Last Jedi, it seemed there was a counter-backlash against fans who didn't like the irreverent tone of the film. Since then, the consistent message out of Disney has been, ""This is an entertainment product - a commodity - and if you attach your identity to it, that reflects poorly on you.""

I'm not making this up, right? We pay our nickel, we watch the moving picture, we go home. I'm not condoning any toxicity toward individuals who worked on or appeared in the film; they were just doing their jobs. But it seemed like even a general dislike of the movie has been met with ""IT WAS ENTERTAINMENT, GET A LIFE NERD"" and ""IF YOU DEFINE YOURSELF AS A STAR WARS FAN, YOU NEED HELP.""

But now the message is, #CloneWarsSaved. So Clone Wars was in jeopardy, it has been rescued, and this is a cause for celebration - tell your friends. 

Why should I tell my friends?

I am a mere consumer of entertainment. I am not your social media advocate. You spend your billions to advertise your products, and if my friends don't come across your advertisements, that's your problem. **If you're asking me to promote your television series out of a sense of good will toward your franchise, but you dismiss any criticism I have as the empty sound and fury of a loser, that relationship seems awfully one-sided.**

Perhaps I'm not being fair. I'm absolutely certain that there is someone, maybe multiple people, on the Disney payroll who has staked their reputation and possibly their career on the success of this television series. They felt that Clone Wars had been cancelled before it reached its full potential, and they want to prove that there are still great stories to be told.

But it does seem to me that Disney wants a community of active Star Wars fans to exist **when it helps their bottom line.** I know, I know, ""they're a corporation, wake up sheeple"" etc., but it is not impossible for a business to take feedback on board, rather than dismissing it or doubling-down on the course they've taken.

There are media production companies, even large ones, that have a two-way street of communication and feedback with their consumer base. And then you have companies like Electronic Arts following Mass Effect 3. 

If the holder of a franchise hopes to earn and retain my good will as a consumer, I expect my valid criticism of their franchise's products to be treated *as valid criticism.* I shouldn't be lumped in with a frog-faced twitter troll because I didn't like the way they treated the material.",StarWars,True,1532356361,2018-07-23

It's really interesting to see the demographics of this fandom changing in real time,"With all the prequel-era material that's been confirmed lately, the response of the fandom to it was really interesting.

It seems that the majority (or maybe the most vocal subgroup) of the fandom is actually excited about LF warming up to the era. Which is interesting because I remember back in the day when people utterly hated anything about the prequels and I doubt the new material would have been as well recieved as it has been.

In my theory it is caused by kids who actually grew up on the prequels and liked them back then (myself included) have grown up and actually have their voice in the fandom, so obviously they are excited to see the things they've grown up with return.

Poe and Kylo Ren, *Inside Llewyn Davis*

Hux and Rey, *Peter Rabbit*

Poe and Hux, *Ex Machina*

I still get queasy watching the Roshomon-esque flashbacks in TLJ...,"It makes me sick because Luke Skywalker would never do that...there's so many different ways this could have went down if you kept that same basic idea.

1. He walks in with his saber, and that is the reason Ben attacks him, even though he just peers into his mind and Luke never meant to harm him (remember Yoda telling Luke not to bring the saber into the cave? This would be that playing out, and Luke would never want to carry a saber again after this)

2. It is Ben who attacks Luke. Ben didn't want to be trained as a Jedi, he hated it, it's not for him. He was not meant to be one. He's not a humble person, he lusts for power and status. So Snoke tells him a way he can have all of that.

3. The reason Ben turned is because his grandfather's identity was kept a secret. He learns about it from none other than Snoke, who knows he can create a new Vader. Ben feels that no one trusted him enough to tell him the truth, and his whole life has been a lie. That they fear him as some monster like Vader, so he becomes a monster.

4. In Luke's moment of instinct he only lifts the saber off of his belt and doesn't ignite it.

5. IF you're still going to have him ignite it, show the VISION THAT LUKE SAW. Ben with his blue saber attacking padawans, a jump to the future with the Knights of Ren in the rain like Rey saw, and Han dying. Then it makes sense that his instinct would take over to stop all of this. Still, you think he'd warn Han that is son would kill him, huh? 

What do you think of my ideas? I just can't stand the vision when Luke has those sickly eyes and the glow of his saber swinging at Ben (even though this is Ben's version of the truth)",StarWars,True,1532371140,2018-07-23

The announcement of Clone Wars return...,"I start with saying that I really enjoyed the Rebels seasons.  I loved seeing the growth of the characters, a return of Ahsoka, and the brief moments of Tarkin and Vader.  Loved it, but.....

The problem with rebels is, it was in a 30 minute time slot and made for the younger age.  You only got 22 min of actual show.  A lot of the episodes felt rushed and some story lines were under developed....

Now Clone Wars...  AWESOME.  I dont like how death isn't permanent in Hollywood, but I actually liked Maul coming back, seeing how awesome a fighter Mace was, why the clones were such an impressive army compared to the stormtroopers, the Grevious story arc.... I could go on....  One of the things, and I feel this was a major reason, that allowed CW to be so good was it being in a hour time slot.  You had about 42 minutes of show time.  The plot lines were developed, episodes didn't feel rushed, and at the end of each episode their was a feel of entertainment gratification.  

For the return of CW....  PLEASE be put into an hour slot again.  PLEASE give it the same attention that the series received before.  And PLEASE gear it more for adult intellect as the previous CW was.

episode 9 theory (extension of a snoke theory),"this is an addition to a snoke theory which i saw on youtube. i dont know the identity of the original writer of this theory but if anyone does i would be happy to credit them. the theory goes that plagueis was immortal and took over the body of palpatine, this is why palpatine speaks so highly of someone who he supposedly killed. also notice how palpatines voice changes when knighting vader as a sith almost like it the voice of plagueis' spirit. he then wanted to take over the body of luke so tried killing him when he wouldnt become his apprentice. he then took over the body of vader after he was burned at the end of return of the jedi and used vaders dna to create new limbs, like how he could create life. this is why he wanted kylo ren to be a new vader as he was so proud of the monster he created that was vader so he made vader kylos inspiration. that is the original theory with a bit added on at the end about him wanting kylo to be like vader, now for my extension. i propose that now snoke was ""killed"" in TLJ that ren will die and he will take over his body and revealing himself to be immortal to rey and gloating about how he cannot be stopped. this causes rey with the help of luke and other jedi as force ghosts to go around the galaxy in search of ancient magic or force techniques that could seal plagueis and this is where the movie starts possibly with a flashback showing how kylo ren died. the movie would end with rey discovering this technique and ending the wrath of the most important and powerful character in the whole saga giving it the true happy ending it deserved because if this theory is true then the end of return of the jedi wasnt really  happy, it just ended with another one of plagueis's puppets being destroyed. i know it wont happen but whatever

TL;DR: plagueis is palpatine and snoke and snoke is vaders body and then he takes over kylo and he is immortal and rey ahs to seal his spirit",StarWars,True,1532379793,2018-07-23

Have you heard the tragedy of Luke Skywalker the wise? It's not a story Disney would tell you.,"Arguably he is now the worst Jedi of all time. He's responsible for the creation of Kylo Ren, the death of billions and the destruction of the Hosnian system from SKBase (so he now has a higher kill count than even the Emperor himself), Lor San Tekka, all of his students, whom are just a plot device, etc...

Not only that, he was stripped of his Force powers so he would not overshadow Rey. He could not be more powerful or wise than her. She's right about Kylo Ren! She's so much more wise than Luke freakin' Skywalker! Because she used the Force for the first time yesterday! Training? Who needs that! ""You were wrong thinking that his choice was already made!"" Rey the Wise. She's practically a Jedi master already. What has she actually done? Did she destroy the Death Star, redeem her father? No....

Can you see now how Disney ruined Luke Skywalker? It makes me never even want to watch the original trilogy again. I can't even read any canon materials about Luke. I have Weapon of a Jedi I recently bought, but can't start it. You know what he's been turned into, so why bother? 

It's why I've been watching the Clone Wars lately. I want to stay as far away from the ST as possible, but since it's also ruined the OT, I need to stay as far away from that as well. So I'm exclusively PT era now, and excited for Thrawn Alliances tomorrow. Do you see what Disney has done? With the ST being a creative failure that wasn't planned out that has also tarnished the OT, they've led many of us to revere the days of the PT, and escape and hide away in that era.

A Star Wars dream I had when I was young...,"It took place before Phantom Menace ever graced our cinemas...

It began with a five miles long starship. Yoda is arguing with a young Jedi about leaving someone behind, because the Jedi are evacuating from a Republic now in the hands on the Sith Emperor and his black armoured apprentice Vader. Their ship was previously a single building on the surface of the Republic capitol, the entire planet is just a gathering of starships.

Anyway back to the dream... 

The young Jedi storms off to the flightbay where he is prevented from departing the ship on orders of Yoda. So he takes a technician inspection environment (the tie being a pre militarized tie fighter pod without the hexagonal panels). And he flies it through the ship superstructure exiting out of the massive docking port from which ships are comming and going (like that square hole at the bottom of star destroyers only bigger.

In the traffic lanes over coruscant he bails out and drops ten miles to a wet grassy balcony garden kept overly watered by a moisture vaporator. He is met by a young ben kenobi. Vader is seen inside the building excorting a royal hostage (apparently the emperor has insisted on a collection of princesses as royal hostages to keep vassal governments in line). These 'diplomats' are being allocated apartments in the building. Ben Kenobi goes off to retrieve the princess. Vader returns. A battle between the jedi and vader forces the jedi warrior to climb up the outside of the building to a balcony ledge leading to the apartment of one of the royal hostages - this one with a personal guard with red armour. He spends the night in her company (thus luke and leia have different mothers) before he is arrested by a security droid (it looks like an imperial probe droud from hoth except it is bigger and has bigger and nastier scythe-like blades and blasters). These security droids patrol the hallways.

Once again returned to Vader, he kills Vader in combat and dons the Armour passing himself off as Vader. 

It kind of ended there...

Other than an entertaining third act, the story is an uninteresting and drawn out slog with a bland, passive main character and her band of even more bland and uninteresting friends.

I just finished season 5 of the Clone Wars. Wow.,"There will be spoilers here. You've been warned. 


This season was definitely the best in my opinion. Not a full episode in the lot, if you watch it as it's meant to be watched, in arcs. There's plenty of drama, espionage, and action to be had here with Maul/Savage, Death Watch, Mandalore, Sidious, and of course the guy wrenching Ahsoka Framed arc. I have only cried watching two other animated episodes in my life: Twin Suns (Rebels Season 3 finale) and Jurassic Bark in Futurama. When Ahsoka left, I could feel her pain. She was abandoned and failed by the only people she trusted. Filoni outdid himself.


I only have one question, however. When Ian Abercrombie passed away, why did Lucasfilm hire Tim Curry to play Palpatine? They already had Sam Witwer. His Palpatine is incredible. And why not Ian McDirmid? Tim Curry's voice just didn't match, and always seemed out of place.

Anyway, if Season 7 is anything like S5 was, we're in for a treat.",StarWars,True,1532407967,2018-07-24
Emotionally stirring,"So I was just grinding away on a video game (Destiny 2) and as always I put my headphones on to listen to music as always. I though it’d be a good idea to listen to some Star Wars scores while doing some badassery. I didn’t expect what happened when I got to Battle of the Heroes.

I was genuinely crying through it. With no provocation, nothing from the game, just the music and my thoughts. Just sitting there and listening to the absolutely amazing score, and realising the affects of two people, who have known each other for a long time and, through many tribulations, forged a friendship and a bond, for them to suddenly fight to death because of the manipulation and subtlety of the Dark Side. Thinking about all the things Anakin had been through, and doing what he thought was right: just saving the woman he loves and stopping what happened to his mother, from happening to her. Also thinking about how Obi-Wan never wanted to mentor Anakin, but did to respect (what is essentially his father figure) Qui-Gon Jinn, and despite himself, he grew fond of Anakin and genuinely saw him as a brother. 

Thinking of all of this while listening this outstandingly orchestrated score on my headphones, just lead me to break for a minute or two. Of course, I have seen RotS so many times, that I could easily picture, in my mind, what part of the fight certain parts of the score was played during it. So I can easily say the most emotional part was when the score slowed down and changed a little (when Obi-Wan and Anakin are standing on the droids flowing down the lava river and Obi-Wan states how he failed him). Thinking of all the previous things and the slowed down score was something else. It has led me to appreciate RotS even more, and how it does a good job of showing, and feeling, how two friends eventually want to kill eachother.

I would like to hear thoughts on this.

Palpatine’s midi-chlorian count.,"Palpatine is one of the most powerful people in the Star Wars universe. And I’m am fairly confident what his midi-chlorian count his. Although midi-chlorian count doesn’t directly correlate to power in the force, it determines the maximum force potential of a individual. 

George Lucas has said that anakin skywalker had twice the force potential as palpatine. If anakin skywalker had a midi-chlorian count of 20 000, wouldn’t that mean Palpatine’s midi-Chlorain is approximately half that, a midi-chlorian of 10 000.

We need to talk about the Star Wars community and the franchise,"I love Star Wars and I used to love the Star Wars community.

But lately, I don't want to step foot in anything Star Wars related except for /r/PrequelMemes since TLJ. I'm not excited for anything Star Wars related that is coming out over the next few months, and its not because of TLJ; it's because of the community. We have become a hive of toxicity and complaining that spends more time trashing other star wars community members than talking about the franchise we claim to love. We all need talk to each-other in a healthier way, and I'm not saying that we don't need to voice our opinions. I'm saying how we express our opinions and disapproval for others opinions needs to change.

I don't see the love and respect for each other around really any Star Wars community anymore. Almost all conversations devolve into ugly one side versus the other arguments that bleed onto social media and effect the people who work so hard to bring us the stories we have come to love.

Here is the biggest kicker for the whole situation. We have a reputation now that we're toxic and that our fandom is ""split"". We used to be a community that accepted anyone and everyone who dreamed of being a jedi or a smuggler, but now we've become an exclusive group founded on hate. We have become the very thing that we swore to destroy.

Guys and Gals, please love each other again. I miss the days where everyone treated each other with respect and love. Even if their Snoke theory sucked.

"Re-watched TLJ on Netflix the other day, and actually grew to love it more.","I know there’s been a lot of debate and criticism over the movie, and that’s good! Movies are subjective, and if you have legitimate praise/criticism, then those opinions should be respected. With that all said, I do want write my praise for the film after seeing it again on Netflix. 

Mainly I appreciate that Johnson gave the movie important themes, and took the overall narrative in a more interesting direction compared to TFA. I liked TFA, but as many have said,  it did hug A New Hope a bit too hard. The future of the trilogy was a bit uninteresting in my opinion following episode seven. Snoke was a boring Palpatine clone , Rey looked like she was gonna be another Skywalker, Luke looked like he has gonna be another Yoda. Before TLJ came out, it felt like fans had already predicted the film. However, Johnson took it in a direction that was  unexpected, interesting, and better for the trilogy. Rey’s better developed since she comes from nothing, Kylo is more interesting since he killed Snoke. Even Luke is the most memorable since Empire! 

Without dragging on, I’d like to quickly go over my other points. I liked the message and themes of the casino subplot. I liked the reveal that Holdo was actually smart and had a good plan, forcing Poe to grow as a character. Many people here will disagree, and that’s fine, it’s Star Wars. It’s a fun space fantasy, and appeals to everybody in different ways. Hopefully I was able to illustrate why I liked the film, and maybe  some here on this sub will agree with me! Thanks guys!

What I Don't Understand...,"Is how the anthology movies (Rogue One &amp; Solo) have limits such as the era, characters, plot, setting, how they do this or that &amp; etc. but are considered 'good' by a majority of the fandom while the Sequel Trilogy has practically no limits but is so divisive. 

Yes, movies should cause discussion, but never have I ever seen a movie so divisive as TLJ. Should be that a majority agree it's bad or good, but it's literally 50/50 (one of my friends groups is made up of 4 people including me &amp; literally 2 love it while the other 2 hate it).

Again, I don't understand how movies with limits are better than the movies without limits. Yes, that statement is opinonated but when a movie like TLJ is super divisive, their doing something wrong. I see it as the Sequel Trilogy playing it too safe. They could go in so many new different directions but instead it's rehashing the same story we've seen before (aside from SOME moments that are new &amp; cool). Say what you will about the Prequel Trilogy but it at least expanded the Star Wars universe tenfold.

"My version of the prequels, part 1 of 3","Star Wars I: The Chosen One

Starts out with a space battle between the Republic and the Separatists. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan's ship is hit and crashes into the nearby desert planet of Tatooine. There they discover the slave boy (about 16 years old in this version) Anakin Skywalker and realize he has a strong connection to the force. Anakin helps them fix their ship and they help pay for his freedom to take him back to the Jedi Temple to receive Jedi training. The Jedi Council hesitantly obliges and the movie focuses on Anakin's journey through the Jedi Academy in Coruscant. Side plot of Queen Padme Amidala strategizing with the Jedi council plans to attack the Separatists at their home base, demonstrating her capability as a leader and warrior. 

Meanwhile, most of the jedi padawans of Anakin's age  group had grown up together at this point so Anakin is ostracized and almost looked down upon due to his background as a slave. The movie takes us through the training a Jedi goes through (including the Marksman-H combat remote that Luke uses as homage to Episode 4). Anakin performs exceedingly well in all his tests and incurs the jealousy of his classmates. Have an antagonizing padawan (let's name him Galen just to make referring to him easier) character make Anakin's life in the academy a living hell by bullying him. However, Qui-Gon provides a strong fatherly figure support to Anakin (and Obi-Wan). One night while they are all sleeping in the dorms, the Separatists, led by Darth Maul, attack. It is revealed that there is a spy in the midst of the Republic, as the Separatists somehow knew that the Queen was in Coruscant. The queen is captured. 

While the Jedi Masters take on the hordes of droids on the front lines and in space, the Padawans spring to action and crawl through vents and underground spaces to sneak behind enemy lines. Through cooperation and clever devising, they manage to defeat many droids that they encounter. Anakin and Galen, the two best performing Padawans, drop from a vent and confront Darth Maul, threatening him to let the queen go. Maul scoffs and instructs his guards to stand back. A lightsaber duel ensues. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon engage in a ferocious space battle against the Separatists, Qui-Gon feels a great disturbance in the force and retreats to go check in on Anakin. Back to the lightsaber duel, it becomes obvious that Maul is toying with Anakin and Galen. Anakin taps into his rage and keeps striking Darth Maul, distracting him long enough for Galen to get a hit in on Maul's shoulder. Maul is enraged and stabs Galen. As he turns to Anakin to finish him off, Qui-Gon steps in and takes the blow instead. With his dying breath, he instructs Anakin to escape with the queen. Qui-Gon musters the strength to keep fighting Maul while Anakin and Padme escape, and we see him on his knees as the sliding doors close. We see Obi-Wan feel a disturbance in the force. Anakin and Padme work together to take down the droids on their way to safety. 

Film ends with Anakin and Obi-Wan by Qui-Gon's grave, uncertain of what the future may hold now that their master is no longer. Obi-Wan puts his arm around Anakin's shoulder, and the credits roll. ",StarWars,True,1531347733,2018-07-11

"Hopefully a more informed fan can explain to me this question about Maul, Palpatine, and Dooku.","Ok. It seems like in the cannon we have aside from the side stories (Solo, R1) that the only time the rule of two seemed in force is when Palpatine and Vader were running the empire.

For the clones to have been set up on Kamino (fantasy spelling?) and to have developed as many as fast as they did, Wouldn't it have taken longer that the time between Episode one and two?

The ending to episode IX seems very predictable.,Because they killed off Snoke how else can they end episode IX other than Rey succeeding?

"Guys, the Disney movie scores frankly disappoint (Rant Incoming)","Save for a few themes from the Force Awakens (Kylo’s flourish, Rey’s theme, and the Jedi Steps) the score in general from essentially all the new movies lack the musical firepower of the Lucas era movies. Despite their many shortcomings as prequels to the OT, the prequels themselves generated some great artistic content. 

The new movies try to hard to call back to literally 5 seconds worth of a sound byte from the score of a better movie, Solo is especially guilty of this. On top of that, I’m not getting the same umph from John Williams as we did in years past; that’s sacrilege I know, but as lame as it sounds the track to Star Wars a New Hope is like one of 13 albums on phone right now (I’m a loser I know), which is to say that it especially hurts to have basically lost John Williams original fire. In general 7 &amp; 8 just brought serviceable but empty flourishes that ended up serving as background noise instead vs the 80s movies whose score could almost stand as their own orchestrated peices. 

Rogue One didn’t bring much in term of memorable themes, save for maybe Krennic’s (I know that’s diff from Williams). 

All in all Star Wars used to be about the music almost as much as anything else, and in many ways their treatment of the music reflects their treatment of the property: **clean and serviceable, but unoriginal.**

I want a Republic Commando sequel but I'm scared it'll end up like Battlefront 2 is now,"Republic Commando was made during the golden era of Star Wars games, which was 2005 under Lucas Arts which did stuff with Pandemic occasionally, I have no idea if they partnered or rivaled with them, I was tiny and didn't even know what politics were enough to understand that there were politics in gaming like Blizzard rivaling the Command and Conquer people. I measured trends of that time by the quality of the games, not a company's decisions, I just knew that commanding your own stuff was super sick and was basically StarCraft FPS.

And it was cool, the gaming companies of those times actually cared about the final product being great. There was this other game where you piloted vehicles and strafed while taking command outposts and stuff, it was really something else.

When I heard Battlefront was getting remade a few years ago, I was like ""Wow, this classic is going to be revived!"", but then saw the EA logo and remembered what they did to Spore and Maxis and whatnot. Instant skepticism, but I couldn't believe anyone could ruin Battlefront 2, it was inconceivable.

But look how that turned out. Now I look at this other classic and think ""That should get a remake"", but certainly not by EA. The thing I'm scared about is that the idea for a Republic Commando game will float around, get hijacked by EA or maybe they approach a fan project to assimilate into a whole new production, and bam, an instant classic corrupted by EA.

Maybe... maybe Valve could go back into gamemaking and acquire the Star Wars license (or a part of it somehow) from EA and make their own Republic Commando sequel/reboot.

The only way EA could get involved with Republic Commando and guaranteed not screw it up is if they just carbon copy the first game, polish it up and change nothing about it. It'll be a remaster that's $60, you'd better bet it'll be touted as something 'new', but if it's faithfully redone and nothing's changed like Blizzard did with StarCraft: Remastered, there's a chance of this going alright, but I do have to reiterate that NOTHING CAN CHANGE. No exchange machine in the menu where you trade real currency for 13 year old in-game currency, no nothing.

What's Kylo's endgame? (TLJ spoilers),"I figure we might want to try and get back some speculation.

What does Kylo actually want?  I thought he was mostly motivated by his disdain against Luke, but Luke is gone.  Rey isn't affiliated with Luke's failed order and while hunting her down is probably on the list of things to do, it isn't something he started with.

Does he actually want to rule the First Order, or was he just using\being used by it for training?

It doesn't seem like he has the attitude to lead a galactic government - I'm not sure he wanted it in the first place.  I think the original plan was to use Snoke to destroy Luke and then betray Snoke.  Given his tantrums and random acts of destruction it seems that the First Order was more a means to an end than anything else.

The loneliness and devastation from a loss that monumental is not something i can even fathom.  So when just latched onto Finn like a crazy person,  another escaped orphan that seemed to be discovering and understanding Rose's plight, i just cant be too judgmental.  

She was now faced with losing Finn,  in the exact same way she just lost Paige,  and i don't think she wanted to give this world one more inch.  What is she fighting for,  if she can't save what she loves.

I think the biggest example of this is in episode II on ""200,000 units."" Like, what the hell? 200,000 soldiers are the army of a country the size of Turkey. How are you going to fight a galactic war with this? It does not have to show more scenes than it does to reveal the size of the army, but it did not have a conscious scriptwriter to change the speech by something like ""200 million units"", would make much more sense and to give an idea of the size of the Galaxy.

The Thematic Significance of the Skywalker Saber (Episodes IV - VIII),"So, to start, I want to say that I really enjoy thinking about elements in movies like themes, symbolism, character arcs, and other stuff like that. I do this a lot in the back of my head- I'll replay movie scenes in my brain, think about what (if anything) they mean for the characters, and then the next time I watch the movie I'll keep that in mind and apply it to what's going on on-screen. When you're like me (i.e. an obsessive fanboy of nerdy stuff), it's actually quite a lot of fun.

So a few months before TLJ came out, I had a thought about the Skywalker Lightsaber. You know, [Good ol' Blue.](https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Skywalker%27s_lightsaber). Specifically, I thought about what it meant to the story, and what it represented about Luke. And since TLJ released, I've given a lot more thought to it, and I thought it might be fun to share my thoughts and have a discussion about it. Because... I mean, screw it guys. I just really like talking about Star Wars.

Now, I'm aware that this analysis might just be me overreaching or looking for significance where there none was intended. Honestly, I don't really care, because it's fun to discuss anyway. So please, sit down, have a nice glass of blue or green milk, and let's talk about the Skywalkers' Lightsaber.

**Episode IV**

The first time the lightsaber is shown on-screen is in Obi-Wan's hut, when he's telling Luke (and us) about the lightsaber, the Jedi, and Luke's father. As Luke wields the Lightsaber, Obi-Wan describes the Jedi as ""the guardians of truth and justice,"" he describes Luke's father as ""a cunning warrior, the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a good friend."" Luke's possession of the lightsaber signifies his belief in these ideals. From the start, he views the Jedi and his father as all that is good and honorable, and he bases his own desires and moral compass on this. He flat-out says that he wants to learn about the Force and become a Jedi *like his father.* There appears to be no moral greyness here: It's just a simple black-and-white mindset of *Jedi good, Empire bad.*

**Episode V**

The key to the thematic significance of the lightsaber in this film is when Luke *loses* it. And as you all know, Luke loses the lightsaber *right* when he learns the truth about his father. (well technically it happens about a minute before, but my point is that it's in the same scene.) Now this scene in particular is what I personally find really interesting about the lightsaber's significance. If we're saying that the Skywalker saber represents Luke's black-and-white mentality about the Jedi, Obi-Wan, and his father, isn't it great writing that he loses the lightsaber in the scene where his view on all three of those things gets turned on its head? 

When Vader says ""no, I am your father,"" that changes *everything.* Suddenly Luke realizes that his motivation up until now has been based entirely on a lie. His whole motivation in the past movie was based on him idolizing his father and wanting to be like him, but now he realizes that his father is part of the ultimate evil he's been fighting this whole time. His idol is evil, and his mentors *lied* about it. Luke had based his entire self-identity around the notion that his father was a great man and that the Jedi were all objectively good, but now that view is lost, just like his lightsaber. At this point, I think the lightsaber represents not only his simplistic idolization of the Jedi that he lost in the final battle, *but also just how naive that idolization was.* (Make a mental bookmark of that italicized bit. We'll get back to that later.) 

**Episode VI**

Obviously, the lightsaber doesn't appear in this film. So there isn't really much to say here, except for the fact that Luke's scenes with Yoda and Obi-wan in this film only reinforce how much Luke had been lied to previously. Luke does have a new lightsaber though, and that one could represent his more mature and knowledgeable (but also perhaps cynical) view of the Jedi.

**Episode VII**

So the lightsaber reappears in this movie, and in this case it represents not only the previous view of the Jedi being good and honorable, but also Rey and Finn's growths as characters. The first time Finn wields this blade is the first time he is willing to fight for something beyond himself- that something being Rey- when previously his actions were entirely driven by self-preservation and cowardice. His second time wielding the lightsaber shows the culmination of this, with his willingness to sacrifice himself for Rey. (Finn's arc in the next movie revolves around further expanding that motivation, by having him learn that he should be fighting for [the greater good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_q2wBzT6uU) instead of just for himself and his friend, but that's another topic entirely.)

Rey's use of the lightsaber in this film similarly represents her own arc. Her initial rejection of it represents her desire to plant her feet in the sand and return to her delusion of thinking her parents are coming back (and also her delusion that her parents *matter*, but again- that's another discussion entirely), and her acceptance of the saber indicates her willingness to stand up and act in the interest of doing something in the interest of helping others and fighting for what she believes is right. 

In the case of both Finn and Rey, we see the lightsaber represent their willingness to *act* more like what a Jedi should be- selfless, heroic, and brave. And at the end of the film, Rey presents the lightsaber back to Luke, showing that she wants him to reclaim this optimistic interpretation of what the Jedi are. She hands him the lightsaber...

**Episode VIII**

...and he flippantly tosses it over his shoulder and storms off. But why would he do this? Is this just a cheap joke? Was this here just to subvert expectations? *Absolutely not.* And it's here that I'm gonna pick out that bookmark that I placed back in the end of the Episode V section. Imagine you're Luke for a moment. You've felt nothing but contempt for the Jedi for years now. All they represent is failure- they failed to stop Sidious's plans, they failed to prevent the creation of the Empire, they failed to stop the rise of the First Order, and they failed Ben. And now some girl shows up and hands you the physical representation of your previous naive and over-simplified view of the Jedi, and she clearly expects you to immediately reclaim that viewpoint and live it again.

...[Yeah, nah](https://media.giphy.com/media/wt0ddkO9k1150ZelFw/giphy.gif).

Luke's is just *done* with all that. He's done with the idolization and deification of the Jedi, when all they've done is fail. Is he deflecting the blame onto them a bit, when he should be coming to terms with his own failure? At this point in the movie, I'd say the answer to that is yes. But this is is the first of three times he has a chance to reclaim the lightsaber. The second time is right after his little stick battle with Rey in the rain. This time, instead of treating it with disrespect and apparent carelessness, he understands the stakes, and he understands *why* Rey wants him to reclaim that mantle. But he can't. He can't get over this pessimistic-but-not-entirely-inaccurate view of the Jedi he's held onto for years now, but you get the sense that he wishes he could. He still sees the Jedi as nothing but failures, even if he's started to grasp how much the galaxy could use that spark of hope again.

Which brings us to his talk with Yoda. And here he learns- Yes, the Jedi failed. They failed a lot, and they failed *hard.* But that doesn't mean they should just be done away with and forgotten. There are things to be learned from these failures, and one should try to learn from them instead of just letting them define you or actively trying to squash them out.

We'll get back to Luke in a moment, but I just want to take a quick sidebar and talk about the scene in which Rey and Kylo have their little Force tug-of-war with the Lightsaber. Kylo and Rey's arcs are another topic that I could make another long post about, but the short version is that they both have a misguided way of handling their past. While Rey is in denial about hers but also unable to let go of it, Kylo is so intent on destroying his that he's ironically obsessed with it. And both of these characters are trying to take the lightsaber- an item with significance to both of their pasts- but the lightsaber ends up breaking. It's almost like it's symbolizing that neither of them are confronting their past in a healthy way. That there's a middle ground between their two extremes. If you look at it that way, it makes it perfect that Rey is the one to pick up the pieces. I mean, Kylo didn't really have a chance to because she woke up first, but here's an interesting question- if she had left the pieces behind, *would* he have picked them up? Would he have just walked away and let that past die, like he claims he's so dedicated to doing, or would he have taken them, signalling how genuinely obsessed with the past he actually is? It's interesting to think about. I admit that this is a bit off-topic in terms of the themes I've been discussing before though, so let's get back to Luke. 

Luke's wielding of the lightsaber at the end of the film (even after it was destroyed) shows his acceptance of Yoda's words. Instead of wielding the green lightsaber- i.e. the one that represents his cynical view of the Jedi and their failures- he chooses to wield the one that represents his wholesome and optimistic view of the Jedi. The Skywalker lightsaber and the Jedi: both are things that seemed like they were broken beyond repair in the scenes that came before. Yes, the Jedi have failed in the past, but maybe they can be better. Maybe they can become that honorable bastion of goodness that he once thought they were, having learned from their past failures and promising to learn from their future ones. And here stands Luke, peacefully working to save those ideals, wielding the lightsaber and the lessons he had rejected earlier. 

Wow, that ended up being long. But I gotta say guys, I really love talking about this stuff if you haven't noticed, and I really enjoyed writing this, so I hope we can get some good discussion out of it. What do you think? Do you agree with my interpretation of the lightsaber's symbolism? Do you have another interpretation? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I've always assumed that Pryce was created by Filoni for Rebels, and since she mostly serves second fiddle to Thrawn until Season 4, I didn't see any need to give her a backstory (though I liked it anyways), especially seeing how different her book and TV show counterparts are. 

But might Timothy Zahn himself have created the character (which Filoni then used for Rebels) specifically as a new-canon partner to Thrawn, much like Pellaeon from Legends? That might explain why she's given such an extensive backstory in the book even though she doesn't need one; Zahn wanted to give both of his villains backstories before putting them in Rebels.",StarWars,True,1531362303,2018-07-11

My Personal Star Wars Fan Fiction just for fun. Sorry for any errors and all.,"STAR WARS: BLACKENED HEART


/On the planet of Mustafar...Imperial ships land on a docking bay. The Empire's troops surround the ship and allow the passengers to get out. Grand Admiral Thrawn walks out smiling and his squad of Death Troopers follow behind. He walks along the obsidian stoned bridge that leads into the Former castle of Darth Vader. Hot lava flows and pops below the bridge. Thrawn enters the castle and into the medical room. In the center of the room is a large bacta tank, surrounding this is more bacta tanks.  Every tank is occupied by the same person, clones, and of no other than Palpatine. 


Before his death he had used his previous studies of cloning in order to one day clone himself so that whenever he does die one day, he would be immortal. He would transfer his soul into his clone moments before death and get another chance at life. And he did just that. His clones were made to be younger, more agile, with better hopes of being more powerful. 


Thrawn kneels onto the hot floor and awaits his Lord to arise from his slumber inside the bacta tank. The central tank opens and Palpatine exits it with steam now filling the room. Palpatine says, “ Get up Admiral, I am hoping to hear good news from our latest operations.” Thrawn gets up and looks his Lord in the eyes smirking, “Well my lord, good news it is. Our Terror troopers have hmmm...negotiated with citizens of Korriban and have managed to gain intel on our cargo. It is ready for extraction but I suspect word has spread the Empire is trading with the Korriban people. I have no doubt The Republic will try and stop us during our extraction, they know how important it is.”

Palpatine walks and peers out of the window of the castle and watches hot lava flow through the planet. He responds, “Well Admiral we shall get our so called cargo soon and no matter the cost. We can't afford to let the Jedi get their hands on it. What is your plan?” Thrawn wraps his arms around his back thinking of ways to win the upcoming battle. He says,” We send out a small fleet of Tie Fighters in orbit of Korriban.  Have the rest of our troops on the ground. Terror Troopers will scout the area, Death Troopers in close quarters for protection. Deploy an AT-AT on ground. I will work on creating Destroyer Droids also to aid us. The Jedi will put up a fight but we will succeed.” Palpatine laughs,” Good.”


/On the planet of Endor...Luke Skywalker trains Jedi Padawans in the ways of the force. He teaches them all he has learned and more. After the Battle of Endor, the rebels took over and became known as The New Republic. The Republic chose Coruscant as their home planet and Luke chose Endor as his home planet for his new Jedi Order. 


For a whole year The Republic believed the Empire was gone. But they were wrong and found out whenever they were attacked. Luke felt through the force that Palpatine was alive and had made clones. He had to start preparing for the war again, he trained Leia for a month but she could not complete it. She had to go back to the Republic and lead it. Han and Chewie became part of the Republic and landed Jobs as scouts. They would go on journeys to planets and talk the people into siding with the Republic. 


Today, three years after the Battle of Endor, Luke trains his padawans by teaching them to fight blinded, and see with the force instead. Most of them fail the test but a few barely pass it. Although teaching them is frustrating to Luke he still enjoys it and feels like it is right for him. After the training the Padawans go to their homes and Luke goes to his. He is greeted with a surprise visit by his sister. Unfortunately it is not on good terms.


Leia speaks to Luke with her arms crossed,” Luke we have news from our people on Korriban. The Empire is forcing them to give up something they possess. They couldn't tell me what it was but they did mention they had kept it safe in their temple for many many centuries. I'm afraid it is a weapon of sorts and The Empire wants it for themselves.” Luke sighs and responds, “Well Leia obviously they want it. Whatever it is it must be powerful if they want it this bad. What are we going to do Leia?” Leia smiles,” Well I say we need all the help we can get. The Empire had to know we would find out which means they will be prepared.” “No, Leia they are just Padawans we can't risk that,” Luke says. “Well we don't have to make them. We give them a choice, If they want to fight for the Republic then let them. If they don't they can stay here safe and sound, they can do whatever they want Luke you're not their dad.” 

Luke calls his dozen of Padawans later that night around a campfire. He tells them that if they want to fight for the Republic they need to make sure they are certain because they will be taking huge risks. After talking to them Luke asks who wants to join in,  all of them say they want to without any hesitation.


The next morning Luke and the Padawans travel to Coruscant and meet with Leia and the members of the Republic to go over battle plans. Han says that him and Chewie will take care of orbital ships. Leia says she will lead her troops into the fight and Luke will do the same with his Padawans. Han puts a device on the table. He says that it is a Imperial Communication device so they will be able to know whenever it is go time. 


Somewhere in space the emperor sits on his throne, in his throne room, aboard his giant ship called the Leviathan. Thrawn oversees the command deck commanding the rest of the Imperial fleet. The fleet travels through hyperspace and arrives at Korriban, show time. Thrawn and The Emperor board a vessel down to the planet while the fleet sends orbital defences and some troops down also. 


Upon landing, the Emperor puts on his dark hood and walks with his army to the temple. Death troops surround Thrawn and Palpatine while Terror Troopers hide and scout the area. Thrawn deploys small buzzard droids that crawl into buildings and hide until they are needed to attack. The Imperials are greeted by a Sulstan man and he tells them that the package is ready for them. Thrawn smiles and tells him to hurry.  The man pulls something from his pocket and laughs as he drops it onto the ground. It was a flash grenade and now Thrawn and any nearby troopers are stunned. It was a trap. 


In orbit Han and Chewie blast down Tie Fighters and their debris is scattered onto the planet. Luke, Leia, and their army reveal themselves and blaster shots are fired. The light sabers of the Padawans ignite as they run into battle. Thrawn grunts and he orders his men to get inside the temple and hold it down. Palpatine runs into the temple not being seen yet. Terror troopers come out from their hidings and begin attacking the Republic. The buzz droids come out from the buildings and begin cutting apart the blasters of the Republic. 


Thrawn yells for his men to detonate bombs and then suddenly dozens of grenades are sent out into buildings and the streets. They explode and fill the air with black smoak and dust from the ground. Death Troopers pick up Republic troops and slam them into walls killing them. Thrawn fires his blaster pistol and kills many Troops. Luke looks for The Emperor and senses him inside the temple, he pushes through the black filled air and runs into the temple where there is no light only darkness. He uses the force to see where he is and he sees the ancient sith temple. In the center is a huge pit of fire that never burns out. Luks walks to it but senses the emperor behind him and they both ignite their sabers. Palpatine says,” Ahh Luke, do you really think you'll win this war. You will fail, just like your father.” Luke lashes out and slams the green saber blade into Palpatine's red saber. Palpatine laughs and sends his sith lightning onto Luke.  Luke says,” What's so important here? Why cause all of this Palpatine?” Palpatine laughs then uses the force to fill the entire temple with flame to see. He points to a wall and there is a carbonite slab, with a man inside of it. But Luke does not know this man and why he is so important. Palpatine laughs,”Have you ever heard of Revan, Luke? After I killed your father I have been in need of a new apprentice. And Darth Revan will be mine to control!” Luke remembers his research of Darth Revan, all the things he did, and that is wasn't always a bad guy, just manipulated into one, but if Palpatine gets control of him the Republic will be in trouble. 


Outside the temple Thrawn commands for more Tie fighters to fly above Korriban and provide support. The Republic has defeated many Imperial troops but they are beginning to lose their troops. Han and Chewie land and try and help but troops fall onto the ground dead. The Empire is relentless. Thrawn tells the Tie Fighters to drop stunner bombs down and soon 3 bombs are dropped all over the battlefield. 


The air is filled even more with smoke, the ears of the Republic ring, all Republic soldiers are now on the ground with the wind knocked out of them. Death Troopers grab them and line them up inside a building. The Padawans are also tied up and help down. Leia, Han, and Chewie all watch as their troops fall. Inside the Temple The Emperor gets a hold of Luke and begins torturing him with lightning. Luke soon falls unconscious.


Luke is the first to awaken, he sees that all of the Republic Troops are either shot, broken, or being tortured, his padawans included. Imperial troopers carry the carbonite man into a vessel and Palpatine laughs as he walks away. The ships leave the planet and Luke looks down in shame. 


Soon after a man unties the remaining Republic troops and helps get Luke and his Family untied too. He is wearing armor but is covered with a hood and scarf. Luke says,” Thank you but… who are you exactly?” Han gets up and looks at the man,” Oh no...not you.” The man takes off his hood and scarf and tells Han,” Yeah I know Solo. Calm down there's no bounty I'm hunting right now.” The man is Boba Fett with a scarred and dusty face. 


PART II 


After the battle of Korriban The Empire returned to space celebrating a glorious victory. Thrawn and Palpatine bring the carbonite man to Kamino, The Empire has held Kamino in their control and used the planet conduct experiments and build weapons. The Kaminoans will help the Empire unfreeze Revan and help him be controlled in order for Palpatine to use him as an apprentice. Thrawn is told that the process of unfreezing will take days, the carbonite is too old to melt fast. Once it is melted off Revan will be unconscious for days also, being stuck in their for so long will have taken its toll. 


Palpatine leaves the room and asks Thrawn,” How are the other experiments going?” Thrawn tells him, “They are going well. The Hellfire troopers are beginning production along with the Dark troopers. The shadow troopers armor and weapons have also been completed.  Projects 107 and 263 are still a work in progress.” 


On Korriban Boba Fett tells Leia, Han, and Chewie the Empire's Plans and projects. He says that after the Empire never paid him he stopped working for them and has become a wanted man. Han tells him that he is not trusted so he better not try anything. Luke searches the Sith temple is hopes to find some kind of help. He reads old sith books, one reads that after a transfer of a soul into another body the heart of the soul will become blackened and will start to die faster than ever. This is exactly what is happening to Palpatine. Luke walks out of the temple and explains to the group. Palpatine is afraid of dying and is trying to find a way to fix his problem. Not only is he using Revan as a apprentice, he wants any information he can have. Boba Fett says that he has put many projects into play in order to try and fix it also. 


Palpatine returns to Mustafar and enters his chamber, he gets on his knees and tries to talk to some kind of form of the force for help. He hears voices, screams, cries, but nothing to help. He looks out the windows of the castle and screams, cracking the window with anger. Meanwhile far far away from any of this nine beings watch over everything. These beings are known as The Nine Wills. Creators of the force. They send an agent down to Kamino, to awaken Revan before it's too late. 


The Republic returns to Coruscant and meets in the old Jedi temple. Boba Fett tells Princess Leia, “Take my credits. I won't be needing them much longer. After nearly dying I don't want to continue this life as a bounty hunter. Use my credits to get back on your feet and kick the Empire's ass. I'll be seeing you around. Oh, and Solo, take this.” Boba Fett hands over his signature blaster to Han and smiles, he transfers over a million credits to the Republic and leaves,  disappearing for the better of himself. Luke meditates his mind and talks to the ghost of Obi Wan. Obi Wan tells him, “Luke, you must stop Palpatine before it is too late. He will eliminate the galaxy if he gets what he wants. Train the jedi, help your sister, be the hero your father, Yoda, and I would all want you to be.” Leia begins planning for the Republic’s next move. Fett told them that the Empire conducts their projects on Kamino. 


Thrawn sits upon his chair aboard an Imperial ship and stares out into the stars. “What is the end of all of this? When will the war end? The Emperor is trying to wipe out the Galaxy when we need to control it!” Thrawn grits his teeth and taps his fingers on his chair. He is beginning to doubt the Emperor's plans. Thrawn wants to have control over the Galaxy while Palpatine wants to end it.

I just read the Thrawn Trilogy after hearing from so many people that they preferred Thrawn's Empire to The First Order and I had some thoughts of what I perceived to be the biggest difference.,"Recently I've been a little put off by Star Wars and the direction it has gone in.  Understand, that if you enjoy it then that's great.  I'm not trying to hate on fans of the new trilogy or tell you that you are not fans for enjoying it.  I truly am happy for you but I can't count myself among you.  I've heard from many people that the characters of the OT have not been given much respect and have acted differently (I, myself, have not been happy with how Luke Skywalker was handled).  I've also agreed with many people that the lore has not been very consistent in this new Trilogy (even if comparing only these 2 movies and ignoring the rest of SW there's been a lack of continuity that's a bit jarring).  

With that in mind, I decided to pick up the Thrawn Trilogy and I loved it and I think one of the biggest reasons for this was can be summed up in one word... Intellect.  Reading the Thrawn trilogy was fascinating because everyone in it is incredibly smart and clever but not in an omniscient or cheating way.  The books do a good job of laying the breadcrumbs out so that you can follow each person's train of thought and it ends up being one person making a brilliant move only to have another person scramble to counter it and get around it.  Every character is integral and each character's strengths are incredibly clear.... as are their weaknesses.  However, nobody acts foolishly or in a way that would appear counter to their goals.  Weaknesses, do not mean stupidity but rather an inherant flaw in their personality that can be exploited or that holds them back in some way.  Because Thrawn is an incredibly talented and intelligent antagonist, the protagonists must become their best versions of themselves in order to rise to this threat.

This is in stark contrast the The Last Jedi where the plots start to fall apart at slight prodding.  It made me realize that there was a lack of respect for all characters, male, female, alien, human, good guys, bad guys, everyone gets to be dumb.  Nobody on either side acted intelligently and there seemed to be a race to the bottom.  The FO makes a huge mistake so in return the Resistance has to make a huge mistake in order to keep tension up and make it seem like the sides are even.  Then the Resistance makes a really foolish decision so the First Order has to act foolishly in order to avoid taking advantage of the mistake (and thus keep up fake tension).  

Here's some examples so you can see what I mean, TLJ SPOILERS.  &gt;!In the opening scene we see the resistance fleeing the planet towards their only Mon Cal Cruiser so when the FO brings in their powerful guns the logical first move is to take out the ship so that they can't flee but, instead, they fire on an empty base.  Then Poe flies up and makes yo momma jokes towards Admiral Hux and acts like he can't communicate with him and Hux gets flustered by this instead of seeing it for the obvious diversion it was.    Supreme Leader Snoke attacks Admiral Hux (throwing him around like a doll) for letting them escape only for Hux to tell him that they can track the ship which apparently was a huge surprise to the leader of the FO.  Then the Resistance gets mad at Poe for attacking a ""fleet killer"" with a couple of bombers and destroying it because those slow bombers got destroyed by lasers (given their slow movement and weak armor I can't think of how they would ever survive any bombing run).  They then demote him and act in a snide way about it even though in the next scene, the only reason the FO can't shoot them is the guns on the other ships aren't powerful enough (like the giant ship they killed).  Because the Resistance can't come up with a way to escape the FO, the FO now has to act foolish by not coming up with a way to trap them.... like sending a few ships in their fleet ahead of them to intercept the Resistance.  They even recall their fighters back from attacking it because they don't have covering fire from their dreadnoughts even though the fighters had control of the space and were being devastatingly effective.  I won't go through the whole movie (I'm literally only at the beginning) but you can see what I mean.  Everyone acts foolish so in order for the balance to be maintained everyone else needs to act foolish.... it's a race to the bottom.!&lt;

Here's some examples of a battle strategy of Thrawn and how the New Republic responds.  Thrawn Trilogy SPOILERS.   
&gt;! Thrawn needs ships because the Empire doesn't have the fleet it once had, so he plans on capturing NR ships at their major shipyard (This lack of strength also contributes to the New Republic underestimating the Empire).  However, there aren't many ships there so he launches hit and run attacks on various sectors near the shipyard.  The NR responds by increasing patrols and bringing back ships that were damaged back to the shipyard (which is what Thrawn wanted).  Thrawn then captures several remote controlled (or manned) mole miners from Lando's mining base.  This prompts Lando and Luke and Han to seek to repair their ships at that shipyard as well (putting them right near the action).  With the recent attacks, Wedge Antilles is also in the area supporting cargo shipping.  So now the pieces are set.  !&lt;

&gt;!Thrawn sends a cargo ship in with all the Mole miners packed in storage along with 40 tie fighters and uses cloaking to make it seem like the hull is empty.  Wedge notices that the ship is moving slow even though it's empty and finds it weird (scrambling Rogue Squadron to inspect it).  The Tie fighters break out and attack causing Wedge to call for help.  The Shipyard defenses suddenly come under attack by Star Destroyers and are pinned down.  During the comotion the mole miners dig into the ships and the storm troopers on board start stealing the ships.  Lando/Wedge/Luke/Han realize what's happening but their fighters don't have the firepower to damage the bridges of the cruisers.  They also recognize the mole miners (that are burned into the bridge hulls of these cruisers) as the ones stolen from Lando.  Lando activates a signal that causes the mole miners to activate again causing them the then continue burrowing into the bridge (killing the Stormtroopers on board and destroying all the systems of the cruisers.  Thrawn realizes what happened and is disappointed that he didn't get the fleet but doesn't act recklessly or foolishly.  He retreats from the system and the end result is Thrawn failed to capture 51 NR Cruisers but the NR had to destroy their own ships to ""win"".  Ultimately, nobody acts foolishly and each side come up with counters to the other but both sides have to one-up the other side or risk being destroyed.!&lt;

Sorry for the long post.  I really enjoyed the Thrawn Trilogy and the excellent writing made me understand what I feel has been missing with the new Trilogy.  I'd love to know what everyone else thinks of the new trilogy or your thoughts on other great SW novels that I should check out.  I'll probably read some more stuff about Mara Jade since I found her to be an interesting character.",StarWars,True,1531371497,2018-07-12
"Why I think ""Oversaturation"" could be a good thing, but still a bad thing?","I have nothing better to do right now, and I kinda wanted to voice something I've been thinking about for a few months.

Star Wars is based off of the serials of yesteryear. They usually had tons of episodes. Granted, it's a little different, the average Flash Gordon episode was about 18 minutes, not 2 hours, but the idea of a long story told through many installments isn't really as self destructive as I used to think.

That's more what I was worried about, not so much that people would lose interest if too much came out too fast, more that people would lose interest if too much came out, period. My thinking was that once there's 21 movies out (currently, there are 21 movies confirmed, including the 11 canon movies that have already come out), people are going to feel like they can't really get into Star Wars, because they don't have the time or patience to watch over 42 hours of movie just to be initiated. I had a hard time getting into Marvel when my friends wanted me to see Civil War back in 2016, and there were only 12 movies then. Of course you don't have to, you should just watch the OT, and then you're ready to go to whichever movie's coming out, or to participate in the fandom. But my thinking was that people wouldn't think that.

But clearly that's not how it works. The old serials survived that, and the MCU, Star Wars, the DCEU, etc, are all surviving anyway. The MCU is on its 20th movie, Star Wars is on its 11th.

What I think is really happening is that people are just seeing the newest movies. Sure, never having seen Empire is blasphemous, but it means that pumping out movie after movie isn't going to kill the franchise or the fandom.

So should we just embrace it? Maybe not. There's definitely some magic to a Star Wars movie coming out that isn't there for Marvel. Iron Man 3 was just the next movie in the MCU, the Force Awakens was *the Sequel to Star Wars*.

I don't know if I articulated that well, but my point is that Star Wars is not a Cinematic Universe. The Force Awakens and the Last Jedi were the followup to one of the most culturally important stories we have. Iron Man 3, while it was the beginning of Marvel's Phase 2, was just the next movie in the MCU. If we go all in, and Star Wars becomes a cinematic universe like Marvel, then that magic is lost too. Episode 10 will not be as big of a deal as Episodes 7 or 1.

But maybe that's a good thing? If the Last Jedi was just another movie, then I'm sure a lot of the people who didn't like it wouldn't feel outright betrayed like they do now. However I think a better answer to that is to not give one person or one group of people a monopoly on valid interpretations of the source material. Have multiple coexistent canons.  Encourage fan theories, fan stories, and fan interpretation. Don't come up with your own answers to questions, have the fans come up with their own answers, and if they want a definitive answer, have them come up with their own consensus. But I'm definitely going off on a tangent.

Even if it's a bad thing, is it worth it? We might be willing to sacrifice the sanctity of the phenomenon of ""the New Star Wars movie"" in exchange for lots of good entertainment. Maybe not. This is kind of subjective, I just wanted to express my thoughts for why both ideas might be better.",StarWars,True,1531372392,2018-07-12
"""Oversaturation"" of Star Wars could be a good thing","I kinda wanted to voice something I've been thinking about for a few months. Sorry that this is kinda long. I encourage you to read it all, though. This isn't even me arguing that oversaturation is good, it's more me coming up with thoughts on why it could be good, or why it could be bad.

Seriously, though, if your friend wants to watch Star Wars with you, don't scare them with some complicated viewing order of 11+ movies that they don't understand the reasoning behind. Just have them watch the OT and let them decide to watch whatever they want, however they want, whenever they want, if ever they want.

"Han Solo could be be saved in the same way Ahsoka Tano was saved trough time travel in ''Rebels'' episode ''A world between worlds''. Like Clara in Back to the Future III, all are people taken away from their timeline, the moment right before they died. Doubt Harrison Ford wants to return though...","Doubt Harrison Ford wants to return as Han Solo.

But at the same time, I realized there is a way to write Han Solo being saved without contradicting the previous films. 

Han Solo could be saved in the same way Ahsoka Tano was saved, and it would be trough the time travel introduced in the 'Rebels'' episode ''A world between worlds''. Even more than Doctor Emmet Brown's girlfriend Clara in Back to the Future III, Ahsoka  has the advantage of being taken away from her death  right at the moment before it happened, at an unpopulated planet at a place that would be completely destroyed right after hence preventing her corpse from alering the timeline.

A wounded Han, could possibly be taken away from their timeline, the moment right before he died, with alterations to the timeline, due to his death happening  in a place right about to explode. It's also worth of note that Han Solo would be unable to interact with anything happening before his own rescue, due to the risk of creaing a paradox, and also worth mentioning that Han Solo would have to eventually die for real. Only Han's death adapth to this situation, so Luke can NOT be saved. (neither Anakin, due to his corpse being important after his death.) 

More interestingly, this method could also be interestingly used to save Palpatine, due to his death also happening in a place about to explode Death Star II. And more interestingly, Emperor Palpatine saw this realm of ''the World betten Worlds'' in ''Rebels''.  Could this be how his Sith master, Darth Plagueis, prevented the death of others but not his own.

Other thing, that I also, I would be curious about seeing:

Anakin could be cloned because who would not want the person with the highest midiclorian countian count as a padawan (or new body, Anakin's clone mind would be a blank slate, think of how Darth Sidious raised Darth Maul his whole childhood and filled him with his own Sith agenda), as long as the character is properly developed as a clone character with his own personality, instead of Anakin resurrected. And yes, Hayden Christhensen could play the clone.

And then you could have this war between Rey and Kylo Ren, seeking to control the Anakin clone, and the character just not wanting to join either side, and wanting to be the true chosen one. (Alternatively it could be a Luke Skywalker clone, with the Winter Soldier dude, who looks a lot like Mark Hammil). This Luke or Anakin clone, changing everything, could be the ''I am your father''  level TWIST that changes the saga forever. Of course it should be made clear that, no other similar clone can be made.

This would be a clone not seeking to be Anakin, but to be it's own person.",StarWars,True,1531377344,2018-07-12

Were Rose and Paige orphans and ex-slaves?,"I just had a very frustrating exchange in another thread where a poster was pushing a theory that Rose bonded with Finn because of Rose's past as an orphan and a slave.

I have no memory of such a past being in the movie, but it's an intriguing possibility. Rose was always to me a great character concept (a nobody techie in her sister's shadow who gets called into action and is in over her head) which was executed to the point of being botched by the direction and writing. Her actions at the casino for instance come out of left field. In the movie she just suddenly hates animal cruelty to the point of attacking, injuring and probably killing people. A past as a traumatized slave would explain that.

So I'm curious about lost possibilities with her past being deeper than I was aware.

The problem is that the poster in question kept talking about things being obvious 'between the lines', so they never actually got around to telling me if there is some material out there, whether movie or comic or toy desciption that mentions this stuff.",StarWars,True,1531384039,2018-07-12

Discussion: Post Concerning Inclusiveness of EU Books,"So yesterday there was a thread that took off concerning a blog post written here: https://cloakandquill.com/2018/07/11/review-star-war-x-wing-novel-a-far-cry-from-rey-and-the-disney-cannon/. 

The original thread is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8y1l6y/the_rogue_squadron_books_dont_hold_up_next_to_the/

As a big fan of the EU works, this post kinda took me back a little. The author accuses Stackpole of slighting female readers with a young male slant to the book. The author even responded to a tweet about the review (https://twitter.com/mikestackpole/status/1017208886711861248?s=12). 

I think I side with Stackpole on this one. I think the author missed the context of the time the novel was written. The book was intended to be read by young males, and was written to cater to that audience, just as any other product would do. I posted the blog post on r/books looking for some discussion but didn’t get much. 

So what do you guys think? Is this cause for concern? Has the author hit a nerve we hide or is it just something to ignore? Why did he give it 4/5 stars if it’s so biased?",StarWars,True,1531401344,2018-07-12

Old school Star Wars Marvel comics: Any fans?,"The comic side of the Legends/EU is just as vast, if not more so, than the novel side. 

I for one, have a soft spot for the first EU stuff ever created - the Marvel comics printed in 77 that ran for over 100 issues. 

Granted, the sheer novelty of these comics is one of the biggest selling points. It's utterly fascinating seeing what writers came up with because they only had that first film to draw from. They weren't bogged down with continuity at all and were free to simply do whatever, and it worked. 

I adore the bizarre, anything goes whackiness of those early Marvel comics. They are, imo, good comics in general as well. They are often creative, well drawn and well paced. They also retain the voice of the characters well-albeit a more over the top, comic booky voice-but the same voice all the same.

Yoda-Palpatine was a more fateful duel than Anakin- ObiWan. Change my mind.,"[Based off of another [post](https://reddit.app.link/aDYf40SDuO) of mine.]
Yoda, the head of the Jedi Council returns to Coruscant to duel The Emperor in his home court, The Senate. The Emperor has just executed Order 66 and virtually destroyed 99% of the Jedi Order. 
Assuming they fight to the death (not like the movies) and everything else plays out like it did, let’s play the situation game to determine the possible outcomes of these two duels.

Emperor kills Yoda:
        Nothing in the immediate future is likely compromised, but the long-term future for the Rebellion and Luke learning the ways of the force becomes very cloudy. If he never trains with Yoda, he likely never confronts Vader and just stays with the Rebellion fighting small battles in his X-Wing until Vader hunts him down  after discovering the disturbance in the force. Luke is overwhelmed by the dark side when learning Vader is his father and turns to the Dark Side. 
Conclusion: DEATH STAR II is never destroyed, Luke &amp; Vader overthrow Palpatine and rule the galaxy into the sequel trilogy.

Yoda kills Emperor:
          Yoda gains an upper-hand on the Emperor and destroys him. Not only does this send the Empire into an array but also Anakin, who dies on Mustafar without the Emperor to save him. Mas Amedda takes the helm after Palpatine’s assassination and Yoda- Kenobi gather a small army of primitive fighters and slowly but surely wipe out the remaining clones. The Jedi Order slowly begins to reform with Obi Wan and Yoda at the helm. Luke and Leia are still born and are raised in Coruscant to be Jedi. 
Conclusion: Republic continues operating in-hand with the Jedi until the Sith rise again. (Most likely not until Snoke) 

Anakin defeats Obi-Wan
          Anakin, flips off the droid lava surfboard first and gains the high ground on Obi-Wan and slices him and watches his master burn to death before his very eyes. Anakin rushes back to the landing platform to find Padmé unconscious and rushes her to Coruscant in an effort to save her and the twins. Padmé dies like in the movies and the twins are raised on the Death Star and fight for the Empire. Yoda goes into hiding before making one more last-ditch effort to defeat the Empire by facing Vader during the time of Episode V. Yoda is defeated.
Conclusion: Alderaan and Yavin IV are destroyed, the Rebellion is wiped out.

Obi-Wan defeats Anakin 
        Instead of telling him he was his brother and that he loved him, Kenobi gives into his hate and gives Anakin a final blow that will undoubtedly kill him with his lightsaber. The twins are still born and sent to Tatooine and Alderaan respectively and the trilogy likely plays out very similarly to how it actually did without the Luke-Vader arc. 
Conclusion: Luke is killed by the Emperor during the time of ROTJ, but it doesn’t matter as Death Star II is blown up anyways. 

With all this considered, I believe Yoda-Palpatine held much more weight/ significance than Obi Wan/ Anakin.

There's a number of details that I could complain about I don't think there were many things that hurt Han Solo's character arc and place in Star Wars lore but the one thing that bothers me most about Solo more than anything else is the fact that he helped kick-start the Rebellion, or one of a few early sects of the Rebellion. It just doesn't fit the lore of Han's character in the OT. You would think rumors of this scoundrel smuggler's involvement in getting millions of credits worth of coaxium that helped fund the Rebellion would be one of the legends that circulated the Galaxy.

"It's obvious that with TLJ Johnson puts a premium on being surprising, but his particular ""subversion"" is just a smokescreen","Sure, having a ""big bad"" die halfway off is sort of shocking, but the rest of the movie sticks to a pretty well-worn script. Want to be surprising? Have Finn and Rose get beheaded. Have the Resistance get demolished on Krayt. His plot points aren't clever - they're just precision engineered to piss off the fanboys. Any actual appreciation for the craft of writing is absent, with only a neurotic of anticipation about ""audience reaction"" in its place.

Do You Agree? This is the Single Best Review of TLJ Ever Written***,"**Do you agree this is the best review of TLJ ever written?** **He wrote it like two days after the movie came out. A work of art. Original post was on rotten tomatoes.**

What an absolute trainwreck of a movie. I don't even know where to begin. I've tried approaching this review several different ways, but I have so much to say that it feels like I'm writing a novel. This movie is a perfect example of poor writing and should be used in all scriptwriting classes to teach aspiring screenwriters what to avoid doing.  


Like I did with my review of The Force Awakens where I compared it to A New Hope, I think I'll start my review of The Last Jedi by comparing it to The Empire Strikes Back:   


The Resistance (Rebel Alliance) is evacuating their base on D'Qar (Hoth) when the First Order (Empire) shows up. The First Order (Empire) pursues Leia (Leia) through outer space for a good chunk of the movie. Rey (Luke Skywalker) travels to a far away planet to find Luke Skywalker (Yoda), a Jedi Master who's lived in hiding for many years. Luke (Yoda) is skeptical to train Rey (Luke) at first, but eventually agrees to teach her (him) some lessons. Rey (Luke) wanders into a Dark Side cave and has a weird vision/hallucination. Rey (Luke) leaves before her training is complete to help her friends and confront Kylo Ren (Darth Vader). After an intense lightsaber battle (although not against each other), the experienced Dark Side Force user, Kylo Ren (Darth Vader), sticks out his hand towards the novice Light Side Force user, Rey (Luke), and asks her to join him. Luke (Luke) shows up at the end of the movie to try to save Leia (Leia) from the clutches of the First Order (Empire) and she escapes on the Millennium Falcon (Millennium Falcon). Although it doesn't happen at the beginning of the movie, there's also a cheap knockoff of the Battle of Hoth with trenches, laser batteries, walkers, speeders and a white substance that covers the ground (""Salt.""). And it wouldn't be a complete ripoff without the ""Dark Side tyrant leading a faceless war machine with a Dark Side apprentice who has a special connection with a Light Side newbie"" paradigm. There's even a little Return of the Jedi in it because Snoke (Palpatine) tortures Rey (Luke) in front of Kylo Ren (Darth Vader) and then Ren (Vader) kills his master Snoke (Palpatine). They should just call this trilogy a remake of the original, because it's just a slightly different (albeit worse) version of what's already happened.   


This new trilogy lacks originality and sense. They don't seem to want to consult George Lucas, but they have no qualms with stealing his ideas and making them worse. And they definitely believe bigger is better. They take the AT-AT, Super Star Destroyer and Death Star (which were already big) and make them bigger with the AT-M6, Dreadnought/Supremacy and Starkiller Base. So original. Then there's the conflicted Dark Side Force user who has Skywalker blood and the powerful Light Side Force user from a backwater, desert planet. The Rebels defeated the Empire over 30 years ago and established the New Republic. How did they let the First Order get so powerful and not see that being a problem? Was the New Republic just 5 planets that were unrealistically close to each other and its entire fleet was just in orbit around them so the whole New Republic got entirely wiped out by Starkiller Base in one shot? That's convenient. So now the Resistance has to start a ""rebellion"" against this Empire knockoff? Does Leia at any point think to herself, ""Hey. Didn't I already do this 30 years ago?"" This trilogy basically renders everything that happened in the original trilogy meaningless and just tries to do it over (and I don't really blame them because it was great...the first time around). Is there really no other threat or conflict in the whole Star Wars galaxy that doesn't involve a powerful dictatorship versus a small band of freedom fighters? There's 40 years worth of books and comics they could check out since they clearly have no problem stealing ideas! How about stealing ideas that WEREN'T ALREADY MOVIES? How much do you want to bet Rian Johnson's new trilogy involves an outmatched group of rebels trying to overthrow a ruthless tyrant? It's just the same cycle over and over again. And there are too many ""conveniences"" in TLJ where pointless or absurd actions or chains of events conveniently work out. What in Johnson' limited resume gave Disney the impression that he could handle making this movie? The only thing I remember from Brothers Bloom was one of the characters died and Looper was disappointing (and I've never even heard of Brick). What did they see in this film that could possibly convince them to award him his own trilogy? Based on their track record, I think Disney didn't actually care if Johnson's writing was good or bad, they were just happy he fit SJW moments and characters into a Star Wars script. This trilogy's story structure is so out of whack it feels like TLJ is either the end of a trilogy or maybe the first part. Worst of all, it doesn't feel like Star Wars. It just feels like some weird, inferior, alternate universe. TLJ is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made and one of the most poorly written movies I've ever seen. For me, the Star Wars timeline ends at Return of the Jedi.   


Those were my general thoughts on the film. The rest is the detailed criticisms. So either turn away now or strap yourself in.   


It's hard to judge the logic of the film, because it didn't feel like there was any in it. I'm sure most movies have some degree of plot holes or logic gaps when you analyse it close enough. But The Last Jedi had me throwing up my hands in objection several times as the logic gaps were so blatantly obvious.  


At the beginning of the movie, Poe destroys all the cannons on the First Order's Dreadnought making it possible for an attack run on it by the Resistance's painfully slow bombers. These bombers are so impractically slow that I can't imagine they would be used in any circumstance other than bombing things that are defenseless and stationary like a shed. One of the four remaining bombers got destroyed after arming its bombs and somehow ended up blowing up two other bombers, because they fly stupidly close to each other.   


The gunner of the last bomber climbs the ladder up to the main deck where the remote control for arming and releasing the bombs (which is just the same button, so how do you disarm them?...) is located and she tries to release the bombs, but the ship gets hit by enemy fire. So she falls down the ladder (because of the gravity in a bomber in space...) and lands on a platform that saves her from falling to her death (although I'm not sure how she's able to breathe and isn't blown out into the vacuum of space since she was next to the bay doors right as they opened...). She kicks the ladder repeatedly trying to force the teetering remote control to fall down to her. After about a million kicks, she grabs the medallion around her neck that gives her extreme kicking power and the remote finally falls. But she doesn't try to catch it...She watches the remote fall past her in slow motion to build suspense and then she remembers she has hands and reaches under the platform to grab it.   


Most of the 2 and a half hours of the movie felt like the First Order was chasing the pitiful Resistance fleet through empty space. Thrilling, right? It's like watching a sloth chase a turtle. The Resistance fleet is almost out of fuel and can't jump to lightspeed because the First Order designed supposedly impossible technology to track ships through hyperspace. Since the Resistance ships are lighter and faster than the First Order's fleet, they decide to just fly at full speed knowing the First Order can't overtake them. It's a brilliant idea considering no one in the First Order is smart enough to jump to lightspeed in front the Resistance to box them in. So instead, the First Order follows them for 6 hours until their fuel runs out...It reminds of the time Homer Simpson was chained to a tree and was being chased around it by a cop and the cop asked Chief Wiggum for help, so Wiggum sent Lou in and Lou chased Homer from the same direction as the first cop instead of going the other way around to corner him (for comedic effect, obviously). At least Lou had the sense to ask Wiggum to call for more backup...  


But back to the tracking device, Finn and the new character Rose Tico (who felt more like an annoying activist after taking one semester at almost any university than resistance fighter and had a few lame speech moments) somehow conclude that the tracking device is only active on the lead ship so they need to sneak aboard and shut it off so their fleet can escape into hyperspace without being tracked because if they simply destroyed Supremacy then another Star Destroyer would just start tracking them. Why all the Star Destroyers aren't tracking the fleet to prevent a situation like that isn't explained. Maybe they're trying to cut costs on their energy bill. And how Supremacy tracked the Resistance fleet in hyperspace when it wasn't even at D'Qar when the Resistance fled or why Snoke doesn't know he has that tracking technology on his ship, let alone that it even exists, aren't explained either. But I digress. The real question is why doesn't the Resistance abandon the flagship, board the other ships and all jump into hyperspace in different directions? Assuming the tracking device only tracks one ship at a time and since the First Order is only using one tracker at a time because they're energy conscience, they're likely only tracking the would-be abandoned flagship and would follow it until it ran out of fuel. Rose wants to know how they can find the dedicated power breaker to turn off the tracker on the Star Destroyer and Finn says, ""The guy who used to mop it,"" implying he could do it. He said he was sanitation on Starkiller Base in The Force Awakens. This guy's mop and bucket sure got him around...Then in the very next scene when they're explaining their plan to Poe (but really to the audience), Rose shows him a detailed hologram of Supremacy that SHOWS EXACTLY WHERE THE POWER BREAKER IS LOCATED...Guess they don't need mop boy anymore...  


Throughout the whole slog through space, Supremacy bombards the Resistance's flagship, but apparently the distance is too far to be effective. But if the Resistance ships are faster than the First Order's, then shouldn't they gradually get further and further away from the First Order to the point where they're completely out of cannon range (especially after 18 hours of chase!)? Even when they abandon ship for smaller transports, they're still in cannon range of the ridiculously accurate Supremacy. Ever hear of evasive maneuvers?   


And after deciding to abandon the flagship, the lavender-haired Admiral Holdo (who was terrible and also has a lame speech) says someone needs to stay behind to pilot the cruiser for the others to escape and volunteers to go down with the ship. So she needs to stay behind to fly straight? With all that advanced technology, they don't have auto-pilot? Sure lucky she did stay behind, because once Supremacy started to pick off the transports way too easily, Holdo turned the ship around and jumped into lightspeed at Snoke's ship splitting it in half. Pretty convenient she stayed behind unnecessarily like that.   


Although it feels like more time has passed, the story would suggest that   
The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi take place over the course of a few days. So in that time, Rey discovers she's Force sensitive and is already the equal in skill and mastery of the Force as Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker? She doesn't need to even train or try something once and she can already do it just as well or better than Kylo Ren (that's more of a carry over complaint from TFA). And I don't know how long the days are on Ahch-To, but Rey arrived in the evening and left the FOLLOWING night. So the two nights she was there took less time than the First Order chasing the Resistance from D'Qar to Crait which was at most 18 hours. Although shorter days are possible, it shouldn't be left up to the audience to assume that (even though it was more likely, surprise, surprise, a lapse in logic) especially since we're accustomed to 24 hour days.  


There's a scene late in the movie where the Resistance hunkers down in an old Rebel base. As the base doors are closing, a whole bunch of crystal critters scurry into the protection of the base. Why? Who cares. Rian doesn't explain much up to this point, so why would he start now? The critters would've been safer running in ANY OTHER DIRECTION than the base. They serve no purpose except to be an extremely convenient reason for the Resistance fighters to find a way out of the base. Luke's Force projection appears and distracts Kylo Ren and the First Order. While he's outside dueling Ren, Poe comes to the brilliant deduction that Luke's doing it for a reason. He's stalling them to give the Resistance a chance to escape. Why, you ask, didn't Luke just tell them he's going to stall the First Order so they can escape? Because that would make sense. So when they notice the crystal critters are gone, they conveniently spot one that appears to be intentionally waiting around for them to see it. All it was missing was a sign saying - THIS WAY!   


The First Order deploys their ""laser battering ram"" about 50 miles away from the base that has to be dragged there under protection of AT-M6s and AT-ATs. The Resistance uses these crappy old speeders to attack the First Order. The problem is they never attack anything. They're cannon fodder. Poe says, ""We have to hold them until they blow up that cannon!"" Who are ""they""? No one tries to blow up the cannon outside of Finn attempting a suicide run with his speeder. It's like they had no plan at all. Which seems appropriate based on the writing up to this point in the movie. And when did Finn learn to fly? In The Force Awakens, he specifically helped Poe escape First Order custody because he needed a pilot. And since he started this movie in the medbay that he was in at the end of TFA, I don't think he had any time to squeeze in a few lessons.   


Finn's attempted suicide run is ruined by Rose who crashes her speeder into his (which looked like it should've killed them both anyway). Finn runs over to see if she's okay and he drags her back to base. There are two problems with it. One, they crashed right in front of the group of First Order walkers. So not one walker even tried to take a potshot at them? The other is he dragged her all way the back to the base in relatively the same amount of time it took the speeders to get that far out and managed to get past the skirmish between Luke's Force projection and the First Order right in front of the base unscathed?   


All that falls under the wide umbrella of bad writing and so does dialogue. There are a couple moments where it felt like Rian Johnson was speaking directly to the audience, because the dialogue served no purpose otherwise.  


Right at the beginning of the film when the First Order arrives at D'Qar during the Resistance's evacuation, General Hux needlessly gloats to another officer that he has orders from ""Snoke himself"" to fire on and destroy the Resistance or something. Well, of course the orders came from Snoke. Who else would they come from? As far as the audience is aware, the chain of command goes Snoke and then General Hux. There's no one else in between to give him orders. So Hux is basically reminding the audience that Snoke is the leader or something in case we forgot in the last two years between films.   


During the Resistance's last stand, a whole bunch of soldiers are in a trench ready for battle with the First Order's approaching AT-M6s and AT-ATs. One soldier touches the white ground around him and tastes it saying, ""Salt."" Before you ask, no, salt did not play a part in saving the day or furthering the plot. I can only conclude Rian thought with the trenches, laser batteries, large walkers, speeders, a rebel base and white ground, that the scene felt a little too ""Hothy"". So in case the audience was thinking that too, he made sure to point out that the white stuff was SALT, not snow. Thanks for clearing that up, Rian! He could've avoided that entirely by not ripping off The Empire Strikes Back. But since all this new trilogy does is rip off the original trilogy, thinking creatively was not an option. Even making the ground ANY COLOUR BUT WHITE would've made the ""salt"" line unnecessary.   


There's a scene where Rey is brought to Snoke and he's bragging that he can't be beaten because he sees Kylo's mind and every intent. (Surprise, surprise. He also treads on Emperor Palpatine's line about fulfilling destiny.) Snoke closes his eyes and says, ""I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now...foolish child! He ignites it and kills his true enemy!"" While Snoke is saying this, Kylo is turning the saber in his hand while simultaneously using the Force to turn Rey's lightsaber that's on Snoke's arm rest towards him. Then he ignites Rey's lightsaber instead on his own, killing Snoke. The idea in itself wasn't bad as Snoke was right in what he saw, but he couldn't see the finer details. The problem is the dialogue was so awful. The ambiguity of ""his true enemy"" seemed conveniently forced and was odd phrasing just so it could stay open-ended. ""Ahhhh. You see what he did there? By saying it that way, he left it open so that Snoke could be his true enemy. Good thing he worded it like that."" But it doesn't even feel true, because Snoke ended up being such a minor and disposable character. And Ren didn't turn to the Light Side and he struggled with Rey over Luke's lightsaber afterwards and still tried to destroy the Resistance. So Snoke wasn't his true enemy. He was just standing in the way of his ambition. The fact he either hated Luke so much or viewed him as such a threat that he ordered every First Order gun to fire on him when he walked out of the Rebel base would suggest to me that Luke was actually his true enemy.   


A couple times in the movie, Ren tells Rey to ""let the past die. Kill it, if you have to."" It sounds like Rian is talking to the audience through Ren and telling us to just let go of everything we love about Star Wars, because he's going to kill it anyway. I get he wants to leave his own mark on the franchise or blaze his own trail, but does he have to trample and sully everything we cherish about it in the process?  


There's also a lot of cheesiness and pointlessness in the film.   


Rose and her sister each have interconnecting halves of a medallion. Throughout the film, they each touch it multiple times whenever something dramatic or emotional occurs to them or is about to happen. Rose's sister dies in the opening battle, so she had to grab hers twice in about a minute of screen time. Went to the well a little too much there.  


In Disney's quest to kill off all our favorite characters from the original trilogy, a missile blew up the bridge of Leia's cruiser. She and Admiral Ackbar got blown into space where they both presumably died. Turns out it was just Ackbar who was unceremoniously dumped from the franchise as Leia has Force-space-phantom powers and flew herself back to the ship where apparently the corridors of the ship don't need to be pressurized as no one was blown out into space when she let herself in. Watching her fly was like watching a stage play where they put a hook on someone's belt and fly them around the stage with ropes and pulleys.  


Finn and Rose go on a forgettable/regrettable side-quest to find a master code breaker at a casino. It felt like the whole purpose was more about social injustice commentary than furthering the plot. They get thrown in jail for parking on the beach and conveniently share a cell with a code breaker that agrees to help them for a price, but he later betrays them. And BB-8 somehow manages to subdue and tie up three guards on his own. Are we really supposed to believe he's designed to or even capable of accomplishing something like that? I mean, come on. During Finn and Rose's escape, they ride these abused-beasts that are used for races and go on a stampede through the city, tearing it up. It's...lame. The whole sequence on that planet seemed preachy and ended up being meaningless in the end. And the casino was filled with tiny and/or weird-looking aliens doing weird things trying to be funny. Kinda reminds me of The Phantom Menace or the additional scenes in the special edition of A New Hope. Just things acting or looking silly trying to get a cheap laugh. And the master code breaker looked like that suave, greasy-haired, overly-charming, ladies man stereotype you'd see in soap operas or parodies. Finn and Rose were even told they'd recognise him by a certain flower on his lapel. I mean really, come on...  


Yoda's Force ghost makes an appearance in the movie and it feels very out of place. They even used a puppet which was surprising in this day and age especially since they gave Snoke the unnecessary CGI treatment. It was a weird puppet though. His face looked squished for some of his scene. And I guess Force ghosts can control the elements and cause lightning strikes now. I'm sure they would've killed off Yoda too if he wasn't already dead.   


After Finn and Rose were captured during their failed attempt to deactivate the tracking device, they face Captain Phasma and a firing squad that is about to execute them. But suddenly an AT-ST opens fire on the stormtroopers. As the walker moves forward, the top of it is pulled off to reveal BB-8 operating it. So somehow a little, ball-droid managed to climb into the walker and operate the guns and legs. It didn't even look like there was a seat for a gunner to sit in. Then somehow Finn and Rose join BB-8 up where the cockpit used to be. Maybe they have Force-space-phantom powers too and flew up there. The shot of them on top of the walker   
hopping along to a shuttle to escape was just wow...  


I mentioned earlier that Finn went to see Rose after she saved his life by crashing into his speeder. He asked why she stopped him and she said, ""I saved you. That's how we're going to win. Not by killing what we hate. But by saving what we love."" So cheesy. (That would be a good time for that potshot I was talking about...) Inaccurate too. One could argue that in war, you save what you love BY killing what you hate (or the things trying to kill you and who you love). In fact, that's what Admiral Holdo did when she flew the cruiser into Supremacy. Then Rose kisses him and faints because Finn's such a stud. Or maybe because she's near death. Whatever the case, is she saying she fell in love with Finn after spending just 6 hours with him? We got a stage 5 clinger here! Then again, Finn's pretty clingy to Rey too for the short amount of time they've spent together...  


This new trilogy doesn't have a great cast of characters and its villains are even worse. It is easily the worst collection of villains ever assembled. They just don't seem to know how to use them. I'd say the Fast &amp; Furious villains are superior and I can't remember most of them.   


First, there's General Hux. He's a bombastic clown who gets turned into an abuse-monkey, punching bag. He talks like walking propaganda and doesn't exude any fear, competency or leadership. He's a joke.   


Then there's the painfully one-dimensional Captain Phasma. She's the most useless character in the whole Star Wars universe. I really didn't understand her presence in the films other than to be a lame nemesis for Finn and now she's dead (probably). All she did was walk around, awkwardly stiff, holding a blaster in the exact same position at all times. Can someone get her a holster or at least some WD-40 for her joints? What a waste of a potentially cool character.  


The Not-So-Supreme Leader Snoke was another useless and underdeveloped character. So many questions remain about him, but it appears they're no longer important since he's dead (definitely). How did he get his hooks in Kylo Ren when he was being trained by Luke? Where did he come from? What happened to his face? Why does he look so stupid? Why did they use really bad CG when they could've used makeup since he's just an old human? Fortunately, Kylo Ren killed off this cheap copy of Emperor Palpatine so I won't have to look at him anymore.  


Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren was not bad for an emo, cry baby who can't control his emotions. It's mostly his look I have an issue with. He doesn't look intimidating. It would've been better for him to keep his mask on to cover his weak chin, but he destroyed it instead. And I also appreciate Kylo killing off Snoke, because he was terrible.   


Rose and Holdo were awful (and had really bad hair), I still don't really see Finn's purpose in all this, Rey is surprisingly unremarkable and forgettable (like her parents) and Poe is bored just looking for something to do. You could remove any character from these movies and they wouldn't be missed (and you probably wouldn't even notice). Seriously, you could take Rose, Finn, TJ, Maz, Poe, BB-8, Holdo, Snoke, Hux and Phasma out of TLJ and it would have little to no effect on the plot. Didn't really need Chewie all that much either (he was barely in it anyway).  


I guess the best character in TLJ was Luke, but that credit goes to George Lucas 40 years ago. He definitely wasn't the Luke I remember growing up. And even Mark Hamill said in an interview, ""I at one point had to say to Rian, 'I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you've made for this character. Now, having said that, I have gotten it off my chest, and my job now is to take what you've created and do my best to realize your vision.' "" No! You resist! In that same interview, he said that reading the script for The Force Awakens, he thought his debut moment in the film was when his lightsaber was moving in the snow after Ren defeated Finn and was surprised that it flew into Rey's hand because she wasn't even trained. See?! Mark gets it! Luke appearing at that moment on Starkiller Base and Force-pulling his lightsaber would've been SO EPIC!!!!  


I'm not going to say a lot about the comedy. Some of it was okay. But there were ill-timed jokes to diffuse/ruin dramatic moments, weird-looking aliens being weird for cheap laughs, slapstick bits for more cheap laughs and a surprising ""your mom"" joke. Luke was a little quippy and sarcastic. Not that it was necessarily bad, but it wasn't very Luke-like. There is one specific thing I will address though. Taking off where The Force Awakens ended, Rey is on Ahch-To presenting Luke's lightsaber to him. After some emotional facial acting and an epic score to play up the scene as momentous, Luke just chucks the lightsaber over his shoulder and storms past her. I found it a little funny at first, because it was so unexpected. But then as I thought about it and it felt spoofish. It ruined the tone and moment we've been hanging onto for 2 years. It was very poorly handled and not worth the cheap laugh. That's what I don't get this year in movies (especially Disney ones). Throw in as many jokes as possible even if it ruins the moment or movie.   


I can't in good conscience recommend this film to anyone. Whereas The Force Awakens was also a blatant ripoff of A New Hope and had logic gaps of its own, it was at least fun, funny and entertaining (all mostly because of Han) and well-paced. The same can't be said about The Last Jedi. It's illogical, nonsensical, cheesy and uninspired. This trilogy is a pale imitation of the original trilogy and grasping at straws with recycled themes, character archetypes and story. Rian Johnson will forever be known to me as the man who ruined Star Wars. ",StarWars,True,1531410524,2018-07-12

The First Order is incompetent but accomplishes a lot. This trivializes the New Republic and the Resistance.,"This post will only address the 2 movies The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. I know there are extended media from the current canon in forms of novels and comics but I think the main movies should be able to explain themselves instead of relying on side materials.

In The Force Awakens, we see The First Order appears as an Empire-like military faction. They have a very strong Dark side user leaders (Snoke and Kylo Ren). They have a lot of their own Stormtroopers, Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters and a bigger Death Star (the Starkiller Base). They have their own Tarkin-like figure, Hux delivering the speech before firing the Starkiller, killing 5 New Republic planets. They look very menacing and powerful. They destroy the New Republic in like 30 seconds of screen time. 

But somehow this powerful faction has their superweapon base destroyed by the same way the Death Star got destroyed (having a critical weak point). Somehow the rusty old Millennium Falcon is able to bypass the planetary shield of Starkiller Base. I don't know but for a faction this powerful, they probably must acknowledge this flaw and have a system of detecting vehicles landing at lightspeed or something? And then Captain Phasma turns out to be a coward and disables the shield. Why does she even wear that armor anyway? So 3 people just sneak in, capture the Captain and then disable the whole planet shield. Seems way too convenient tbh. Also Kylo Ren, the ultra powerful Dark side user who received training from Luke Skywalker and Snoke and can stop a laser in the air, somehow lost to a scavenger girl who just learned to use the Force in 30 minutes. Also Supreme Leader Snoke is hinted to be very powerful and wise but most of the time in The Force Awakens he just sits back behind the scene and picks up Kylo at the end of TFA. The powerful new Empire with everything better than the old Empire destroyed the New Republic without any effort just to lose to a bunch of Resistance ragtags. Their base and their most powerful weapon got utterly destroyed. So The First Order destroyed in the New Republic in 30 seconds with Starkiller just to have everything blown up on the next day by the underdogs?

And the worst part of The Last Jedi for me is that the First Order does not suffer from their defeat in The Force Awakens. Their base and their best weapon are gone but now they ""reign"" (From the opening crawl: ""The FIRST ORDER reigns.""). Okay it seems like the First Order has more resource than ever and their base getting blown up is nothing. But Hux got tricked into a prank call by Poe. How could the FO recover so fast when one of their generals is that stupid to fall for a ""your mom"" joke. Poe should have been blasted to death for doing that ""your mom prank call"". Phasma is back again and dies again. Also Snoke dies too fast too. Rey and Kylo don't even fight Snoke. Snoke dies because he does not realize the lightsaber has been turned on by Kylo. For someone hinted to be so powerful and wise, he dies in a very stupid way. And then his lobster guards got handled by Kylo and Rey like nothing. And then Kylo lost to Rey the second time, fighting over Anakin's lightsaber. And then Kylo did not even realize that he was fighting Luke's projection. Kylo got humiliated again. 

The new Emperor, Snoke dies because he does not check the lightsaber. The new Tarkin, Hux falls for a ""your mom"" prank call. The new Boba Fett, Phasma, gets humiliated 2 times. The new Death Star, Starkiller base got blown up by a the underdogs again. The new Vader, Kylo Ren lost to the protagonist twice. Despite all the incompetence, the First Order still wins and the Resistance is decimated. Also Kylo Ren is new Emperor now. I guess with this type of leadership, we will know for sure that the First Order will lose in Episode 9.

The movies are really weird. The bad guys lose the battle but they do not suffer anything and still come out on top winning. The good guys win the battle but suffer heavily and at the end still the underdog. The villains lose but they are actually the winner at the end. And the heroes win but they are actually the losers at the end. The status quo is still the same. Another Empire rules the Galaxy and the Rebels are still struggling. This is like a Saturday morning cartoon that keeps both heroes and villains in the same position so they can replay the same scenario again and again.

The Force Awakens the Last Jedi,"A realization I had about TFA and TLJ today is that they are like two parts of the same movie. Unlike the other trilogies where the sequel was about the same characters experiencing a different story, TLJ is just the characters experiencing the other half of the same story.

Poe and the Resistance blow up the big scary weapon, now they have to run away from the remaining fleet. Rey is searching for a lost legend, she finds the lost legend, he dies and passes his legacy on to her. Finn is running from the First Order, he ends up with the Resistance by chance. After spending some time with them he decides to stop running from the FO and chooses to join the Resistance for real. Kylo discovers a force user he has a connection with and tries to make his apprentice. At the same time he realizes his mentor is using him so he kills him. Now he and his new friend can take over, he then gets rejected anyways. 

You could basically take away the opening crawl of TLJ and just watch them both as one continuous movie. There's some tonal differences so it'd be a little rough but not too bad. ",StarWars,True,1531414349,2018-07-12

What's the best way for IX to connect/conclude the overarching Skywalker Saga?,"I think it's by contextualizing the First Order has a part of Palpatine's Contingency.  Palpatine is the main villain of the Skywalker Saga, so it would make sense for the series to conclude with him ""being involved"" somehow.

They'll have to explain that, prior to his death, the Emperor set up a plan to ensure the defeat of his enemies, should they successfully destroy his Empire.  

This could even put Snoke in context.  It can be revealed that he was a Force-sensitive Imperial Adviser (or something) from the Unknown Regions who received all of the Palpatine's dark side knowledge, research, and secrets upon his death.  His ultimate goal was to avenge his Emperor.

This way, the defeat of the First Order is the final defeat of Darth Sidious's legacy.  It would allow the story to truly move forward in Episode X.",StarWars,True,1531415947,2018-07-12

What if the Boba Fett film took place post-Return of the Jedi?,"I've seen a bunch of people saying they would expect the film to take place sometime during his prime and having either to do with a bounty on Obi-Wan or the criminal underworld of Corusant.

But what if it took place after ROTJ? T Morrison is just about the right age now to play an aging Fett. Here's my pitch (The film being rated-R): the beginning of the film takes place 2 days after the 2nd death star's destruction. We cut to Boba Fett slowly crawling out of the Sarlacc Pitt, barely clinging to life, his armor corroded by acid and him weak with no food or rest for days. He finds refuge in the destroyed remains of Jabba's skiff. After rejuvenating himself somewhat over the course of a day and remembering what happened (Being dissappointed that his payday is effectively dead now) he makes a brutal hike through the desserts of Tatooine back to the Palace.

He eventually finds his way back to the Slave 1 and flys to Nar Shadaa to discuss his compensatory payment with the Hutts (He's annoyed that Jabba chose to play with the last Jedi rather than kill him). After reaching Nar Shadaa and recovering for a day or two he goes to meet with the Hutts only to find out from them that they have gone almost completely bankrupt in an effort to stabilize the Empire.

That's where Boba learns that the Empire is crumbling after the destruction of the Deathstar and the death of their Emperor and his enforcer. The rest of the movie plays out like a crime/heist movie (Which if you think about it would make all the star wars story movies heist movies lol) involving a few time jumps with Boba taking a few crucial bounties on Republic officials for the Empire to help it stablize itself until the Battle of Jakku where the movie ends with Boba overlooking Jakku from a capital Star Destroyer awaiting his next mission.

This movie would give even more opportunity to connect the new EU to the movies with him maybe meeting characters like Thrawn, Sloane, other bounty hunters, etc.. It could also serve as way to show the seeds that were planted to create the first order further down the line. Other than that just a movie showing Boba Fett go all John Wick and taking care of business.",StarWars,True,1531418878,2018-07-12

How would you describe the relationship between Rey and Kylo in The Last Jedi?,"I'm not interested in convincing anyone of a particular read of the dynamic here, and am just curious to know what people got from it, since I found the developing relationship between Rey and Kylo super interesting and unexpected. Did you see the relationship as being about manipulation, or did you find it emotionally honest (or some mixture of the two)? How about where things ended - did you see regret there on both sides, or was it just a last-ditch attempt on Kylo's part to appeal to Rey's compassion? Did the development of the characters surprise you? Would you like to see their dynamic continue to be complex and layered going forward, or do you want a more straightforward good vs evil rivalry?",StarWars,True,1531422487,2018-07-12

Can someone explain to me how the Sequel trilogy was not meticulously planned out beforehand?,"I was shocked when I heard that it has been on a movie-to-movie basis. II know that previous trilogies did this too, but I just assumed that with Disney and their all-encompassing control they would all sit down and plan out every single possibility and plot point with everything.

I know they probably plan a lot in a general sense, but when I hear that Abrams just did things without Disney actually knowing the ""truth"" (Rey's origins for instance), that shocks me.

I'm a lover of the ST and I value mysteries and lack of explanation, but if I were going to write a Star Wars trilogy, Id sure as hell know every detail beforehand.",StarWars,True,1531424562,2018-07-12
"The Last Jedi, masculinity, and Luke’s pacifism","Read some interesting opinions about Star Wars: The Last Jedi that really resonated with me. SPOILERS AHEAD.

TLJ is a film about toxic masculinity, about how you have all these hothead men doing bad things for seemingly noble reasons. Finn wants to run away to save Rey; Po is insubordinate because he wants to help the Resistance; etc. It’s ultimately why Kylo Ren is the perfect villain: he’s the stand-in for the (mostly male) fans of Star Wars who subscribe to a legacy vision of SW that, when scrutinized, is not actually accurate.

Themes of toxic masculinity and needing to be bailed out by women, who overall present a far more level headed presence despite having their own duties and worries (both in TLJ and real life), reflect what we see around the world today. 2018 is not as progressive as it should be, and art will reflect that.

Another theme is Luke’s pacifism, and how it actually echoes who he was in Return of the Jedi; he saw that fighting was corrupting him, and refused. It’s in line with who he is, and something I actually forgot about in the original trilogy. George Lucas did right sometimes.

I still feel TLJ could have trimmed some of the excess time in certain scenes and still conveyed all this. Regardless this adds a new dimension to the movie and makes me appreciate it a bit more.

Galaxy of Heores Just Added Bastila Shan and Jolee Bindo,"For anyone who plays Galaxy of Heroes you probably noticed that Bastila and Jolee were both added to the game. For those who don’t play, it’s a mobile game pittin Star Wars characters in battles from all across the saga. 

The game has been primarily canon characters. Actually all the characters were canon except HK-47 was for some reason there since launch. Over the years they randomly added Darth Nihilus and a Sith assassin from KOTOR 2 and a Sith based on SWTOR and a Sith trooper from SWTOR. Since then we have gotten multiple Old Republic based characters. Here’s he list so far.

1. Hk-47
2. Darth Nihilus
3. Sith Assassin from KOTOR 2
4. Sith based on SWTOR
5. Sith trooper (SWTOR)
6. Darth Sion 
7. Darth Traya
8. Visas Marr
9. Bastila Shan
10. Jolee Bindo
11. Sith trooper (KOTOR) also currently unobtainable but exists as an NPC only at the moment. I’m sure it will eventually be able to be unlocked
12. Also an NPC looks a lot like Calo Nord but it’s unamed so most likely just aesthetic 

I find this very interesting. They have been consistently adding Old Republic related things. I know the 15 year anniversary is coming up. But they have been doing this since last year. This leads me to believe that a Darth Revan event is on its way. 

Regardless though, this is the only current made Star Wars content since 2014 that includes legends only characters. I’m not saying this confirms that the Old Republic stuff is canon. But I don’t think Lucasfilms is letting them do this for nothing. This is all speculation, but I have a feeling that there is something planned for KOTOR and Lucasfilms might have a project to make it canon again soon. ",StarWars,True,1531426543,2018-07-12

The last Jedi was the best star wars film,"It wasn't just another fanboys good movie. It made you actually think about the force and it's place in the world. You were introduced to a Luke Skywalker that had learned that the best option was not to blindly rush into a fight just because the villan was ""evil"". 

The Jedi were flawed just as much as the Sith. Both ignoring their atrocities to accomplish their goal for the greater good. No matter which side you were on. You fought and did everything in your power to eliminate the opposition. The force was your tool/weapon to achieve this. 

Jedi or Sith. 

And this is where the real controversy comes in. Luke Skywalker. After everything.  Decides that the galaxy is better off without the Jedi than go and eliminate snoke and kylo ren.  Only by destroying the Sith does once become a Sith. 

And this is the greatest lesson that is learned from the last Jedi. The force doesn't belong to the Jedi or the Sith. No side will win by using it right or better than the other side. Life consists of more than just good beating evil. ",StarWars,True,1531439242,2018-07-12
Why people have a problem with the humor in The Last Jedi but not in the other films.,"Like most people I found the attempts at humor in The Last Jedi to fall flat and thought they seemed out of place, but for the longest time I couldn't really tell exactly why I felt that way. After all, humor has been present in Star Wars since the first film, so I didn't know what was so different about it in The Last Jedi.

But I think I figured it out. The humor in the previous films didn't undermine the villains and make them less threatening, whereas in The Last Jedi, it did. In previous films, the humor was either banter between the protagonists (""No. No. The one I'm pointing to. No. NO! NO!"", ""Someone get this walking carpet out of my way"", etc.) or was directed at villains but they did not react to it.

Compare the opening scenes of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Both involve Poe joking upon being confronted by a main villain, so I think they're the best scenes to show the difference. In The Force Awakens, Poe jokes about ""who talks first do I talk first?"" But Kylo Ren does not play along. He just tells his troops to search Poe and captures him and proceeds to go and torture him for information. In The Last Jedi, Poe pulls his ""Holding for General Hux"" speech, but here, Hux falls for it and it allows Poe to destroy the First Order's weaponry. By allowing Poe's jokes to throw him off, it undermines him as a serious threat to the protagonists.

"Leia, not Poe, should be court martialed at SD Comic Con","Let me preface this by saying I think having a court martial proceeding for Poe at SD Comic Con is a really cool idea, and could help bridge the gap between fans and could inject some fun back into the fandom. Also, the fact that there will be a federal magistrate and a former JAG officer is pretty awesome. I hope the event will be available on youtube. That said, here is why I think Leia is the one who should be court martialed:

Leia, as General of the Resistance,  accepts funding and resources from the Republic for the purpose of defending the Republic from emerging threats. We find out in TFA that she is using those resources in an effort to find her brother. That is an odd use of Republic resources, but it would make sense if finding Luke had a strategically significant purpose related to protecting the Republic. However, in TLJ we find out there was no purpose behind finding Luke other than the abstract concept of ""inspiring hope."" When she finally gets to talk to Luke, she says nothing that would suggest any strategic reason behind searching for him. What could possibly justify Leia using her capacity as General of the Resistance for the purpose of finding Luke?

While she was preoccupied with finding Luke, a threat emerged in the form of the First Order, and the entire Republic was destroyed in a single move with multiple planets destroyed and presumably billions of innocent people killed. Using the Resistance to find Luke while failing to properly identify and respond to the emerging threat of the First Order is an egregious misappropriation of Republic funds and is dereliction of duty of the highest order. For Leia to testify against Poe in his court martial proceedings is a farce, she should be the one court martialed. ",StarWars,True,1531446985,2018-07-12

Theory About Snoke's Origins," Okay, I have a very loose (and exciting) theory surrounding the origins of Snoke.  
What if he's Starkiller?For those who don't know, Starkiller is a major SW EU fan favorite and has appeared in several videogames. He was on the verge of being canon, but was ultimately thrown in with the other unofficial Star Wars fan material.   
It is a rather intriguing thought to consider if Starkiller would indeed be Snoke. First off, let's examine the evidence:

1. Snoke is known to be incredibly powerful in the Dark Side. Starkiller was an efficient and lethal apprentice that, in some stories, defeated even Vader due to how powerful his abilities were, and even became the Emperor's assassin.
2. The timeline of (the assumed) age of Snoke - which is that of an older man - would match up relatively well with Starkiller, who, in most stories, has his spotlight in between Episodes 3 and 4, but before Rogue One and (potentially) after Solo. 
3. The most obvious reason, however, that Snoke was really Starkiller, is that there was an entire planet-destroying weapon that was named after him: Starkiller Base.
4. Additionally, when we see Starkiller last in the Force Unleashed, Starkiller is badly wounded by Emperor Palpatine and is forced into servitude. Starkiller would eventually break free of the Emperor's grasp when he dies, but would pick up a number of impressive skills before the Empire's demise. Following this thread further, Starkiller would eventually wrestle control over the ashes of the Empire and form the First Order, seeing it of highest priority to find and slay Luke Skywalker as his only contestant to his ultimate power. Luke would battle Snoke, and the fight would ultimately end in a draw when Luke flees Snoke after destroying Snoke's lightsaber, which Luke manages to do by removing the kyber crystal powering Snoke's lightsaber, seen worn around Luke's neck in Ep. 8.
5. Like I said before, Starkiller was horrifically damaged when he fought the Emperor. When Starkiller was nursed back to health, he was given a suit of armor very similar to Vader's in function to keep him alive. It is quite possible that Starkiller cast aside his armor once the Emperor was killed as a show of defying his long and arduous servitude, and used the Dark Side as a form of ""life suport,"" similar to how we know Darth Maul did.

tl;dr My theory is that Snoke was Starkiller from the Force Unleashed. ",StarWars,True,1531455082,2018-07-13

Thoughts On Rebels?,"I finally caved and started to watch Rebels and now that I'm a few episodes in I'm kind of bored. I really enjoyed the Clone Wars series and since it's obviously made and written by the same people I figured I would enjoy this one as well. Perhaps it's because I'm not as ""into"" the characters, and maybe that will change as I see more but I'm not so sure.

The first several episodes have shown how insanely inept the Empire and it's officers/stormtroopers are, and that drives me bonkers when shows do that. I get it, you can't have the main characters getting murdered but to have imperials who have been born and bred to be soldiers be so absolutely foiled by a kid with some bizarre slingshot thing that doesn't actually pierce their armor is laughable. 

Maybe Rebels is more kid friendly so it's less my cup of tea. It seemed like in the Clone Wars show there was generally at least a sense of urgency or fear, whereas with this one it's so much more... campy. I don't hate it, so I'll continue watching it (if even just to see ""important"" characters in their cameos), and hopefully it gets more interesting for me.

Can a Skywalker eventually lose in Star Wars?,"Hi everyone, I’ve been thinking about a potential ending to the New Trilogy. Can a Skywalker actually lose? With Luke dead, and Carrie Fisher dead in real life, that means Kylo is the only remaining Skywalker. In all of Star Wars canon a Skywalker has not technically lost, Anakin redeemed himself, Luke destroyed the Empire, etc and Leia formed the New Republic. I’m not sure but I believe I read somewhere that episode 9 is the last story told about the Skywalkers. I’m truly curious about what happens to Kylo (the only decent remaining character in the NT.) Unless Rey turns out to by a Skywalker (highly doubt it) Ben will most likely lose, the “bad guys” never win in Star Wars. So either Kylo/Ben turns (I also doubt because he would’ve turned to the light with Rey after killing Snoke) or it’s over? I don’t know and that’s why I’m asking for potential insight with my predicament. Thank you!",StarWars,True,1531466429,2018-07-13

"If you were to make a storyline about when Luke Skywalker was the head of his personal Jedi Academy, what would be a plot line?","I personally would make a plot line that would bridge the mental state that Luke has in ROTJ to the one he has at the beginning of TLJ.

Largely by taking the route of showing some of the unforeseen consequences of Luke's action in the original trilogy. The storyline I would choose would be the family members of the Imperial soldiers and officers aboard the Death Star getting together to get revenge on Luke.

You could do this from the perspective of those family members. Probably have a few flashbacks of a kid having some sort of skype call with his Stormtrooper Dad while he's onboard the Death Star shortly before it's attacked by rebel forces.

The story would basically be people who see Luke not as a war hero, but a war criminal who is responsible the death for a million people.

Furthermore, I'd also do a storyline where The First Order uses propaganda that tries to deny that the Death Star ever blew up Alderaan in the first place. It could mirror the Holocaust denial we have in the real world, in which The First Order will claim that ""nobody really knows what happened to Alderaan"" and that the Rebellion falsely blamed the Empire in order to garner galactic support.

I mean as far as I know in canon, there's no evidence the Empire blew up Alderaan. Any evidence that does exist vanished when the Death Star blew up. You could use this (as well as disillusionment and frustration with the corrupt and incompetnet Republic government) as a way of faciliationg the backlash and resenment towards Luke Skywalker and his Jedi order.

This would be a good storyline for his character in multiple ways.

1. It ties into Luke's disillusionment. One of his greatest accomplishments, blowing up the death star. Turned out to have unforeseen consequences. He didn't think about the people on board the space station (most of them were people just doing their jobs, not necessarily evil). It would also make him reflect on how even something as seemingly obviously evil as The Death Star is now being sympathized with and the people who destroyed it are villanized. 

2. It can tie into Luke Skywalker's own personal crisis as to how he handles conflict. If he didn't destroy the Death Star, many people people in the galaxy would die. But because he did so, still a lot of people died and suffered. It would tie into his mindset at the beginning of TLJ as to why bother making the choice at all if whatever choice you make is just going to end up causing pain.

One line about Snoke TFA or TLJ,"I loved the The Last Jedi but one of the criticisms of the movie that I understand is the complete lack of background re Snoke.

When Johnson was asked about this, he said it didn’t make sense for Snoke to be discussing that with Kylo or Rey. 

I completely agree with him, it would have been cheesy.

But I think it would have made perfect sense to make some mention of Snoke and his background, even just one line in the conversations between Luke and Rey regarding the fall of Ben Solo.

Though I think you could also argue it was JJ who should have provided this in TFA. A conversation between Han and Leia, maybe between Han and Rey.

I also enjoyed TFA, but for me what I didn’t think it did very well was give us a sense of the situation, the politics of the galaxy.

But then right before the second bomber goes down, there's a guy saying ""bombs are armed"", and just a second later this bomber gets hit, and because they were armed all the bombs explode and the bomber takes two other bombers down with it.  

So basically, there's nothing wrong with their formation, as long as the bombs aren't armed yet.  
It's actually a really cool detail that one bomber goes down harmlessly because its bombs aren't armed yet, while the other explodes with devastating consequences.  

Maybe I'm stretching here, but it even kind of fits with the theme of the movie, about how the focus on blowing up the bad guys keeps backfiring, literally in this case.  ",StarWars,True,1531495031,2018-07-13

Is it safe to assume that Luke spent a good 30 (more?) years training new Jedi?,"Between the end of ToS and the destruction of the order by the Knights of Ren, Luke probably had somewhere between 20 to 40 years of training Jedi.

Marvel's Cloak and Dagger Season 1 Episode 7 Lotus Eaters,"[https://www.moviesfame.com/marvels-cloak-and-dagger-season-1-episode-7-lotus-eaters-watch-online/](https://www.moviesfame.com/marvels-cloak-and-dagger-season-1-episode-7-lotus-eaters-watch-online/)

https://i.redd.it/ru7e4lb2hr911.jpg

No one can ever say that *Cloak &amp; Dagger* doesn’t try to juggle its plotlines – for the third episode in a row, we volley across perspectives between Tyrone and Tandy. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t. In either case, there aren’t many wasted shots. But it isn’t like we don’t have a stage to work with: with Greg’s death behind her, Tandy’s made it her mission to bring Roxxon down herself. Tyrone’s in pursuit of the crooked cop who killed his brother, going as far as to enter a notoriously racist police department himself. And Detective O’Reilly – the series’ wildcard – has started an investigation of her own. Having relocated from the police force on Harlem to NOPD, she’s becoming familiar with the jagged edges of its bureaucracy.

I never want to see R2-D2's origin.,"Was talking with a friend about the Joker movie and how I think he's a character that works best as a mysterious figure you know very little about. It's part of what makes him scary and interesting.

I kinda feel the same way about R2. I like the idea of this little droid having traveled all across the galaxy for Rao knows how long and having experienced so much, but you don't know exactly what he's been through. He's always gonna surprise you with what he can do. And it's always curious, and that's part of the mystique and the fun of the character.

An origin would kinda kill that. Having a hard explanation of how this droid became the character he is would destroy part of what makes him interesting, and limit him going further. We don't really know what his goals are, he's always just along for the ride making friends.

But we probably will get an R2 origin at some point, unfortunately. Everyone always needs a back story to make sense of things. They need black and white explanations. Wonder used to be a thing that was fun.

But if you haven't read it, read Star Wars #36. It's a fantastic issue all about R2 just working his way through an Empire facility.",StarWars,True,1531508397,2018-07-13

What is your favorite piece of nuance in a Star Wars film(s) ?,"
Mine is a slight tie between two pieces that are both in Revenge of the Sith. The first is Anakin foreshadowing (even though we already knew this) that he, Obi-wan, and Palpatine all die on a Death Star.  The second, which is probably my favorite on a certain day, is the reflection of Darth Vader in all the prequel villains;

Darth Maul is a Sith Warrior obsessed with killing Jedi. (particularly Kenobi)

Count Dooku is a fallen Jedi.

And Grievous is a cyborg general.

All of these qualities apply to Vader as well. And it’s something I learned here and makes the prequels so much better to me.",StarWars,True,1531511541,2018-07-13

Did Fanboys (2009) rip off a Star Wars Fan Film?,"Does anyone else remember the golden age of Star Wars fan films between 2002 and 2005?

Did the 2009 film rip off the fan film's name and general concept, or do you think it was a big coincidence? Either way, the similarity is very interesting.

Rey's parents theory while high the other day,"Enjoying some edibles with friends and watching TLJ when a theory about her parents popped into my head. Obviously they're gonna do whatever they want on ep 9, but here's my theory.

In ep7 we see a ship leaving in her force vision of the past, so this theory assumes her parents were not junkers in a desert grave. 

From some of the canon books we know there was a secret compound the emperor had with royal guards as well on Jakku. 

But in a nutshell, (I won't make this long and drawn out), I think the dark side cave showed her exactly where she came from, who her 'parent' was. It was herself. Where in Star Wars universe have we seen beings that look exactly like one another? Clones. I think Rey is a clone.

I don't think she's just any clone either, some serious stuff was going down on Jakku, we know it was a very important place so it's no coincidence she was there. 

I'm thinking she may have even been a clone of Sheev's DNA somehow but I could be way off on that. Plus, the dark side cave in ep5 showed Luke his own face as well, and nobody knew what that meant until the end of the film. I think the reveal will come in ep9.

However, the only reason the good guys won was because Rogue Squadron was there (forgivable because they were there as an escort so it makes sense), and Han was there with the Millennium Falcon and, Lando and Luke. However the latter characters were only there because they just so happened to go to the shipyard, and Lando just so happened to be there and he was the one person in the galaxy that was able to stop Thrawn’s plan.

Meeting Daniel Logan at Comicon,"I can't tag their Facebook page since they blocked me for commenting on their organization in 2015, so I'll only post this here. At Fanboy Expo 2018 (Knoxville Comicon) I had the pleasure of meeting a few celebrity guests: Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine), Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett suit-wearer, ESB and ROTJ), Timothy Zahn, the Hellboy trio (Ron Perlman, Doug Jones, Selma Blair), Cassandra Peterson (Elvira), Charles Martinet (voice of Mario and Friends), Ric Flair, I'll stop there, but you can look up the whole list, I met at least 70% of them. Everyone there was extremely friendly, the guests were killing us with kindness, but the one that stuck out to me the most was Daniel Logan, the actor of Young Boba Fett in Attack of the Clones. When I arrived, I was focused on meeting all the other bigger-named celebrities, and Daniel was actually on the bottom of my list I actually told myself that he was a guest that I could afford to miss, if need be. At every Con I go to, I take my Star Wars saga posters corresponding to the guests that were there. I brought my Ep. 3 and 6 posters for Ian to sign, my 6 (same one) and 5 posters for Jeremy to sign, and I brought my Ep. 2 poster for Daniel to sign. I honestly forgot that I brought it. I had my professional photo op with Ian done with, and proceeded to walk over to his booth to await getting his autograph (Ian and Jeremy's booth were right beside each other, and Daniel's was off to the side.) Ian's line wasn't open for waiting yet, and Jeremy's line had to be a literal mile long, so I turned around and saw Daniel's, and I thought ""ok, I guess I'll spend this $40 that I planned on saving and get his autograph."" His line had 6 people in it, and his area was so small that I was close enough to hear everything that he said. He was super energetic, super friendly, super down-to-earth with the fans, he was making jokes to the fans about how he had ADHD and could carry on multiple conversations with multiple people at the same time. A fan brought a ""Bounty Hunter's Code"" book, and asked him to sign it and draw Boba Fett's helmet. He asked every one in line if that was ok, and they agreed, myself included. He then looked in his bag for about 2 minutes for an ink pen, and he drew it very fast and it looked perfect, the guest had a huge smile on their face, and Daniel was just as happy to make them happy. They walked away, and I was next in line. A mom who has 2 people behind me was on her phone and wasn't paying attention to her child in his stroller. He was obviously uncomfortable and crying, pitching a fit (he looked to be about 2 years old, and it was very hot inside, and they had probably been there all day, so it's understandable.) Daniel walked down the line and (in his New Zealand accent) said ""What's wrong? Are you not having fun? I know that I was never truly Boba, but I still have the heart of a Fett. Do you like candy?"" The boy nodded and Daniel said ""wait just a second, I'll be right back."" He went and got his own personal bag and pulled out a roll of Smarties candy. He kneeled down and said ""When I'm upset, this always makes me happy."" He was still crying, but watching Daniel, and Daniel opened the Smarties as if he were breaking a stick, and they went everywhere. They both laughed and he said ""See? I told you that would make you happy"" so he signed the thing that the woman wanted and let them go on their way, and I shook Daniel's hand and we greeted each other, and he signed my Ep. 2 poster, and I was genuinely excited to have his autograph. I didn't plan on bringing the poster at all, he was in the back of my mind and wasn't a priority of mine, but it makes me so happy that he genuinely cares for his fans and would go out of his way just to make everyone happy. I always thought that he did a good job in Attack of the Clones, but I'll always remember him for what he did yesterday. I also want to thank every guest for coming to Knoxville, Tennessee.

Yes, temperatures vary from Mustafar to Hoth but both planets are still hospitable.

Nor does there seem to ever be a planet that has +/- Earth like gravity.

The Press Is Finally Acknowledging That A TLJ Backlash Exists,"Anyone who has read this sub over the last six months, or really read anywhere at all that Star Wars is discussed, knows that there is a schism within the fanbase over The Last Jedi. You may disagree over how large the group that hated TLJ is, but most people at this point would not dispute that some people really did not like The Last Jedi.   


If you read any media and news articles covering Star Wars since TLJ was released however, particularly during the Solo debacle, you would have been hard pressed to find any mention of trouble within the fanbase at all. In fact most articles went with a position on all of this that was so similar, and used so many times, that it might as well have been boilerplate; ""The Last Jedi Was Well Liked, And Well Received By Critics"", anyone who didn't like it was part of a ""Small Vocal Minority"" who were probably racist, misogynist manbabies who should rightfully be ignored. In fact the very existence of a backlash, or any significant fan revolt, or even any valid complaints by detractors, was completely ignored. 


All of that finally started to change this week. 


The first time it happened was an article in Variety five days ago;


&gt;Mayday! Mayday! Star Wars in Trouble


&gt;Before getting carried away by Disney’s ability to mint money, it’s worth noting that one of the pillars of its film empire is looking mighty wobbly. “Solo: A Star Wars” story isn’t just a film flop, grossing a dismal $354.8 million on a budget of $250 million-plus (not to mention marketing costs). It’s the kind of failure that clouds the long-term outlook of Disney’s attempts to create a Star Wars Cinematic Universe to rival the one established by Marvel. **Given that “The Last Jedi” inspired a lot of fan complaints** for deviating too wildly from Jedi orthodoxy and for its butt-numbing two hour and 32 minute running time, there’s reason to worry that the glow is fading from the franchise. It’s up to J.J. Abrams to recapture the excitement with the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode IX. As it stands, Disney and Lucasfilm are sending signals they’re pumping the breaks on spin-offs, at least until they can find a way to make the prospect of another Star Wars adventure seem more like an event than a money grab.


This was the first time outside of YouTube videos and maybe a Breitbart article or two that I saw someone admit that there even *were* fan complaints over TLJ. But today's article from The Motley Fool (a financial advice journal), written for investors by a Disney shareholder went way, way beyond this;


&gt;Is Disney's ""Star Wars"" Universe Imploding?


&gt;More than a month after the film's release, Solo's box office sits at roughly $350 million worldwide. That might not sound too bad, but with an estimated $250 million production budget and a big advertising push, the picture is now expected to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million. Much of that could be recouped through home-release distribution and merchandise, and it's even possible that these factors will put the picture in the black over the long term. 


&gt;However, it now seems clear that things are not right in the galaxy far, far away -- and that development is close to home for Disney shareholders. Much of the blame is rightly being put on Solo's weak ticket sales, **but it looks like The Last Jedi was where things started to come off the rails.**


&gt;Disney acquired LucasFilm and the Star Wars franchise in 2012 for roughly $4 billion. That move was quickly cast as brilliant, thanks to the $2 billion in ticket sales scored by franchise-revival The Force Awakens in 2015 and the $1 billion in ticket sales for 2016 release Rogue One. Mainline-series-sequel The Last Jedi hit theaters at the end of last year, and despite grossing $1.3 billion at the box office, **it now appears that the picture has damaged the Star Wars brand.**


&gt;In the lead-up to the reintroduction of the Star Wars series, Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams had the goal of reintroducing mystery to the series. In typical Abrams fashion, Episode VII introduced enigmatic plot threads and cliffhangers that left series fans speculating. However, director Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi seemingly cast much of that aside -- dispensing with major villains, questions of family lineage, and some of the series' biggest themes in wanton fashion.


&gt;Major media coverage generally lavished the film with praise, and many complimented the film for its subversive qualities. A case for defying expectations can certainly be made, but it's probably fair to say that many Disney shareholders aren't wild about the idea of ""subversive"" Star Wars movies. It's clear that many fans aren't.


&gt;While The Last Jedi earned the approval of 91% of professional critics on Rotten Tomatoes, just 46% of fans on the website gave the picture a positive score. **That level of audience dissatisfaction likely played a big part in Solo's shockingly low box office take, and it underscores the dilemmas facing the franchise going forward.**


&gt;**The Last Jedi's treatment of the Star Wars franchise and its classic characters confounded and alienated a significant portion of series' fans. Making matters worse, Disney employees and media outlets have at times seemed eager to attribute dissatisfaction with recent entries in the Star Wars franchise to personal shortcomings among the fan base** -- a tactic that all but guarantees continued controversy.


&gt;The old adage that ""the customer is always right"" is a simplification, but at the very least, it's probably not a good idea to take a hostile stance towards some of your franchise's biggest fans. That's especially true when series enthusiasts have played such a big role in sustaining the property's cultural cachet over the last 40 years.


&gt;Even Mark Hamill, the actor who portrays Luke Skywalker, voiced dissatisfaction with his character's progression in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Shockingly, the actor did so during numerous press appearances promoting the films -- behavior that's pretty much unheard of, because media events are meant to present projects in the best possible light.


&gt;It seems like Disney proceeded with the expectation that the core Star Wars audience would show up for its new movies no matter what, and that it could instead focus on broadening the appeal of the franchise. On the other hand, an entry like The Last Jedi seemed to take a more overt political position at a time when polarization is running high, and that issue appears to have been exacerbated by interactions between people involved with the franchise and social-media users.


&gt;In response to some of the controversy surrounding The Last Jedi, Abrams said, ""If you are someone who feels threatened by women and needs to lash out against them, you can probably find an enemy in Star Wars."" There are surely fans upset about the franchise's new focus on bringing in more female viewers, **but there's probably a larger subset of the dissatisfied enthusiasts who simply don't think the new movies are very good.**


The bold parts, in particular, are something if you have engaged in any of the extremely heated discussions here and everywhere Star Wars is discussed onlne you will have heard before, but are something you rarely if ever see in print in the media. In fact outside of angry YouTube videos I've never seen the media say these things before, or even acknowledge a backlash *exists*. If this is something that's going to continue in other main stream press will remain to be seen.",StarWars,True,1530496025,2018-07-01

A cousin you've never met before...,"I watched George Lucas' first feature film *THX 1138*  over the weekend and it was like watching a much bleaker original Star Wars film without any space wizards. 

From the thematic interest in authoritarianism to the film's art direction and sound design there are surprising connections and references that Lucas was clearly revamping in *A New Hope* and *Empire* in particular. 

The chrome faced police-bots are proto-stormtroopers, the audio effect of the radio transmissions could be from the Death Star itself and the future-monks look like they shop at a clone wars supply store. 

The biggest surprise came from an interaction between THX and his girlfriend LUH who tells him they're doomed because she's pregnant with his baby. Fast forward almost forty years and Padme and Anakin basically have the same conversation. 

For someone who as seen *Star Wars* as much as I have, it was like meeting someone I know really well for the first time. ",StarWars,True,1530496807,2018-07-01

I come to this subreddit and I always end up in a bad mood, whenever I see a thread about TLJ. I always end up irritated at myself for even reading, and getting sick of the 'negativity'. But I realised something just now.
I'm not getting angry at those who dislike TLJ. I'm getting upset because I feel awful for them.

I don't mean it in a really patronising way, I'm serious.

Can the TLJ haters stop acting like they’re being oppressed on this sub yet?,"Any thread about TLJ is bombarded with comments about how it sucks, and they’re upvoted to the top. Look at that thread with currently 500 upvotes about what people think of TLJ. All the top comments are about how much they hate it and can’t bare to watch it, how it ruined their childhoods etc. 

I get disliking TLJ, I don’t even think it’s great, but it’s certainly not the worst movie ever made like so many of these comments claim. 

Say you like TLJ? Get ready for downvotes and being asked if you’re Rian Johnson.

Post that TLJ is on Netflix and you had a good time watching it? 10 comments from people who “can’t sit through it”. 

This sub has basically become the TLJ hate train and so many of you still act like you’re victimized and oppressed and not allowed to have an opinion. 

Go for it, you win! You’ve made everyone that likes the movie not want to talk about it here anymore! Because it’s just filled with hate. But stop acting like you’re oppressed. And maybe while you’re at it, stop abusing the crew with racism, sexism, and hatred

Re-watching The Empire Strikes Back... I can't help but treat it the way the fandom is treating The Last Jedi. Maybe Star Wars really is ruined.,"* Why are they out scanning for life forms on a barren desolate wasteland? Even if they did find something... what's the purpose?

* How did the Tauntaun die but Luke survived being exposed like that? Why did the Tauntaun die before Han? Are coats really a better insulator than the fur of a *native life form*?

* Why did Vader blame Ozzel for the Starfleet being recognized? Obviously they knew the probe droid got blown up. *That's* why the Rebels knew they were there. That's why the Empire knew the Rebels were there!

* You're telling me that the firepower of the entire Starfleet can't break through that shield so they have to spend like half an hour sending clumsy walkers across hundreds of yards to blow it up on the ground?

* That ion cannon is OP. It disabled a Star Destroyer. Why is that the only one we ever see? Why not mount one on one of the bigger Rebel ships?

* Why did Han wait years before leaving to pay his debt to Jabba? Why didn't he just take a weekend to swing by Tatooine and deliver the money before going off with the Rebellion again?

* Why did Luke pick up no life forms on his scanner if the Wampa was *right there*?

* Who the hell was piloting the *Falcon* while Han and Chewie were tinkering with the hyperdrive? Leia? She's not even allowed to pilot her own body through space, let alone a starship! Who taught her how to do that?!

* Why did C-3PO say that R2-D2 provided the ""odds"" of surviving out in the open on Hoth overnight, when clearly Threepio, not Artoo, is the one who knows the statistics of things like successfully navigating an asteroid field?

* Why did Han and Chewie fuck with the probe droid? Aren't they *hiding*?

*Why did the entire Starfleet go after the *Falcon*? Why were they so sure that Luke was on that ship? Clearly they were wrong. Can't Vader sense this shit? Luke left on his X-wing completely unimpeded.

Those are the main issues so far at the 40-minute mark. Listen, **I don't want to watch the movie this way.** I just want to enjoy it in peace. But months of reading inscrutable nitpicks trashing the new movies have simply conditioned me to watch these films with a different eye. And it's a fucking horrible eye. Don't you guys realize what you're doing? You're not even speaking the language of cinema anymore! You're allowed to dislike any movie you like, but goddammit, be reasonable about it!

How I would have written The Last Jedi (long version). Part 1,"Quick intro: I really wanted to love TLJ.  I did not.  I think it could have been one of the most epic SW movies, plots, stories ever.  Unfortunately it was not so.  I, like most everyone else that loves SW, really, really did not like TLJ.  They messed everything up from plot points of TFW, to Luke, to its own plot structure and pacing.  But enough of that.  Its in the past.  Here is my rewriting of TLJ.  You'll have to use your imagination, as this is a plot outline and not a story.  (parentheses are my commentary)

Opening Scene:

Roll the SW logo.  SW music and fanfare.  Roll the opening crawl.  (keep it traditional).   

Episode VIII
The Last Jedi
The force has awakened and as a result The New Order has suffered a tremendous loss at the hands of the Resistance.  Now more then ever the galaxy needs the Jedi to return and to restore peace and order.  

Two years have passed since the destruction of Star Killer Base.  Rey having journeyed to find Luke Skywalker has committed herself to the path of the Jedi.  While Kylo Ren has traveled further down the path of the dark side under the guidance of supreme ruler Snoke.  

In the outer rim the Resistance is amassing the largest army ever seen in the galaxy to put an end once and for all to The New Order.  But little do they know of the power of the dark side.  The remnants of The Empire are now reunited under a new power.  One that has not been seen in the galaxy for a very very long time...

(pan down from stars and crawl to a 3 planet solar system and three Empire ships, a Executor class ship and 2 Imperial Star Destroyers, are seen fleeing a larger, darker ship silhouette.  We are unable to make out details of this larger sinister black ship.  The old Empire ships are under attack and clearly damaged.  We see them stop.  And the much larger ship moves in above them, a shadow covers all three ships slowly.)

We are shown the bridge of the Excutor, all crew are dead, but no signs of a struggle.  Two last crew members are alive.  They are the commanding officer and his second in command.  A computer glitch is shown on the main screen.  Then a menacing holographic image of a Hux appears.  (this is like TLJ where Snoke appears and smacks Hux around).  

The Empire Commander Speaks ""The Empire will not yield to you...""  He is then force chocked and dies like the rest of the crew.  
Now Admiral Hux speaks ""This is Admiral Hux of The New Order.  Lower your shields and prepare to be boarded.""  
The Empire second in command of the Excutor is shown looking towards his fallen commander as he types on a screen in front of him.  A lower power reducing noise is heard and a graphic of shield lowering shown.  He too is force chocked to death.  Leaving everyone on the bridge dead.

(I wanted to show how absolutely merciless the New Order is.  And also introduce the sheer new power of the dark side.  TLJ made the NO (New Order) look like fools.  This makes them look like a destructive force for the dark side.  Get ready to use your imagination)

We are shown a massive hangar bay in the Executor.  Thousands of Empire troops and personnel are gathered.  We are shown a unique transport ship landing with two flanking attack ships.  Music swells up, dark and deep and menacing.  Doors open on the transport ship.  Out walks red guards.  Out walks black soldiers forming a corridor.  Out walks Snoke, limping, looking weak and frail.  He stops.  We see him head on, full body at the top of the steps of the transport ship.  He speaks ""My son, come.""   From behind him walks out Kylo.  He has the same mask and outfit as in TFA, but has additional cybernetic implants.  He walks forward.  We see him from behind.  Where he was cut down by Rey he now has tech covering up what would have been his wound.  He is slightly crouched.  As he stands up straight, mechanical hydraulic noises are heard.  Snoke comes and stands behind him and gestures to the side.  A NO officer plays a recording letting all of the Empire crew know they are going to take over the ship.  It and the two Star Destroyers belong to the NO.   We are shown the faces of the crew.  Most scared.  Some defiant.  Snoke reaches out and touches Kylo on the back of the shoulder.   Snoke “My son, who betrays us here today?”   Kylo stretches his hands out to his side.  He slowly starts to lift them up.  As he does we are show a wide angle of the entire crew.  Of the many thousands, some hundreds are lifted up in the air, force chocked.  And dropped back down dead.  We are shown the same faces of the crew, now missing the defiant ones.  Snoke “Good my son.”  Snoke and Kylo return to the ship.

We are shown the silhouette of the massive ship.  The newly acquired ships are slowly moving behind it.  Then it is revealed that the NO has an absolutely massive army of these Empire ships behind it.

(this helps bridge the gap between TFA and TLJ.  Also add some serious power to the NO.)

We cut to a somber orchestral song.   Rain.  Early morning.  We are shown the island where Luke resides.  We see Rey fighting with a seemingly impossibly fast foe.  She crawls up cliff’s, strikes stone, stumbles, falls, uses basic force powers like push and pull.  She is exhausted, flustered, angry, defiant.  She is fighting now on a narrow cliff path, above a high cliff edge at the opening of a cave.  At the bottom jagged rocks and water.   She swings Luke’s lightsaber violently sticking the stone walls.  As she reaches back for a large swing, Luke’s hand is shown gesturing, lightsaber shuts off.  She is distracted by this.  Her left foot gets visibly pushed back by a force push.  The lightsaber ripped from her hands, it flies into the dark of the cave.  She is then pushed further back off the edge.  As she beings to fall backwards, Luke reaches out and grabs her hand with his robotic hand.  

Luke “You must not fight me in anger.  You will never win.”  He lets go of her hand.  Luke steps forward from the dark cave.  A great beautiful Luke Skywalker smile across his face, the a more serious tone as he speaks.  Luke “I sense the force is strong with you.  You are of the Jedi mind, but not of the Jedi heart.   You fight too hard you insist on winning too much.”  Rey exhausted, falls to her knees, rain falling on her drenched body, she looks defeated “I don’t know what else to do to win master.”  Luke “In all of the time you have been here I have taught you the technique of the Jedi, but you yourself must learn the way of the Jedi.”   Rey “What else must I do?”  Luke kneels down to her “A Jedi does not win because of the Force, he wins with the Force.  You must learn not to just use the force, you must learn to become one with the Force. “  Luke stands up, lifting Rey as well.   He removes his perfectly dry rag cloth coat and drapes it around her.  Rey smiles defeated at him.  Luke “Cmon, lets see what Chewy has cooked up for us tonight.”

(There was no reason to start the story right after the events of TFA.  There was no reason to actually show Luke training Rey.  I wanted to focus more on her transition to a full master, then go from there.  We know how the training happens from The Empire Strikes Back.  I wanted to take the Jedi and push them even further beyond the powers of a Jedi master.  You’ll see what I mean later.)

We wipe cut to a massive sun encompassed by a Dyson Sphere (google it).  We pan to a land mass and an island floating above a perfectly round lake.   Filling up the majority of the island is a coliseum.  As we move closer we see what looks to be the biggest crowd possible on the outside of the coliseum.  Towards the inside are thousands of spikes.  As we move closer, at the tip of each spike sits a senator of alien origin.  What I want to show in this scene is Leia being introduced, her spike staying put, but the rest of them lowering.  Shows that the galaxy respects her greatly and what she has to say.   Lei begins by saying this is her first and will be the only appeal to the galaxy.  Warns of the NO and asks that a vote be taken.  A vote to show who will support an initiative to fight back against the ever growing threat of the NO.   Each tip of each spike starts to light up red.  Very few green, showing little support for her.  Frustrated she speaks again.  She simply warns that the NO is driven by the dark side.  “You will not vote because of complacency and selfishness.  But will you vote out of fear and desperation.  Our enemy is not the NO, but the dark side which drives it.  Will you vote then?”   One red light turns green, then more and more.  Until all are green.   We are then shown a montage of large fleets beings assembled from different planets.   

(These are the first three introductions.  NO, Luke and Rey and The Rebelion.  The rest is just simple plot.  I wanted the movie to start off grim, dark and heavy.  This is not in line with how SW is, but I wanted to set the stakes.  TFA didn’t really do that.)

Thus we have a lot of comments like ""Ep8 feels like it finishes the story"" and ""we need a huge time jump between 8 and 9.""

So why not have Ep7+8 effectively be the 'first film' of a trilogy? 
Sure, the episode sagas have always been trilogies, but they've also always had a time jump between them. And with this trilogy being the end of ""The Skywalker Saga,"" why not go out with a bang like an extra movie?

Personally, I think a lot of Ep8's problems stem from the fact that there is no time jump between 7 and 8. With 7+8 being the first part, we get:

- two new saga movies instead of one, to better ""connect all the episodes together"" like JJ is tasked with doing with Ep9

- more time between movies means more EU material between movies, a la Novels, Comics, and 'The Clone Wars' &amp; 'Star Wars Resistance'

- an ""Episode X"" to finish off the Trilogy of Trilogies 

It's true, I'm someone who's preeeeety Luke-warm [ (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ ] about TLJ, and yet still wants a bunch more Star Wars stuff. This just seems like a fun idea to me, and potentially, we could get multiple ""10 Episode Sagas"" like the Skywalker Saga.

A question about Anakins force ghost at the end of ep. VI,"So in the last episodes of the Clone Wars Yoda, guided by the spirit of Qui-Gon travels to these planets who are strong with the force, to learn the secret to immortality. What I got from that is this is why Yoda can and does appear as a Force ghost to Luke in ep. VI after his death. We also know that Obi wan could have learned how to 'retain his consciousness after his physical death' because he and Yoda talked about that in the end of ep. III. So my question is, what is the canon explanation on how anakin is able to appear together with the others, as a force ghost at the end of ep. VI without needing to train for it?",StarWars,True,1530522274,2018-07-02

Yes we can all agree rose and Canto Byte was absolutely abysmal, and so was some of the one liners/attempts at humor. Other than that though, what’s wrong with it?

A Question Regarding the End of Rogue One,"So at the end of Rogue One, Tantive IV (right?) travels through hyperspace with Leia in the plans, and that is supposed to happen immediately before the beginning of the Original Star Wars, when Star Destroyers are on its tail. So what happened? How did the Empire track them?

I ask this knowing that when Jyn was looking for the plans on Scarif, she read that the Empire was researching hyperspace tracking. But I'm The Last Jedi, it was a shock that the First Order could track the Resistance through hyperspace, and the implication was that it hadn't been done before.

So is the explanation that the Empire had been able to track ships through hyperspace the entire time and nobody (including Leia, who only noticed the second time in The Last Jedi) ever knew?",StarWars,True,1530531276,2018-07-02
Leia foreshadowing Holdo’s death,"Hi all! I’m just watching The Last Jedi (yet again!) right now and noticed something in the scene where Leia uses the force to return to the ship:

Does anyone else have it? I also found my ROTS soundtrack, unscratched, in a special case with my ESB soundtrack. Missing the first disc of ANH though. :( I lost TPM a long time ago and my AOTC soundtrack broke.

Minimalist fix of The Last Jedi,"Leia/Holdo/Poe

Leia: strong, trusting, strategic 
Holdo: strong and strategic, but mistrusting 
Poe: strong and trusting, but hotheaded  

•Leia becomes one with the force. The scene plays out as before with Kylo's ships firing on the bridge but when the camera returns to Leia after the explosion, she dissapears as Obiwan does, becoming one with the force.
•The resistance jumps to an ""uncharted"" area, without knowing how the first order found them. They will not be able to jump again, given their resources.
•The resistance is thrown into chaos. The resistance worries a spy had revealed the location of the resistance's jump. Holdo takes command with a clear reluctance to reveal a plan. She is untrusting of the crew and Poe. She is depicted in a much more neutral to negative tone to the audience. We should be uncertain of her.
•Poe should be shown as a hothead (as in the movie) but trusting. He knows a spy isn't amongst them, but he doesn't know how the first order found them. The tension builds between him and holdo.
•He finds out from Finn of the tracker, agrees with disabling the tracker before they re-emerge from hyperspace (the tracker only works outside of hyperspace). He builds support amongst the factions in the ship and mutinies. He never tells Holdo of his plan.
•As holdo is taken away, she shouts ""in the darkest and dying of stars"". Poe finishes ""lies the beginning of a new hope. You have betrayed Leia"". Poe takes command.
•The tracker plan fails.
•The ship comes out of hyperspace, in front of a dying star. The first order emerges after them. Poe knows they are defeated. The crew around him await his command. He remembers Holdo's words. He realized he trusted everyone but Holdo. He runs to Holdo, who tells him of the old base. They agree that Holdo will sacrifice the ship to allow them to jettison to the planet and call for help.
•The remainder of the movie plays the same.

Finn/Rose/DJ:

Finn: In the fight for Rey, but not for the Resistance 
Rose: In the fight for the Resistance, but cannot bear the toll of war following her sister's death
DJ: Has gone awol on the Resistance  

•Leia never has the tracker for Rey; its somewhere else. After Leia's death and the chaos sets in onboard, Finn steals the tracker and escapes via a ""empty"" escape pod to find Rey. As it is jettisoned, he discovers a crying Rose in the pod.
•Rose recognizes Finn and is upset that Finn has gone awol. Finn questions what she was doing in the escape pod. Rose reveals her sister's death and her brief thought to leave the resistance. Finn tells Rose that a spy has revealed their location. Rose figures out that the First order was tracking them. Finn realizes he needs to tell Poe, to at least save his life. Rose wants to return so she can save the resistance.
•Their escape pod lands at the nearest planet: Canto Bight.
•They go to the casino. Find DJ at the casino. Rose is supicious of Canto and DJ, especially when he asks for a large reward. DJ gives his speech to Finn about who profits from the war. Motivated by DJ and his interest in Rey, Finn leaves to find Rey. Rose stops him; she tells him they won't be able to find the tracker room in the ship,without his knowledge. We get to see her show her growing connection with him. She tells him if the first order wins, there won't be hope for Rey either. He reluctantly joins them.
•The remainder plays out as in the movie, except DJ reveals he went awol on the resistance, when he betrays Finn and Rose. Finn is solidified and is now one of the resistance.

Something I just thought of today and can't un-think: Couldn't Leia have moved the boulders to escape from the mine?,"We see her use the Force before in the film, and she is a Skywalker, so is immensely powerful. Given the choice between the imminent death of what's left of her Resistance and a chance to escape, wouldn't she be Force pushing/blasting the hell out of those boulders to allow them to escape? Or maybe she sensed Rey was nearby and she was doing it? Is this a plot hole or is it explained in the novelization somehow? ",StarWars,True,1530535823,2018-07-02

I know Snoke is also dead, but I'd have to think that Luke was more powerful than Snoke. ",StarWars,True,1530537991,2018-07-02

Maz Kanata and Yoda,I was doing some research on Maz recently and I found that she is just as old as Yoda was. I figured with all the years they’ve been alive they should have crossed paths one being a Jedi master and the other being a force sensitive pirate. My question is how popular would a movie or series featuring these two would be? I’m thinking it could take place when they were much younger (100+ yrs) before episode 1 and maybe explain how Yoda became grand master or explain his connection to the Wookiee (they both seem fond of Wookiee’s).

"If Ion Weaponry is so Effective, Why Isn't it Used More?","So lately I've been in a Star Wars mood, so I decided to fire up some movies, and download and play some of the video games. Something I've noticed, and recalled, is how devastating Ion weaponry is.

In Empire Strikes Back, the single cannon (massive as it is, I'm sure), did quite a number on the Imperial Destroyers. In Rogue One, the Y-Wings with their Ion bombs did similar to another Destroyer. In the video games (such as KOTOR), Ion does insane damage to droids and such electrical things. 

What I'm curious about, is why didn't the Rebellion just load up on Ion bombs, cannons, guns, etc--get a corvette with some Ion bomb launchers, and watch those Star Destroyers just be lazy in space. Is there a reason, lore and canon wise, why Ion 'stuff' doesn't take a more prominent place? ",StarWars,True,1530545659,2018-07-02
Leia can sacrifice herself to save Luke AND Star Wars,"A tweet I just left for Mark Hamill: Big fan of your work. I've been thinking about Last Jedi... What if Leia were to sacrifice her life energy to keep her twin from dying in Ep. VIII? If they would save Luke, I think many people would come back to Star Wars. It's more than just a movie. Thank you!

I know Mark Hamill doesn't have creative control over what happens in Star Wars, hence The Last Jedi, but I bet Disney would listen to him now if he were interested. And yeah, the script is done, and maybe they're already doing something like this... But it can't be too late unless they've already considered something like this and rejected it. It would be super easy to do at the beginning of Ep. IX. 

Much of the negativity swirling around Last Jedi and the fanbase has to do with Luke's story, and if he'd have simply not died in the end, I think the reaction to TLJ, warts and all, would have been completely different.",StarWars,True,1530546194,2018-07-02
What's your opinion on the set pieces/action sequences of the sequels?,"One of my biggest disappointments with TFA and TLJ is pretty simple, and one I don't see mentioned that often: there weren't many, if any, memorable action sequences that really captured my imagination or excitement. Not including the lightsaber duels, I'd argue every other movie has at least one memorable big set piece:

Phantom Menace: the pod race
Attack of the Clones: Speeder chase, Obi-Wan vs. Jango, Battle on Geonosis. 
Revenge of the Sith: Opening space battle
A New Hope: opening sequence, Death Star attack
Empire Strikes Back: Battle of Hoth, chase through the astroid field
Return of the Jedi: Sarlac pit fight scene, speeder bike chase, space battle at the end. 
Rogue One: battles on Jedha, Eadu, and Scarif 
Solo: train heist

Then in TFA, the Falcon chase was kind of fun, but nothing new really. I didn't care for the rather sequence, and didn't think the battle at Maz's castle was that great either. And the attack on Starkiller base lacked all the tension and excitement of the original Death Star sequences.
In TLJ, the opening space battle didn't do much for me either, and the battle on Crait ended up not really being much of a battle at all.

I'm curious if other people feel the same way.

A Reminder About Luke's Character in TLJ,"I know there are plenty of folks who dislike TLJ for a number of reasons and they are perfectly entitled to feel that way. However, I have seen a number of posts that declare Rian Johnson ruined/misread Luke's character with his portrayal in TLJ.

The funny thing is, the idea of Luke being in a dark place, having exiled himself to a Jedi temple on a remote planet, and being reluctant at first to train his new padawan as he reassessed his whole life were ideas that came from George Lucas.

Lucas originally planned for this arc to take place in Episode VII, but Disney chose to push it back so that the first film could focus more on Han as a father figure and use Luke as a MacGuffin. You can still dislike what was done with Luke's character (I actually think it makes sense when you consider his two Jedi mentors) but I do not think it's fair to lay these criticisms at Rian Johnson's feet when he was actually adapting something that Lucas himself sketched out.

Favorite Moments in Each Movie (SOLO Spoilers),"After watching TLJ again this weekend, my family started talking about our favorite moments in each movie. This is the list I came up with.

**Phantom Menace:** ET! I loved the movie growing up, so seeing their race in the Star Wars universe totally was an awesome moment for me growing up.

**Attack of the Clones:** The beginning of the Clone Wars at the end of the movie. For this being my least favorite, the whole battle outside the arena between the Clones and the Droids was freakin' awesome.

**Revenge of the Sith:** Obi Wan vs. Anakin Skywalker. Even though we knew that both survived, not knowing exactly how this battle would go was exciting and it paid off in the biggest way imaginable.

**Solo:** The whole reveal around Enfys Nest. I was certain Nest would turn out to be wasted talent along the lines of Captain Phasma, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was the start of the Rebellion!

**Rogue One:** Unlike most, I didn't like this movie. However, Darth Vader's Castle and the entire scene there was legitimately awesome.

**A New Hope:** The Cantina Song, hands down. That's when I got into Star Wars for good.

**Empire Strikes Back:** A bit unconventional, but Luke on Hoth is what sold me in ESB. The realization that Luke will be stuck outside in the freezing cold overnight, I was terrified for him. We really see his character growth.

**Return of the Jedi:** I hated Jabba the Hutt from the moment we met him. So watching Leia choke him was extremely satisfactory.

**The Force Awakens:** Everything that include Poe Dameron and Kylo Ren. I loved how Poe wasn't afraid of this whiny little child.

**The Last Jedi:** Finn and Phasma's duel, despite how little credit they actually gave to Phasma. It was brilliantly shot and I loved it.",StarWars,True,1530557291,2018-07-02

TFA and TLJ Problems,"When first approached about what I thought about TFA my first reaction was that after all this time that has passed since the fall of Emperor Palpatine, there is still a war going on and the Republic wasn't back in any shape of its former self.  The ""Empire"" was still somehow still in power no matter the pieces that were in play to fight against it.  To me there are too many puzzle pieces missing for that to be plausible.  


When a government falls, in much the same way that the Empire did there would be a major power vacuum to deal with.  We all know that Snoke came into power but where did he come from?  How does a dark horse assume the position he did?  In Timothy Zahn's books we at least understand how someone like Thrawn could come into power over the fleet.  He was already in a position of power and simply stepped up and with his power and charisma he pulled more into his camp to fight with him.  That was masterfully done I think, but with TFA there is none of that, just simply, ""Time has gone on and...  SNOKE.""  Hardly believable.  


Another issue I had were some of the longer lived species that survived the short reign of Emperor Palpatine.  How did more of them not join with the rebellion after the fall of the second death star?  We know that Palpatine had them crushed under his heels but after his fall there wasn't that threat anymore.  Sure, there were still Imperial troops throughout the galaxy but without a core leadership at the very top they would have been a lot more manageable to overthrow.  I have a hard time believing that the Wookies just sat back and let the Empire stay on Kashyyk.  I am sure if enough of those small factions of Imperial troops were over thrown the rest would have given up quickly.  To see a power as strong as the First Order just doesn't seem plausible to me either.  I am sure there are many other species that would have remembered time before the Empire that would have liked to help restore the Republic to the ways before Palpatine took over.    


When Han told Rey about the stores all being true, again, with the longer lived species I have a difficult time thinking that they would have just ignored the ""stories"".  Some of them could have been around since Yoda was in adolescence.  That is a lot of history to just conveniently ""forget"".  I'm sorry but I'm not buying it.    


I guess I'm saying that while I liked the idea of TFA, I always had a hard time with the fact that the war was still waging.  And then you add TLJ and how desperate the ""rebellion"" was at that point just to survive it didn't seem reasonable.

**Episode VII

It doesn’t make sense that the rebels defeated the empire only to be rebels again 30 years later.  Replace the idea of a rag tag resistance with a full power new republic. 

As for the first order, make them the underdog this time. Remove starkiller base.  Remove the comic relief from Hux and replace with ruthlessness combined with personality (similar to how Christoph Waltz portrayed Hanz Landa in Inglorious Basterds). 

The Jedi order is rejuvenated, but at the same time the Sith have also grown substantially and this time are no longer hiding in the shadows. They are the leaders of the first order. Have a true light vs dark all out war with Jedi and sith facing each other on the battlefield alongside storm troopers and clones.

Add a deception element where members of the first order have integrated themselves into the new republic to cause divisiveness within the new republic, as a means to create civil war. 

Luke is the HOPEFUL and wise leader of the Jedi order. Leia is the leader of the New republic. Leia is also a Jedi, but keeps it a secret. Her force powers are purely defensive with no lightsaber. She can demonstrate shield abilities, telekinesis, telepathy, force ghost communication, and energy absorption much like Yoda. Han and Lando are now admirals of the new republic. 

Snoke is still the leader of the first order but now his backstory is actually fleshed out. Episode 7 begins with and devotes 30+ minutes to developing the dark side’s rise to power since the death of Palpatine. Kylo is manipulated by Snoke causing him to defect from the Jedi and take dozens of younglings with him who are all turned to the dark side. At no point does Luke attempt to murder his nephew. 

Rey’s origins are the same, however when she goes to Luke for guidance, he sees the darkness in her immediately. After a round table discussion with Yoda, Obi Wan, Qui-Gon, and Anakin, they decide to not train her. 

Disillusioned by the Jedi, Rey finds Kylo, falls in love with him, and joins him. Together they assassinate Snoke and take control over the first order. 

**Episode VIII

Rey begins to receive messages from past Sith Lords Palpatine and Plagueis who further corrupt her mind.  They instruct her to send Kylo to murder his parents Han and Leia, because they can feel the conflict in him and by murdering them would ensure his allegiance to the dark side. 

Kylo accepts this task. The spies that were sent to the new republic allow him access to the New Republic headquarters. Unbeknownst to him, his mother’s defensive force abilities combined with the subconscious pull to the light catch him off guard and he is subdued and turned.

One TLJ Critic's Character Analysis - 6 Months Later,"I want to begin with an unfortunately necessary disclaimer that I will not be entertaining any criticisms of the film surrounding race or gender. I rebuke any lines of thought stemming from misogyny or white supremacy. I fully support every casting decision in TLJ. Please be respectful and do not turn the discussion to politics.

I also want to say that every actor put in an excellent performance - not a single major character is dragged down by poor delivery. Most dialogue is well-written. There is very little prequel-era cringe in TLJ. Kudos to the entire cast.

That being said, the big-picture handling of these characters leaves something to be desired:

**1. Luke**

May as well start with the big one - Master Skywalker returns in his first appearance since 1983 (discounting the final shot of TFA), and fans have big expectations just waiting to be subverted. OT Luke’s primary trait is optimism: he’s optimistic about the Rebellion’s chances, he’s optimistic about Han’s character, he’s optimistic about his father’s morality.  

TLJ Luke is not these things, and that makes sense. He believed himself to be a Jedi Master, despite not having the necessary training, and undertook a task for which he was unprepared. The consequences were dire. He feels responsible for the state of Ben, Snoke, and the First Order. He is defeated.  

The issue with Luke’s character arises as Rey urges him to help the Resistance, but he adamantly refuses. No amount of pleading, on Leia’s behalf no less, can sway him. He eventually offers Rey lessons, but *still doesn’t offer to help the Resistance*. He has firmly given up, even on saving his sister. That’s crossing a line for some viewers.  

Of course, he has his redemption moment in the projection, and ignites the spark of hope. It’s a fantastic scene, very well executed - it’s just unfortunate that fans got so little of the Luke they wanted to see on film. The Resistance weren’t the only people begging to see Jedi Master Luke.

**2. Rey**

I only have one complaint with Rey in this film, and it’s one shared with TFA - too much of her character is consumed with the issue of her parentage. I want to stress that my complaint is with how much time we spend on it, not the fact that she is not of an established lineage.  

It’s very cool that she’s a nobody, because we’re getting to see a Jedi dynamic that we never have. Every Jedi to-date has trained under masters who were trained by the Jedi Order. Even Luke had Obi-Wan and Yoda to guide him. She has a broken Luke Skywalker, who can no longer see the forest for the trees. Rey is experiencing the Force without a master to explain it, or how to control it.  

And to the criticism of Mary Sue, I say ‘nyeh’. She’s no more exceptionally talented than Anakin, the only human podracer at the age of 9. This is the nature of a Jedi, they’re exceptional, the Force guides them - but Rey doesn’t know what the Force is, or where it’s guiding her. She has powers, she sees visions, and none of it is her own doing. She’s being driven by something she can’t see or understand. Cool dynamic.  

The downside is that her driving motivation for two movies has been to find her parents, or find out who they are, or something along those lines - it’s not altogether clear. Last movie she didn’t want to leave Jakku because her parents were coming back, we had the flashback of her being left by the spaceship; in TLJ, we’re still on the hunt, we go in the dark-side cave for it, Kylo brings it up two or three times. The reveal is that her parents are nobody.  

Again, cool dynamic, but we’ve spent too much screen-time on it that we could have been spent exploring the actual consequences of her being nobody. Maybe they talk about it more in Episode IX.

**3. Holdo**

Holdo has the unfortunate role of being a new character acting in opposition to Poe, an established protagonist. Neither she nor Poe handle the situation they’re in perfectly, but she doesn’t have the benefit of the doubt afforded to Poe, being one of TFA’s primary heroes.  

Holdo establishes her authority early, with her line about “dealing with lots of fly-boys like [Poe]”, and that he needs to just follow orders. This doesn’t just establish her authority, however; it also links her moral character directly to her use of authority. If she ends up being a good leader, she will be considered a good character - and if it turns out that that authority would be better placed in someone else’s hands, she’ll be considered an antagonist.  

The film does not portray her as a good leader. While she is under no obligation to clue Poe into her plan, the audience has the perfect information available to know that it would be the right decision. We know that Poe is a hero, we know that there is no risk of a spy onboard, we know there’s no time to waste wringing hands over the chain of command when there should be full cooperation across the crew. We know that, when told the plan, Poe is impressed and supportive. Holdo does not know that, but she has made an appeal to her own authority, with the implication that she knows better than Poe (and ourselves). She has the authority to decide who is notified of the plan, and makes a poor decision with that authority that results in a preventable mutiny.  

An important detail to note is that Holdo is also in direct opposition to Poe’s development in this film - something that the movie itself seems divided on. It tells us at every opportunity that Poe’s arc in TLJ is learning to become a leader. Leia burns him early on, “there were a lot of soldiers, but no leaders [in the dreadnought run]”. We see him take on a position of leadership during the mutiny. His triumphant moment is his “follow me” in the Crait cave; everyone looks to Leia, “what are you looking at me for?” - Poe is still ignoring the chain of command, but has become the leader he was supposed to be, and deserves to have authority.  

But the movie shows us something different: Poe needed to learn to follow. He needed to follow Leia’s orders on the dreadnought run. He needed to follow Holdo’s orders during the chase. He needed to learn the blood price that his hot-headedness had cost the Resistance. Holdo would be a great character in a story about Poe learning to follow orders - instead, she’s an antagonist in a story about Poe learning to lead regardless of chain of command.  

Plus, everything she did should have been Ackbar, but Disney won’t give a decent role to an alien not named Chewie.

**4. Finn + Rose**

It’s pointless to discuss one without the other, and that’s part of the problem. Neither character has any opportunity to shine because they’re both so wrapped up in each other - even though there’s nothing on-screen to support a blooming romance (maybe this is just me? did the kiss feel out of place to anyone else?).  

Finn really gets the short end of the stick here. He’s stuck being the bewildered self-insert on Rose’s tour of Canto Bight. There’s slave children being physically abused and he doesn’t think twice about it once he and Rose are on spacehorseback. He says it felt good to “make those people hurt” - I wonder if he’s talking about the colossal beating the child slaves are going to get for freeing all those horses.  

Meanwhile, Rose is really taking the death of her sister super well since she met Finn. She went from stunning deserters to AWOL within an hour. Still suspiciously silent about the child slaves, despite giving an impassioned monologue about the bad guys taking everything she and her sister had over the visual of the child slaves being threatened.  

Then there’s the crash-and-kiss. Poor Finn just has no agency at all. I thought he had a weak role in the film, but at least he got to have his shining mome- nevermind. A romance materializes out of thin air to stop Finn from saving the Resistance. Something something, “protect what we love”. He was protecting what he loved; if Luke hadn’t shown up, she would have just doomed the Resistance. Nevermind that the crash could have killed either or both of them. It’s just bonkers all around. Finn’s bromance with Poe was realer than this mess.

**5. Conclusion**

TLJ is a great movie about Rey, Luke and Kylo executed wonderfully, weighed down by every moment not spent on those characters. Poe, Finn, Rose, Holdo and Leia amount to one jumbled sideshow that'd be better left out, if not for three of our core heroes being participants. Rose and Holdo get the majority of criticism by virtue of being new, unproven characters; Finn and Poe have just as weak (if not weaker) of stories in TLJ, but they're still batting .500 in the trilogy - something Rose may still aspire to, but Holdo can never reach.  

In my opinion, Rose and Holdo are both indicative of the biggest problem for the movie: Johnson didn't know what to do with Leia, Poe or Finn, and so invented new characters to keep them occupied for the 2.5hr running time. Our heroes don't get to have their moment, and the new characters are so wholly defined by their occupation of our established heroes' storylines that they don't get theirs either. The whole movie is weaker for it - especially considering that Finn and Poe didn't *need* new characters to keep them occupied, they already have the best chemistry of any two characters on-screen.

If there are no Sith, in what way does balance need to be brought to the force? Was it just an older prophecy that only a few held to but most ignored? Or was it an important part of Jedi teachings?

Does Rey have Cancer?,"""Darkness rises and light to meet it. I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the light would rise."" - Snoke

Maybe I'm wrong, but this quote implies that as Ren grew stronger with the force so would Rey. Now Kylo Ren (Ben Solo) is a Skywalker by lineage and would presumably have a high Midichlorian count (M-count). Gripe about it all you want, they are canon and there for must be taken into account. In this discussion I believe the best way to account for them is a measure of one's potential with the force. 

Traditionally a Force Sensitive grows stronger in the force via meditation with mental and physical training. Ren, Luke and Anikin all went through this to obtain a higher potential with the force via their M-count. Rey on the other hand has basically done nothing, when compared to anyone else, to achieve a stronger connection to the force yet her strength in it has exponentially grown.

So to sum it up to the title, does she have some forms of disease (like cancer) that is making her M-count sky rocket? I mean it's not like we can chalk it up to poor writing or anything.

Disclaimer: I should not need to say this but we're in 2018 and people get offended by the color of straws. I am in no way making light of cancer or cancer related illnesses. Cancer sucks. End of discussion. ",StarWars,True,1530566212,2018-07-02

"An Examination of Luke Skywalker (1/3) - Luke Skywalker was a good person, but not a good Jedi.","Hey! This is me wanting to write my own character analysis of Luke Skywalker that's been on my mind for the last few days and I just needed someplace to discuss with it other people. So I hope you read this until the end and give me your feedback. So without further ado lets get this analysis started.


Luke Skywalker is the secret love child of Darth Vader and was raised by foster parents on Tatooine. He's always wanted more out of life other then just being a moisture farmer and even wanted to join the Imperial Academy to be a pilot for the Empire, but his foster parents keep tying him down to his boring life on the desert planet.

Things change when he encounters R2D2 who has a secret message for Obi-Wan. After that, a series of events leads him into joining the rebellion against the Empire and him becoming one of the galaxy's most famous and powerful Jedi.

The original trilogy is very optimistic and portrays Luke Skywalker in a very heroic light. However, I believe that there is another valid perspective on Luke Skywalker. One that is far more critical of his actions and of his character.

Luke Skywalker is impulsive. When he goes to train with Yoda on Dagobah, his first encounter with the Jedi Master is frustration. He finds Yoda to be aggravating and not at all what he expected. Yoda likewise doesn't consider Luke to be a good candidate to be a Jedi due to his impulsive and reckless nature. But thanks to the convincing of Obi-Wan's ghost, he relents and begins to train Luke.

Luke pauses this training however, when he discovers that his friends are captured and being tortured by Darth Vader on Cloud City. Against Yoda's warnings, he goes to Cloud City to rescue his friends and confront Vader.

He manages to help rescue his friends, but in his battle with Vader he loses badly and has his hand chopped off. He finds out that Vader is his biological father and he manages to narrowly escape by jumping off the station and making his way outside the floating city, where he contacts Leia telepathically to come help him.

Luke Skywalker has shown his impulsive nature by trying to fight an opponent clearly more skilled then he is and against the wishes of his wiser master. If it wasn't for Vader wanting Luke to join him, the Sith lord could have easily killed him.

Now lets go to the plot of Return of the Jedi. Luke Skywalker confronts Jabba in an attempt to rescue Han Solo. He threatens Jabba's life and in response Jabba tries to have him executed. The situation escalates and results in Luke Skywalker cutting down Jabba's mercenaries, finally rescuing Han Solo, and Leia herself choking Jabba to death.

We then go to the next critical plot point of Luke. His 2nd confrontation with Vader and The Emperor. Obi-Wan and Yoda both tell Luke that he must confront and kill Vader. Luke disagrees, believing that there is still good in him.

He lets himself get captured and Vader escorts him to the the throne room onboard the 2nd Death Star where Paplatine tries to get Luke to join the Dark Side. Vader and Luke fight against each other once again. Luke is at first unwilling to fight each other, until Vader threatening to convert Leia to the Dark Side enrages him and he lashes out at Vader. Luke overcomes Vader, chopping off his hand. But before he can do the finishing blow, he notices that Vader's robotic hand. Just like his. This calms Luke down as he realizes that he was close to joining the same path Vader took and tosses his lightsaber to the ground. He refuses to kill Vader in hatred. 

After that you know what happens. Paplatine shocks him with lightning, Vader picks Palpatine up and throws him off a cliff, redeemed when he heard Luke's cries as he was being electrocuted to death, and ultimately giving his life to save his son, etc, etc,.

So why did I bring all this up? Because my perspective is that Luke Skywalker was in the wrong and ultimately he never grew out of being the impulsive, irresponsible, and somewhat self-centered kid he was back on Tatooine. 

Now before you down vote me, let me explain. The purpose of a Jedi is to act within the greater good. Personal attachment and desires come 2nd to what is best for the people of the galaxy and that balance is always the goal.

Luke has always acted out not on what's best for the galaxy, but what is in his own best interest. He joins the Rebellion out of revenge for his Uncle and Aunt being murdered by Stormtroopers. He becomes a Jedi in the first place to become stronger and more powerful. He confronts Vader, instead of completing his training, because he wants to save his friends (even though the entire future of the Jedi rest on his shoulders and it was against the wisdom of his master). 

However, Luke never learned to stop being impulsive. He ultimately did end up saving his friends (Han Solo took an extra year, but ultimately everything worked out). The only thing Luke lost was his hand, which was replaced by a cool robotic one. Furthermore, his impulsive nature gained him the knowledge that his masters were hiding from him, his father was alive and it was Darth Vader.

Luke's impulsive nature doesn't improve in ROTJ. When he confronts Jabba, he doesn't really try and see if they can broke a deal. In fact he's almost quite belligerent for a Jedi. Wouldn't it make more sense for him to have offered to do some task or trade some good for Han Solo's life? This is the rebellion. Jabba the Hutt is a businessman. Violence should be the last tool that a Jedi uses, not the first. Diplomacy is the greatest tool and first approach of a Jedi. Luke's attempt to use diplomacy with Jabba was not good at all. 


Luke's views on Vader and their confrontation also shows his flaws as a Jedi. A Jedi is Unitarian to a fault. The good of all, comes before the good of one. Luke as a Jedi, should not be risking so much to convert Vader. Even if there is good in Vader, that's not relevant to what he must do as his responsibility as a Jedi. His responsibility is to defeat the Sith and to continue the teachings of the order. Instead he risks his life, risks the legacy of the Jedi, and is even tempted to the dark side, all in an attempt to convert Vader. 

A Jedi should have not tried to confront Vader in such a situation. They would have worked with the rebellion to get the 2nd Death Star destroyed and confronted Vader and Emperor Palpatine on the best terms possible.

While Luke's plan ended up working in the end, there was a very high chance it could have resulted in the end of the Jedi as we know it. Not to mention the fact that Vader and Paplatine could have escaped, tracked down the rest of the rebellion, and the lives of his friends and allies would be lost, with no Jedi left to help fight against the Sith.

Luke didn't act in the way that his responsibility as a Jedi dictated he should. He did what he wanted to do. Like he always has. He shirks his responsibility as a Jedi for his own selfish desire to redeem his father just because he senses his father isn't completely evil. But that's not a good enough reason for a Jedi. Luke has taken lives before. Not every Stormcloak or Jabba thug he's killed was some sort of evil monster. They likely had good in them as well, their own loved ones, their own families. Luke cannot arbitrarily decide which life is worth saving and which isn't based on if he has a personal connection to that life. That isn't the Jedi way and it's a selfish way to approach the taking of life.

But this is where Luke's character becomes interesting. Because despite all that I said, Luke's actions work out. Vader is reedeemed and him and Palpatine are now dead. The Jedi order is reborn. The Empire is defeated. From Luke's perspectives, all of the actions he had taken were correct because they all worked out in the end.

Except the problem with that logic is that just because a plan works out, doesn't mean it was inherently a good plan. Luke never had to learn from the mistakes of his selfish, impulsive, and irresponsible behavior. From his perspective, that's the way the Jedi should handle conflicts and situations.

This is why the Luke we see in The Last Jedi is so bitter and ultimately why he failed in his training of Ben Solo/Kylo Ren. Kylo is essentially following the same underlying logic that Luke used in the original trilogy. He's impulsive, irresponsible, and selfish. Kylo does what he wants and what he believes is best, even if told by those wiser then him that he is doing the wrong action. Even if actions do not have the greater good in mind. Kylo is a twisted version of Luke Skywalker's approach to life and conflict. 

I believe that Luke himself realized this and that's why he was so hopeless when we see him on Ahch-To. Luke has just seen his entire worldview shattered. His entire approach to life has finally backfired on him. Luke doesn't know what the right action to do anymore. The traditional Jedi ways resulted in the rise of the Empire and Darth Vader. His own approach resulted in the rise of The First Order and Kylo Ren. When people don't know what philosophy they should take, they often retreat inward. Which is what Luke did. He went to the first sight of the Jedi temple for some sort of insight of what he should do, but none came. Because not even the wisdom of previous Jedi could guide him in this current path. So he stayed there. Convinced that there is nothing more he could offer the galaxy.

This was a concept he tried to teach to Rey. That the Jedi teachings are flawed, that his own teachings are flawed, and that there is nothing to be done but to simply trust in The Force and let it sort itself out. It wasn't until Yoda came to him in his moment of deepest frustration and desperation that he realized the truth.

Failure isn't the end. Luke is a character who is used to certainty. He may get his ass kicked in a fight. But he always feels like the action he does is the right action. To not know what is right or what is wrong, is alien to Luke. That's why him understanding that failure isn't the end is important. Because Luke that we see isn't a person who lost a limb in some grand battle, it's a person who lost his own confidence and certainty due to his own selfish, irresponsible, and impulsive actions. 

I think the reason that the whiplash of the Luke we see is so sudden to both Mark Hamill and to the rest of us Star Wars fans. Is because Luke Skywalker has never been criticized for his actions. We hype up his legacy. We hype up what he did was correct. Because it all worked out in the end. But in reality, Luke's actions were not the correct ones. They were the actions that may have worked out in the end, but they weren't the actions that a Jedi should take. The Last Jedi is not so much a deconstruction or parody of Luke from ROTJ, but an examination of the natural long-term consequences of having the type of mentality that Luke has.

Now did George Lucas INTEND for Luke's character to be like this? Yes and no. I do know that Luke was always supposed to have that impulsive and somewhat irresponsible nature, but I don't think he wanted him to essentially be the equivalent of the smart kid that never studied in high school and flunked in college when he realized that he couldn't coast through life all the time. But I do think that was always an elements of Luke Skywalker's character that has never been that closely examined before.

"Thinking Out Loud: What if all the TLJ and Solo ""plot holes"" and ""irrelevant"" scenes are ultimately part of the grand finale...","Obviously no one knows and why speculate and blah blah blah... but it would be very interesting to see how the fan base reacts to a situation where the things that people generally view as being irrelevant or stupid about TLJ are constituent pieces of EPIX's fermata.

Like, for example, if the entire purpose of the excursion to Canto was just a vehicle for little slave boy to get the resistance ring (for some future plot twist) or if Luke's demise was necessary for a new plot piece that needed him to be a Force Ghost (maybe he'll have his journey with the Whills) or if Phasma survives and becomes something or if Snoke's demise was a puppeteering ploy all along for a more insidious villain, etc.

One of the biggest issues with the Sequel Trilogy that maybe isn’t discussed enough: there’s a lack of good villains. One of the greatest things about Star Wars OT and PT were the cool bad guys. All we really have is Kylo and he’s borderline a protagonist at this point.,"I know this has been talked about, but it’s really underrated in how it’s hurting the ST. One of the things that stood out for a lot of people in the original Star Wars was all the different types of villains and how they each were cool.

Vader-goes without saying

The emperor-Extremely intimidating, pure evil

Tarkin-tactical mastermind, more of a “classical” kind of villain

Boba Fett-I never understood the hype personally, but I can see how folks thought he was a badass bad guy as well because of his presence in his small screen time and his cool gear

Jabba-A behind the scenes villain, but still someone we heard about and someone who made the world feel bigger

Then there was the Prequel Trilogy, and for all its faults, it did introduce some really awesome villains while adding more depth to the emperor.

Maul-Dual light saber, cool look. Even without his clone wars/rebels revival he was still a bad ass character for the one film he was in

Count Dooku- Under Utilized, but it was still a cool new villain and a complex character, also a cool light saber design 

General Grievous- While he was a bit less intimidating than he could have been, he was at least cool in his voice and his design. And he was UNIQUE! 

Palpatine/Sidious- not a new character, but he was fleshed our nicely and they did an awesome job showing what a manipulative mastermind he is

Sequel Villains

Kylo- the best villain in terms of how fleshed it he is, but he’s not intimidating because we’ve already seen him lose multiple times and it’s shown after TLJ that Rey is basically his equal. He’s more of a dual protagonist than an evil villain 

Snoke- Had potential if he had a cooler back story and some on-screen motivation, but his death makes him just a lack luster plot device 

Hux- had some potential, but is just a joke at this point. I basically equate him to this trilogy’s general grievous, except grievous had redeeming features in his appearance/demeanor/voice/light sabers. Hux lacks that. 

Phasma-A very interesting villain with potential, and could have been the first female baddy in a Star Wars trilogy, but they couldn’t figure out how to use her and just threw her in to be easily defeated at the end of both movies. Phasma would have been much better suited as Finn’s primary antagonist in both films instead of just thrown in randomly at the end.

BUT most of all, both the Original Trilogy and the Sequel Trilogy gave us at least one big, bad, intimidating villain that we could go into the final movie wondering how they could be stopped(in both cases it was the emperor, but you could also argue it was Vader in the Original). The sequels are missing that big threat. ",StarWars,True,1530585971,2018-07-02
Why I didnt like Solo: A Star Wars Story.,"So someone in a Facebook group asked why I thought Solo was bad and I ended up writing a full review. I thought I'd share it with you fine folks. 

Straight out of the gate I was not a fan of Alden  Ehrenreich's performance. Im not sure what exactly he was going for but it did not feel like Han Solo. In fact at times it felt like he was doing a bad impression of Leonardo Dicaprio in Titanic.

The writers decisions on which parts of the characters backstory to expand on were silly and quite underwhelming for example: the origin of his surname, Chewies nickname or where he got his iconic blaster. These are not questions worth answering in my opinion. 

I waned to see some form of development and character arc for Han Solo but it was non-existent in this film. We dont learn what causes him to act the way he does, how he acquired his skill set or why he is so skilled at flying/shooting/being a suave bastard. He is just good at everything from the get go and I found this boring. 

The constant fan service was overwhelming at times and although I understood all the references to the star wars universe and the other films I dont see why this time wasn't used for actual dialogue to do with the plot/story. I find it jarring that the writers feel the need to constantly remind us that we're watching a star wars movie by throwing in references instead of just focussing on the story they are trying to tell. A little fan service goes a long way but when overused or executed poorly it can raise eyebrows in an audience and take you out of the experience. 

I thought Childish Gambino was a great casting choice for Lando and was very excited to see him in the movie but i felt his performance was completely sidelined and overall useless to the plot of the film. He needed to be in the movie because the Millennium Falcon needed to be in the movie. His character doesn't go much further than that.

All in all i would say that it's difficult to invest yourself in a story that you already know the outcome to. I never feared for Solo's safety once because he appears in later films so any tension is lost by the knowlege that no harm will come to him. 

If I had my way i think Star Wars needs to completely distance itself from the original saga. No more of this filling in the gaps between the existing movies business. Give us completely new settings, completely new characters and completely new storties. In my humble opinion that is the way forward for our beloved franchise. 

Ive never written something like this before so please let me know if I missed or am incorrect about anything. Also please share with me your thoughts on this latest addition to the amazing universe that is Star Wars. I will happily discuss my points further. 

If you made it this far then thankyou for reading and have a great day!

"Just my thoughts, about the franchise","Now before I start this is just my opinion and view on the films. Now I’m a massive fan of the whole Franchise (prequels included) and yes I do see all the faults in all the films but I just feel like at this point after all the reviews of Solo and TLJ it seems like audiences will never be happy no matter what films we get. Obviously there are problems with the prequels I’m not denying that but they are still fun films that I enjoy playing. Now looking at the newer films, TFA was a brilliant start to a new generation of Star Wars, yes it follows the plot of a new hope very closely but the characters are different and people are hating the film for being familiar just to tell the audiences that JJ and Disney want it to feel familiar but also different at the same time. And heaps of people fucking hate the movie because it’s too familiar. It’s not a perfect film but it’s a fun time and a good start to a new trilogy. 

Now TLJ I’m probably going to get hate for this but personally I loved the film, yes I can see its problems and why people might not like it, but for people to say it’s the worse film in the franchise is completely wrong.  The film is different to everything we’ve gotten in the saga so far. Splitting the fan base and doing things differently I’m glad that Rian Johnson took that way because I was kinda getting bored of the same formula. If the film was similar to empire it would be the exact same as TFA being slated as unoriginal and boring. Taking this leap is the direction the franchise needed. It’s essentially Disney saying this is our franchise now and we are taking it in a different direction and I give them props for that. Solo had problems too but it was a fun space heist movie which I actually liked and the ending allows for more films in that timeline to come about and that gets me excited. These are my opinions so feel free to hate on me, just thought I’d put it out there ",StarWars,True,1530589215,2018-07-02

The Last Jedi thought experiment,"There’s a thought experiment I’ve had for a while: if you took the prequels and made them their own franchise, with all connections to the Star Wars universe removed, would people have been kinder to those movies? I came up with this because one of the big complaints is how the prequels handled the lore of the original trilogy (e.g. midichlorians).

Similarly, one of the big complaints of The Last Jedi from people who didn’t like it is how it handled the lore of the original trilogy, specifically how it portrayed Luke. I’m not here to argue whether it was a good creative decision to take the optimist Luke from the original trilogy and give him the Logan treatment because it’s completely subjective. But that does bring me to my point from earlier:

Suppose all connections to the Star Wars universe were completely removed from The Last Jedi, but all the main plot points were basically the same. Do you think the movie would then have been better received?",StarWars,True,1530592210,2018-07-03
Did anyone think Canto Bight was a *highlight* of The Last Jedi?,"Of all the debate on all the criticisms of TLJ, that's one that seems to stick, for me.

Some people seem to like the idea, but even they don't seem to like the execution.

Spoiler: Did they completely mess up with Han Solo’s last name being a nickname?,"If Solo is not Han’s real last name, why is Ben Solo a “Solo” and not a “Skywalker”.

Also, what do you think of this choice? ",StarWars,True,1530594574,2018-07-03
Am I the only one that's not worried about the future of Star Wars at all?,"Sure we got ourselves into a bit of a tuffle with TLJ and Solo but I want to remind everyone what we've got to look forward to?

Rian Johnson is getting his own completely original trilogy. Say what you will about TLJ but his past movies have been great. He's fanboied over Cowboy Bebop (just take a look at his twitter bio) and pointed to Akira as a big source of inspiration so if this new trilogy is anything like those two things then... hngh. Not to mention that moving forward, he'll probably take a lot of the backlash for TLJ into consideration.

Then there's D&amp;D's series of movies. These could be *anything.* Personally, I'd be surprised if they aren't Old Republic themed. I've been replaying KOTOR and it just feels like the perfect world for them to work in. 

And then we've got not one... but two shows in the works. The first one is *Resistance* helmed by the one and only Filoni. I think we can all agree that, while CW and Rebels both have their fair share of ups and downs, the man has more than proved himself. Plus it's looking to have a beautifully ""anime-inspired"" style to it. And then you've got Jon Favreau's new show (that everyone's gonna pirate). Almost everything this man has touched has been great and he's said this show is something he's been thinking about for a while. Both shows have the added benefit of being set after RotJ which is an era *rife* with potential.

As for other media, even though EA is total fucking shit, Respawn's *Fallen Order* is something to get excited for. There's been a rumor that Disney's contract with EA is gonna be done away with fairly soon (which is fantastic news if true). *Thrawn: Alliances* is surely going to continue Zahn's amazing track record.

So could it be better? ...Sure. Could we have an Obi-Wan movie confirmed? ...Sure. But right now, I think people just have a bit of a bad taste in their mouths. Trust me, as soon as some of this stuff starts coming out, I think we're in for a new golden age.",StarWars,True,1530597316,2018-07-03

The Biggest Challenge Star Wars Episode IX Will Face Is Not Fan Reactions,"From

https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2444180/the-biggest-challenge-star-wars-episode-ix-will-face-is-not-fan-reactions


&gt;With Solo: A Star Wars Story now in our rear-view mirror, we begin the long year and a half wait to return to a galaxy far, far away in Star Wars: Episode IX. That trilogy-capper from director J.J. Abrams is in the unenviable position of being the sequel to the incredibly divisive Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The reactions to Rian Johnson's film have ranged from valid criticisms to calls for a remake to indefensible hatred. 

&gt;Despite all this, arguably the biggest challenge Episode IX will face is not fan reactions, but competition at the box office, as no shortage of other big movies are slated to release in the fertile holiday ground looking to siphon away dollars from Star Wars' coffers.

&gt;Since blockbuster season now runs January to December, studios have no problem placing tentpole events at the end of the year and even within the sphere of the mighty Star Wars franchise. 

&gt;Sequels, reboots, big IPs and franchise titles are all opening in November and December of 2019. The DCEU's guiding star Diana Prince returns in Wonder Woman 1984 in November, as does Daniel Craig's 007 in James Bond 25. The Terminator franchise reboots again in November 2019 alongside the debut of iconic video game speedster Sonic the Hedgehog. 

&gt;And, of course, Frozen 2 arrives to dominate the box office. Some of these titles might peter out by the time December rolls around, but some, like Frozen 2, may have serious staying power.

&gt;Things don't get too much easier once December hits, as Murder on the Orient Express sequel Death on the Nile, as well as Universal's Wicked both provide interesting counter-programming to the sci-fi bombast of Star Wars. Also opening in December, a week beforeEpisode IX, is Jumanji 3. 

&gt;Some of these titles could shift and get delayed, and others could be added, but this is a lot of big name movies. As Forbes explained, the sheer amount of movies opening in this two-month span is a bigger threat to the global performance of Episode IX than any boycotts or fatigue. 

&gt;Some of these titles will inevitably take away dollars from Episode IX that it would have likely enjoyed had it been running unopposed. Even within the Disney stable, guaranteed juggernaut Frozen 2 is opening less than a month before, Episode IX. This isn't exactly the same as Avengers: Infinity War opening less than a month before Solo, but it is something to consider.

&gt;When Star Wars returned in 2015, the adult comedy Sisters performed well as counter-programming, but that movie didn't have the benefit of wide-appeal and a family friendly rating. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle proved last year just how well another family friendly action movie can do even in the orbit of a Star Wars movie. 

&gt;Star Wars isn't the only game in town, and while another big sci-fi blockbuster won't be foolish enough to open the same weekend, it has been proven that money can be made with family-friendly movies and counter-programming released near Star Wars. This may end up leading to fewer repeat viewings and a lower box office for Episode IX, regardless of the reaction to the film itself.

How do force powers from a distance work? (TLJ spoilers)?,"So when rewatching TLJ, I thought about how Snoke humiliates Hux by dragging him around on the floor using the force. Snoke is not too far, but he is not too close either. This is reminiscent of Vader force choking the guy on the screen. This makes sense with what we know about the Force. It binds all living things together, near or far, so force abilities can work over vast distances. My question is, can’t Snoke just use force choke or something similar to eliminate the leaders of the Resistance? Why does he wait for this chase to prolong the encounter? Does the force user need to see the target for the powers to work? 

As an addendum, could the force be used to effectively assassinate someone without being close to them? Using the force to crush someone’s heart or something like that? Has this been explored in the EU (new or old)?

General Discussion About The Fate of The Francise,"In general, I would call the Star Wars buyout by Disney a monumental financial success. They have had three films crack a billion dollars worldwide with the re-release of the prequels in 3D bringing those films up substantially, especially in conversation. In addition, they have launched countless productions such as the Blu-ray editions of the original six films as well as Rebels (though most of that team was holdover from Clone Wars). They have merchandising, licensing (a la LEGO), and even viral marketing campaigns (like the mobile games and apps) increasing brand awareness and keeping Star Wars in the public consciousness. This generates negligible revenue (in the grand scheme of things), but produces a massive benefit by targeting key audiences and balancing the budget in quarters where new releases aren't occurring. This train sees no real sign of stopping.

My question is this: is anyone else feeling the fatigue? 

I was truly blessed to be born when I did. I never saw the Prequels in theatres (I was reasonably young and my mum thought they were a little too adult...yes, I know...), but I grew up with the good Battlefronts, the LEGO games, the cartoons; it was all ""uncool,"" but it filled the need and met audiences where they wanted it. I would say it was joyful fan content at its best. While financial goals had to be met, it was understood that quality fan-service, done with respect, would be absolutely enough to meet them. We never saw the guy who had a ""death sentence in 12 systems,"" but we instead had a tie-in comic to Attack of the Clones that ended up being better than the film (the Assaj Ventress comic....what was that called? Vengeance?) I would call this era that gave us Knights of the Old Republic, a slough of great Dark Horse comics, and two excellent Clone Wars cartoons a massive financial success, despite relying on a less visible marketing tactic and a cult fanbase.

Four new movies in and I feel more fatigued than ever. I lose track of count every time I try to figure how many Star Wars video games were released from 1995-2015, but 2015-2018 is super easy. Two. If you count the LEGO game, then three. If you count the mobile games, then five. My point is that it seems like EA doesn't care about the license enough to put effort into keeping it alive on their end. I like The Old Republic, but EA stands amid BioWare's achievement, not theirs. Marvel is trying desperately to pick up the slack of Star Wars comics, and I can't complain, but it's not the same. It's very, very corporate. You have to have your Battlefront movie tie-ins (Rouge One for BF1, Solo and Last Jedi for BF2). Your mobile games are huge adverts for the movies (PREORDER tickets today!!!). Everything must support the movies. Everything counts on the billion-dollar December. 

I actually really liked Solo. I think Ron Howard did a good job, all things considered. But it really made me think. Rogue One and Solo are interesting films, but did they really NEED to be big productions? If I saw those films as three-part episodes on Clone Wars I would be ecstatic. I still watch the Mandelorian Plot every so often (thank you Paul Dini!!!). These projects realistically could have been budgeted smaller and seen a much larger success and lasting impact if they were treated respectfully. Star Wars is changing, and we will get more Last Jedi's, we will get more Solos. We will get more merchandising and viral marketing, this is all inevitable. 

I'm honestly afraid I'll get really bored, really quick. There is so little creativity, there is so little breadth of creative instinct that it all seems kinda samey. And if all they want is a billion-dollar film once a year, I definitely will get bored. I'm a huge Marvel fan and I'm slightly unenthused about Ant Man and the Wasp this Friday (unless it's good...), but that is a conversation for another time. 

All Disney's tactics are predictable. Their path forward is inevitable. I wonder if this means a degradation of the fanbase is inevitable. I appreciate your input.

I know it’s probably not anyone in this sub writing articles that blast people for disliking TLJ and grouping us all together with the absolute degenerates that do use derogatory comments and actions towards the people in the film and that made the film.

I wish I did like TLJ, because any Star Wars film I don’t like just seems wrong to me. But I don’t, and if you do, then it’s okay. Let’s just all get a long.",StarWars,True,1530624371,2018-07-03
Star wars romance stories that you recommend?,"To me bastila and revan from KOTOR is my favorite romance out of all of star wars. Makes me wanna cry that revan and bastila never get to see each other again. But their is still a lot happiness in their story. A close second would be Juno eclipse and Galen Marek. Too bad their is no force unleashed 3.

Obviously Padme and Anakin ends in tragedy. Han and Leia love will always be special because I know. Unfortunately their demon child ruins things. I don't really know that much about Mara Jade and Luke, other than she died

So anyway what star wars stories do you recommend for me that have a romance? Movies books comics video games whatever

EU Legends/Canon stories all are welcome

But a true romance please, not a fling or casual Hook up

Thank you

Failing To Meet Expectations | The Skywalker Curse,"Just wanted to document an interesting parallel between the three generations of Skywalker men that we've been following.  As you can tell from the title, it's about their inability to meet the expectations that are placed upon them.

Anakin Skywalker was plucked from a live of slavery and brought into the Jedi Order as the supposed ""Chosen One"" of prophecy.  He was told that he'd become the greatest of all Jedi, that he'd destroy their mortal enemy: the Sith, and that he'd restore balance to the Force.  And what happened?  He did indeed become a powerful Jedi, but he also became disillusioned with the Order because of their rigid code that forbid him from having attachments; something he could not do.  He ultimately turns on the Jedi and spearheads their destruction.

Luke Skywalker was chosen by the two surviving Jedi to be their hope for the future.  At a relatively older age, he began his study of the Force, and he quickly proved to be powerful, much like his father.  Luke was ultimately able to succeed where his mentors failed.  He redeemed his father and brought down Palpatine's Empire, thereby ending the Sith once and for all.  But like his father, he was burdened with impossible expectations.  This boy who became a Jedi after only a few years was tasked with restoring the Jedi Order.  Which leads us to...

Ben Solo was seen by Luke as the next great Skywalker hero.  He'd be the future of the Jedi Order.  But, as we all know, that wasn't meant to be.  Ben was seduced by the dark side of the Force.  He became obsessed with his grandfather's legacy and made it his mission to succeed where Darth Vader had failed.  He would end the Jedi once and for all, all while seizing ultimate power for himself.  Instead of being the galaxy's next great hero, he'd become the galaxy's next ruthless tyrant.

What's interesting about Anakin and Luke is that they're both given a sense of redemption.  Yes, Anakin spent most of his adult life serving the Empire, but in the end, he allowed the light within him to win out.  Because of Luke's belief in him, he returned to the light side and destroyed his Sith Master.  And although gave up on trying to restore the Jedi Order after Ben's fall, he eventually embraced his legendary status and used it to inspire a new generation of potential Jedi Knights.

It remains to be seen which direction they'll take Ben Solo in IX, but there's always a chance he'll have some sort of ""redemption,"" just like the last two generations did.",StarWars,True,1530630387,2018-07-03
Would you like to see non-Canon cartoon adaptation of old EU (Legends) material?,"I like a lot of old EU materials such as KOTOR, Dark Horse comics, and the New Jedi Order book. However, the story will not fit with the current Canon timeline. I think Disney should use the Legends brand to release non-Canon cartoon adaptation of the old EU materials. I really like those trailers for The Old Republic and wish if we could have full length animated movie like that.

For example, DC Comics has the DC Universe Animated Original Movies that are direct-to-video adaptation of old comics arc or even the new ones from the New 52. Some of them are new stories which are partially based on some of the comics elements. This year, Marvel also has the upcoming Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse animated movie that is set in an alternative universe.

I think this is best way to have more Star Wars for us without messing up the Canon timeline. The adaptation could be updated/changed to improve the quality too. ",StarWars,True,1530633445,2018-07-03
"I think they should ""Godfather Part 2"" IX","I posted this on r/Starwarsspeculation

I think they should ""Godfather Pt 2"" IX. A third of the movie should be the story of the academy and how Kylo really snapped and betrayed everyone with the Knights of Ren. Pay Ford a few million for a few minutes of shooting and have him have a small roll so Han and Luke can have a scene. Have a line or two explaining Snoke and show how he got to Kylo. Have the story line show Ben Solo turning into Kylo Ren as the main story shows Kylo Rem turn towards Ben Solo. Maybe at the end he gives into the light, maybe he doesn't.

Have the main story be about him and the Knights controlling the First Order. Give the movie a 5 year time jump. The FO have conquered parts of the galaxy but other parts have banded together to reform the New Republic so it can be massive in scale. Have a massive battle/space battle for once ffs. No more of this tag tag shit.

Idk maybe have some macguffin that involves ancient Jedi or some shit so Force ghost/ressurected Luke can have a cool role and be a badass. Maybe have it be something involving a thing or guy named ""Ren"" so you can have Ben and these students research that and become the Knights in the flashback B plot and that could tie into the Rey and company A plot. Idk. 

The climax should be the Knights fucking shit up and Kylo killing one to save Rey, like in her TFA vision and ties the whole thing together. Literally have it be out of the vision, maybe with slight variation. It should be at the end so he can be evil as hell throughout most the film.

The movie doesnt have to be 3 hours, either. Its Star Wars. Have the B plot only be like a third of the movie tops, and keep the A plot streamlined (find the macguffin, a few giant battles, final confrontation, etc where most of the leads kinda stick together save for the climax). The emotional and crazy shit we find out in the B plot would help develop the A plot, anyways.

This way they dont have to hide Like in the previews and I feel like it could tie up loose ends (Snoke, the flashback in TFA with the Knights, etc). Seeing him in the preview could drum up excitement from some people who are pissed. That way he could have a big role with the flashback plot, and could come back for a fan servicy lightsaber force ghost duel finale or something but they could still keep that a secret...and no Deathstar IV.

The Dark Side &amp; Necessity,"Just wondering if anybody else shared my opinion on the role of 'The Dark Side' within the wider Force. It seems like the bane of the Jedi was stagnation, which in turn led to weakness and corruption. Darksiders like Palpatine, Snoke, and Kylo are agents of chaos and change. I believe that The Dark Side, in its purest, untainted state, is to prevent stasis in the galaxy. The Light side is all about preserving and protecting, but the flip-side of that is stagnation, where nothing changes until whatever cycle is being maintained collapses irreparably. Individuals who try to use the Dark Side, with it being a powerful weapon, can never achieve immortality thought it because such a state is antithetical to the dark power. Only through the light can one retain their individuality, and that state of oneness requires them to selflessly separate themselves from the nirvana that is oneness with The Force. The Dark Side is The Forces way to provide challenges that life needs to overcome, to force evolution, and to bring about whatever the final will of The Force is.

"A New Novel just made one of my theories correct. Thanks to ""The Might Chewbacca and the Forest of Fear"" we now have Sith Ghosts in Canon again.","A while ago I posted this theory https://www.reddit.com/r/MawInstallation/comments/7iqnp6/why_sith_ghosts_dont_really_break_george_lucas_no/ about sith ghosts. You can read the whole thing but basically Lucas and many mix together the idea that all ghosts to mean force ghosts when force ghosts and spirits are two distinct things. And that Sith never created force ghosts because they bound their essance to a place or a item. I even used mother talzin and the nightsister ghosts, Rur, and the Presence from Rebels to back up my idea of it already being canon. 

But now we have our first (or second if the Presence is really a spirit and not a Holocron keeper like I think) peek at a sith surviving after death. (Sith Ghosts /= Force Ghosts and no sith ever became one with the force and stayed a spirit in legends) ",StarWars,True,1530635845,2018-07-03
Is this the right sub to talk about Jedis? It seems like they are either dumb/poorly written (Assuming Clone Wars the animated series is part of the universe),"So the Jedi (especially Windu and Yoda) don't really do much.  They easily could have taken out Grievous way earlier in the war.

Count Dooku can force choke people over holograms, and yet the entire council just stood and video chats with Grievous while he holds Koth hostage.  We know Jedi can use the force together almost synergistically because multiple Jedi to do it to interrogate (I think it was) Cad Bane.

Anakin (to stop someone from running away) just picked up the guy using the force, and yet no Jedi just stopped and thought, if I pick up Grievous and hold him, I caught him?


This is just in the first couple seasons, and about Grievous, it doesn't even account for the hundreds of other times a situation is solved by using the force in a creative manner or even obvious manner.

Is this just poor writing?  Or is this more like, the Jedi don't train to use the force in more than a couple ways (detecting blasts from droids, and push/pull).",StarWars,True,1530637007,2018-07-03

Do you think the Sequel Trilogy will be looked upon more fondly as it ages?,"Thinking back to the Prequel Trilogy it seemed like they we're universally hated by fans at the time (except for little kids) and now I'm seeing people list RoTS as their favorite Star Wars movie. People hated TPM but now most people consider it pretty solid movie, minus Jar jar of course. The only one that remains solidly disliked is AoTC.  

So that leads me to wonder whether people will think of TFA and TLJ more fondly in the coming years, even though they are very controversial at the moment. Perhaps it's just because the Prequels had a lot of non-movie expansion that made them better but they could easily do that with the sequels too. ",StarWars,True,1530641794,2018-07-03
Who will Ben Solo redeem himself to?,"I know, it's probably been discussed here multiple times, but I just want to throw my hat in the ring and say that this really has me curious.

In Episode VII, he kills off Han.  In Episode VIII, Luke dies.  Then, before shooting starts on Episode IX, Carrie Fisher dies.  So who is Kylo Ren supposed to be redeemed to?  Rian Johnson really screwed us in Episode VIII.  Rey's parents had no backstory.  Snoke had no backstory.  Luke dies from some form of astral projection... talk about stopping a story cold.  They had to bring back JJ Abrams just to try to salvage the trilogy.  

There are only two options in my opinion:

1.  Han survived the fall and got patched up by someone and he returns in Episode IX.  I highly doubt this because Harrison Ford said he wanted Han to stay dead.

2.  Luke really didn't die at the end of Episode VIII, he just opened up some new Force power that we haven't seen yet, and he will be alive and well for the next movie.

He can't just redeem himself to Rey.  That's lame and shouldn't even be considered.  And if it's not her, then there's no one else that's left alive to welcome his to turn back to the light.

So what do you guys think?  Are you cool with Episode VIII or are you like me and kind of think Rian Johnson dropped a big wet turd on the franchise?",StarWars,True,1530641966,2018-07-03
I rewatched The Last Jedi for the first time last night. Thanks Netflix!,"Has anyone else had a chance to see it again?

I remember liking it the first time but had some problems with it; The Finn/Rose storyline, keeping Poe out of the loop exclusively for dramatic tension, a few too many cutesy animals and scenes with those animals, the green milk tit monster, the inconsistent power and intelligence level of Snoke, and a couple other smaller things. These things still exist for me but their impact on my enjoyment of the film has lessened over time. 

The opening sequence is even more visually striking than I remember and Carrie Fisher really shines with more scenes compared to Force Awakens. 

The storyline with Luke, Rey, and Kylo is by far my favorite with some of the most compelling scenes and most interesting character dynamics. I wasn’t thrilled about Luke’s arc when I first saw it, but the story-telling is undeniably masterful. Upon rewatching, I noticed some great foreshadowing and character’s stories paralleling each other in different ways. Also, Yoda.

Yes the throne-room scene is epic..

Rewatched TLJ. Rose/Finn story still painful and generic to me but I enjoyed watching the movie more a second time.

How would you rank the episodic films based solely on their final scenes?,"I’m shamelessly mirroring [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8v5niq/how_would_you_rank_episodes_18_based_just_on/?st=JJ60CFAA&amp;sh=69091725) from a couple days ago, but hey, it was a fun idea, and I’d like to hear how people rank the endings.

1. Empire Strikes Back: This ending is so emotional. It really sells the desperation and confusion the main characters are feeling, with a tiny glimmer of hope. It’s near perfect in my eyes. 

2. The Force Awakens: This cliffhanger was mind blowing. Regardless of how you felt about the eventual payoff, I think the way this ending was handled was extremely strong. 

3. Return of the Jedi: Another great, emotional ending. The ghosts and celebration really end the movie on a high note. 

4: A New Hope: It’s iconic. The music is fantastic. Chewie should have gotten a medal. 

5: Attack of the Clones: This is a well-shot homage to Empire, but the lack of investment in the wedding itself keeps this one lower. 

6: The Last Jedi: Iactually really like the literal last shot of broom kid, but the scene as a whole only partially evokes the feel it was going for, and the timeline confusion really keeps it lower. 

7: Revenge of the Sith: It’s a nice homage to Binary Sunset, I guess. I dunno, I guess I would have preferred them to end on Vader. 

8: The Phantom Menace: the only truly mediocre Star Wars ending. I don’t care enough about the Gungans to get into their celebration. I *really* didn’t care about Anakin at this point. It’s weird to have all the Jedi there. I dunno, this one just didn’t do it for me. ",StarWars,True,1530642438,2018-07-03

Rey vs Kylo,"Although I’m a huge fan of TLJ, I found one fan suggestion that I absolutely love and can’t help but post about. 

The fan account, Reyawakened, posted about how Rey should’ve been serverly injured by Kylo after they took down the Praetorian Guards. This would’ve given the audience a classic lightsaber fight, and show how powerful Kylo really is when compared to Rey. 

In my mind, Rey would be injured similar to Kenobi in AotC. Her arm and leg would be cut, and her lightsaber would be cut in half as well.

Now what really gets me excited about this change is the imagery of Rey limping to the pile of rocks, and using all of her strength to move them out of the way and save the Resistance.

ReyAwakened also stated that injuring Rey would allow Finn to look over an injured Rey instead of Rose, similar to how Rey looked over an injured Finn at the end of TFA. 

So what are your thoughts on this? I highly recommend checking out ReyAwakened on Instagram. Credit to them for the idea that I can’t get out of my head!

[SPOILERS]So I just saw TLJ last night and was not impressed,"I was kind of surprised on how below average it was.  TFA was a pretty good movie so I was exoecting more from TLJ.  The characters seemed to be out of character and the decisions made by some of them were pretty ridiculous.  

-Let me start with Holdo who is one of the worst characters I have seen.  Terrible leaderhsip and poor communication.  She also lacked professionalism which is another trait high ranking officers normally have- her outfit and goofy hair also didn't help her character.

-The plan to suicide the ship into the enemy was also lazy writing.  You don't need a human to do that.  They could have just set the ship to auto or even used a droid;  those are futuristic ships.  And if you're going to suicide a ship, why not suicide all the other ships instead of waiting until you only have one left.

-The First Order is just your cliche bad guys and they were pretty dumb too.  Could'nt some of their ships just do a mini hyper jump ahead?

-Character development was pretty bad too.  Finn was a great character in TFA. In this one he is made into a bumbling idiot overshadowed by Rose.  Poe goes from a pretty likeable character in TFA to a moron in TLJ.  Rey had zero character development in TLJ.   
   
-How did Finn and Rose survive when their ships crashed into eachother?  If the initial impact didn't kill them, the drop to the ground, should have.  Also funny how there was no explosion.  And then afterwards, how the heck do they get back to the rebel based just in time for the Luke fight?  It took them a long time to fly out there but he dragged her back faster than a speeder.  I also dont understand how they made it without getting shot.

-And finally, Luke's end really sucked.  I think that was a huge complaint from most fans.

Hux is the True Villain? [OC],"This is purely my ideas that I had after watching The Last Jedi when it had been in theaters. Never thought to post until now.
- SteelCyclops

With Smoke being a character who had potential but was ultimately wasted, I believe their to be another villain, one who is above Kylo Ren. It didn't seem like Kylo is truly at the top. So hear me out now: General Hux is the true villain. I got this idea during the scene where Hux stands over Kylo before he wakes up after getting knocked out in the throne room scene. It looked to me like Hux was reaching to grab something but before he could, Kylo jerks awake. I had the impression that he was reaching for a weapon, possibly a lightsaber? He also seemed to have a disappointed look on his face. Later, Kylo and Hux argue over there being no supreme leader any more. Kylo then orders for every gun to fire on Luke, an order which is repeated by Hux before being carried out. Yes, it is possible that the First Order doesn't recognize Kylo as an authority figure. Hux seems to me like a very intelligent character while not showing his true colors. He made mistakes as a general, mistakes that, under Lord Vader, would have likely resulted in severe punishment, yet we see Snoke never punish him. This could mean that Snoke knew who was really at the top, Hux, while leading Kylo and everyone else to believe otherwise. The throne room scene could have been a test to see who Kylo would choose to side with. Given Kylo's decision, Hux would have been, as stated above, disappointed in him. This also has some support from the surprised look on Snoke's face when he was given the Darth Maul treatment. He knew that there was another who was above him. This draws similarities from when Palpatine orders Anakin to kill Dooku. Dooku looked very surprised that his master would order someone to kill him. Another similarity is present here. Palpatine was smart, he hid in plain sight, gained power/influence, and nobody suspected anything. Hux may be doing the same; hide in plain sight, gain power/influence, and be unsuspecting. 

There is plenty more that could be added but I think I have made my point clear.

I personally think there is some credibility to what I think and a few friends who I've run this by agree that it would be a surprise but not at all impossible. Again, these are just my thoughts and I realize there may be holes but the more I think about it, the more I fill in. 
Thanks for taking the time to read this. Hopefully this gives you something to think about.

Introducing my best friend to Star Wars,"I introduced her the franchise on May 4th and we havent loked back since, now she  was VERY skeptical, the only positive things she felt about it were R2, Liam Neeson and Ewan, she was very ""meh"" to it in general. Since she already knew the Vader twist, we agreed to chronological order and after the first two prequels she liked, she wanted to see the Clone Wars story with how attached she got to Anakin, Kenobi, Padme, and interested in the Clones without another time-skip. We watched the original 2D Clone Wars surrounding the canon 3D/CGI The Clone Wars and though she preferred to take our time the first few seasons in, by the Mortis arc after going chronological for the episodes, she was more hooked than me!

Best part is the Vader twist was kinda an echo in the back of her mind by the time we finished all animated Clone Wars that I actually asked her, you want Episode III next or you wanna save it for later due to some ""spoilers"" it gives the later originals? She said she didn't grow up with the franchise or have any nostalgia about what other movies do that she hasn't even seen yet, there and then she was invested in the prequel characters and wanted Revenge of the Sith. We're staying chronological!

So we went into Episode III and after all the emotional build-up and investment, she already got teary-eyed a few prior times, we watched Revenge of the Sith and when those 10-15 minutes came from Palpatine's Sith reveal to Skywalker up to his darkside Fall after disarming Windu... she was in shock. In many ways despite having known the Vader twist, it was like seeing Anakin die in a way worse than literal death for her, betraying the Republic, himself, and her. Yet after The Clone Wars, it wasn't a lightswitch, it was actually sickingly undetstandable and it made her more emotional than ever... we were in tears by the movie's end.

Right around this time Solo was premiering in theatres so we went to see that, it kinda elevated her out of the gloom of Episode III. She fondly remembered Chewie from his supporting veteran role with Yoda (remembering him there from his guest time in The Clone Wars as well), loved the introductions to Han and Lando, surprised by the ending cameo and curious where things are going with him. Things were still feeling fresh after Episode III's end at this point and that's one thing she was hoping for, as she was weary about the 2-decade time-skip into the original.

We watched Rebels after Solo, the first three seasons on my DVDs and having to watch Season 4 on her firestick, she really enjoyed that. Loved the story of the Ghost crew, continuing certain loose-ends from The Clone Wars, appearances from characters like R2 and 3PO, Lando, Bail Organa, Yoda, Vader, Maul! I also pointed out how little things like Saw and the Krennic/Stardust mentions were leading to the next movie, how the World Between Worlds was a big converging moment, and the show's epilogue only spoilering the Ghost crew's future. Amazing show!

We watched Rogue One and A New Hope back-to-back just yesterday, she loved the experience and even said in surprise ""I can't believe Rogue One came out a year and a half ago, but A New Hope was in the 70s!"", she's loving this. We are watching the Special Editions from my Blu-Rays, I did ask her right after Rogue One if she wanted to watch this updated version or the originals on 2006 DVDs I got stashed away, she said whatever meshes best with what she's already seen and she prefers HD anyway. She felt more from the final Vader/Leia scenes in Rogue One than Jyn/Cassian's resolution, but was totally captivated by Luke and Han's stories while glued to the screen for Kenobi's farewell battle with Vader.

Now more ready than ever to watch The Empire Strikes Back and beyond, wish us luck!",StarWars,True,1530662072,2018-07-03

How did Kylo and Snoke know Luke survived?,"Maybe it's been answered in one of the books that I'm not aware of.

In TLJ It's established that Kylo left the academy in ruins and assumed Luke to be dead, at least Luke believes Kylo assumed he was dead. Luke then cut himself off from the force, left everybody without telling them where he was going, and went to the Ahch-To to die. 

The whole time Snoke and Kylo figured Luke would train new Jedi and spent both movies trying to track him down, so they knew the whole time he was alive. At what point did they realize this?",StarWars,True,1530664923,2018-07-03
All possible Kylo/Rey endings: choose your favorite!,"1. Rey survives, Kylo dies
2. Kylo survives, Rey dies
3. Both survive
4. Both die
5. Kylo kills Rey
6. Rey kills Kylo
7. They fall in love
8. Both remain on their respective Light and Dark sides of the Force
9. They switch sides of the Force
10. They both end up on the Light
11. They both end up on the Dark
12. Kylo sacrifices himself to save Ren, or for another cause
13. Ren sacrifices herself for Kylo, or for another cause

I think this pretty much covers most possible permutations of the outcomes, choose your favorite and explain! So for instance, I think one of the below scenarios is most likely:

**2, 7, 10, 13:** Rey and Kylo fall in love, Rey sacrifices herself to save Kylo, who survives, and then turns to the Light.

OR

**3, 9**: Something causes both of them to switch sides of the force and the final victor does not or cannot vanquish the defeated, leaving their fates open-ended for possible future movies.

OR

**5, 7, 9:** Rey and Kylo fall in love, something causes them to switch sides of the Force, Kylo is forced to kill Rey.",StarWars,True,1530665849,2018-07-03

Kylo’s Fate in Episode IX,"I’ve been daydreaming about Epsiode IX a lot lately, and how it might wrap up the Skywalker saga (for now at least). 

Personally, I don’t think they’re going to end the saga with the death of Kylo Ren, nor do I think he’s going to be redeemed. 

My theory is that Kylo’s arc in Episode IX will mirror Anakin’s in Episode III. Kylo will become so consumed by the dark side, that he is eventually defeated due to his own hubris. He will be severely injured, but alive. 

Rey refuses to kill Kylo because she believes that he can still be saved. The ST will end on a positive note, similar to the OT, but have it’s own unique flavor.

Star Wars: The Rebel Files released to day and introduced a lot of old Superweapons (or at least the rumors of them) into the new canon.,"Star Wars: The Rebel Files released today in the US though it had been released earlier elsewhere. The book is a lot like ""The Jedi Path/Book of the Sith"" Where it is created to look like a in universe document. This one is about top secret rebel information. 

The book recanonizes a some legends things or for others recanonized the names (Ship A is called Ship A in both canon's now. Its less confusing that way). Its a really good book and worth the pickup for a fun in universe read. But what is most intersting to me are the superweapons. The book brings back at least five imperial superweapons (Five are named but the code phrases like black saber or prisim could be revealed later to be what ever a writer needs for that story) ranging from the old marvel comics to the books to the games along with adding a new one to the mix. 

The first is a well known device that we have known about for a while or at least speculated about. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Shadow_Generator  ""The Mass Shadow Generator was a superweapon that could allegedly exist simultaneously in realspace and hyperspace. Although a Rebel Alliance report conceded that the generator may be nothing more than a tall tale, it was depicted within the same report as being axially symmetrical in design, consisting of four truncated square pyramids. "" This one is more of a ""it may be out there system or it may not have been completed but they were defiantly working on it"" type of thing. 

The Second one is something that while from Legends never really appeared anywhere outside of RPG and Lore guide books. It takes the hard sci-fi idea of just strapping a gun on a box up a notch. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Torpedo_Sphere  ""These two-kilometer siege platforms are armed with hundreds of proton torpedo launchers that can crack any planetary shield, given time and patience."" Basically just a large portable egg shaped space station with tons of missiles. This is one of the existing ones not just a test bed prototype. 

Dating ALL the way back from the old '77 Marvel comics is the Omega Frost superweapon http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Omega_Frost. It was an Interstellar Freeze way that could freeze anything caught between its two poles. This one is probably just in as a reference to the old '77 comics as while it has a picture in the book its also referred to as probably being intentional disinformation

The Next one is a ship that gets a lot of hate. NO, not the OP shuttle with a reasonable main weapon (seriously if you think blowing up suns is a little much go read some David Weber or other sci-fi series.) I mean the Eye of Palpatine http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Asteroid_Dreadnought, a mobile dreadnought carved out of a asteroid with guns placed on the outer parts of the asteroid. This one is another of the ""It could exist or it could just be nothing"" rumors.

And finally is a new one that we haven't seen before. Well that's not totally true. The SW Trading Card Game had a ship slightly similar to this one but it was a different class and had a different weapon. http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Siege_Breaker The Siege Breaker was a large capital ship with a main weapon that could shatter weapons. And apparently it may be what the main weapons of the dreadnaught that fired at the rebel base in TLJ were based on. 

So I just thought it was intersting at the number of superweapons (either real or rumored) that this book brought into canon. So fare the NEU has more Trooper varients than Legends did and is catching up in TIE varients. And now they are adding in superweapons. 

To me I think it makes sense the Empire had a whole super weapons division that tried so many varied designs.  If you take a moment to look at the German Wunderwaffe (wonder weapons) page on wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderwaffe you can see that the nation the Empire was based off of also liked their super weapons, all 73 of them.

"Best place to buy jackets, etc... from the films?","I've thought about trying to get a screen-accurate Star Wars jacket just to wear, not as part of a cosplay or anything, just for fun. However, every time I look, something about the ones I find always ends up putting me off. Basically, a lot of the jackets I've come across *look* really good, but they always have these awkward and vague reviews in borderline broken english, and a lot of the time there appear to be multiple different sellers offering exactly the same product. There are a ton of counterfeiters out there, so I've always been too wary to ever buy anything.

Has anyone actually gotten anything from one of these sellers? The big ones seem to be places like Fjackets and Decrum. Again, all their pictures of the product *look* really good, but they always seem a little off-kilter.

Hopefully this doesn't break the ""no buying/selling"" rule since I'm not actually looking to buy from someone directly from here. I'm just trying to figure out if any of these sellers out there won't end up ripping me off.",StarWars,True,1530672579,2018-07-03

Cool Easter Egg I noticed during Solo that connects to other media,"As we see at the beginning of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode “rookies”, a radio broadcast that domino squad is listening to states:

There was a detachment of the 224th known as the mud-jumpers that fought in Mumbai during the Clone Wars. Once the Galactic Empire was established, the 224th apparently was returned to Mimban to control energy mining production as seen in the new movie. 

I only noticed this as I’m rewatching the tv series at the moment. These references honestly make the show more enjoyable.

The Introduction of Star Wars: Where Should Newcomers Begin?,"I've been thinking about the proper way to introduce the Star Wars franchise to newcomers lately. There are numerous ways people prefer, no doubt, but my way is as follows:

-The Original Trilogy (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi)

-The Prequel Trilogy (The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith)

-Rogue One

-Solo

-The Sequel Trilogy (The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, Episode IX)

***The Clone Wars and Rebels

I feel as if the original trilogy should always come first. That's where Star Wars began and that's where the heart of the series is at its core. The prequels were next to be released so naturally they should come after the originals.

The rest of this got a bit tricky, but hear me out. Rogue One, to me, while being set directly before A New Hope does, in a way, continue the story of Revenge of the Sith well. It takes small moments and characters from Revenge of the Sith and builds off of them.

Solo should come directly before The Force Awakens. The story of how Han got his start coincides well with Han's arc in The Force Awakens. And certain elements of Solo might interest new fans in The Clone Wars and Rebels which should be explored after....

....the sequel trilogy! The sequels are the end of everything (for now) and because of this it makes since for our introduction to the Star Wars franchise to end here. And while Episode IX isn't out yet, it will be eventually.

And If these new fans (or you new fans) are interested then check out The Clone Wars ( the 2008 series) and Rebels afterwards! It'll expand greatly on characters and themes introduced in the films which may just enrich the series even more for any newcomers!

In the end, everyone has their own way of introducing Star Wars to someone and I won't disagree with anyone else's way of doing things. This is just the way I personally would introduce someone to the series!

So if you're new to this series or you know someone who you want to introduce to Star Wars, I hope everyone enjoys it and I hope this helped!",StarWars,True,1530679922,2018-07-04
"Why do people still deny Kylo and Rey are the romantic story of the ST? It’s mirrored Padme and Anakin. JJ, RJ, and Filoni have all hinted at it.","I think it’s pretty clear at this point. 

JJ talked about Kylo in the TFA commentary a lot referring to him as being like a prince, he and Rey’s meeting being like when the Disney princess runs into the forest and meets the prince etc. They’ve also mentioned beauty and the beast. 

RJ pushed them together a lot more in TLJ, and they have the strongest dynamic between any two characters in the ST at the moment. 

Beyond the obvious things in the movies, they’re a mirrored version of Anakin and Padme. Both in character design and story.

Padme and Anakin’s bond destroyed everything and caused all the bad things to happen, Kylo and Rey’s could bring balance and peace. 

Filoni also puts them directly together with Padme and Anakin in the Rebels between worlds episode where they mixed dialogue from the four of them.

I’ve thought it was super obvious since TLJ came out but it seems like a lot of people haven’t put it together?? 

Ben Solo is the last Skywalker. They’re not going to end his story and blood line as a super evil villain. THAT would be what would destroy the legacy of all the other characters. Also it would make all his development in the trilogy pointless.

How I would have written The Last Jedi (long version). Part 1 V1.1,"Verion 1.0 can be found here with all comments 

[Version 1.0] https://old.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/8vgidd/how_i_would_have_written_the_last_jedi_long/

Here is Version 1.1.

Quick intro: I really wanted to love TLJ.  I think it could have been one of the most epic SW movies, plots, stories ever.  Unfortunately it was not so.  But enough of that.  Its in the past.  Here is my rewriting of TLJ.  You'll have to use your imagination, as this is a plot outline and not a story.  (parentheses are my commentary)

Opening Scene:

Roll the SW logo.  SW music and fanfare.  Roll the opening crawl. 

Episode VIII
The Last Jedi
The force has awakened, now more then ever the galaxy needs the Jedi to return and to restore peace and order.  

Two years have passed since the destruction of Star Killer Base and as a result the First Order has suffered a tremendous loss at the hands of the Resistance.  Rey having journeyed to find Luke Skywalker has committed herself to the training of the Jedi.  While Kylo Ren has gone further down the path of the dark side under the guidance of supreme ruler Snoke.  

In the outer rim the Resistance is amassing support from what is left of the galactic federation to put a stop once and for all to The First Order.  But little do they know of the power of the dark side.  System by system The First Order conquers and rebuilds, reunited under a new power.  One that has not been seen in the galaxy for a very, very long time... (this is foreshadowing for revealing Snoke as Plagueis)

(pan down from text crawl and stars to a 3 planet solar system.)

Text on screen: Rakata Prime (RP)
We are shown a planet.  We are shown a massive ship silhouette moving towards the planet.  We are shown a planetary shield.  (not unlike Rogue One) We are shown inside the planetary control center of this new planet, all crew are dead, but no signs of a struggle.  Screens show the ship near the planet.  Two last crew members are alive.  They are the commanding officer and his second in command.  A computer glitch is shown on the main screen.  Then a menacing holographic image of a Hux appears.  (this is like TLJ where Snoke appears and smacks Hux around).  

The RP Commander Speaks ""Identify yourself, you’re presence in orbit is not...""  He is then force chocked/lifted by an invisible force and dies like the rest of the crew.  Now Admiral Hux appears and speaks ""This is Admiral Hux of The First Order.  Lower your shields.  Prepare to surrender to supreme leader Snoke.”  
The second in command is shown looking towards his fallen commander as he types on a screen in front of him.  A power reducing noise is heard and a graphic of shield lowering shown.  The second in command is then immediately force chocked to death.  Leaving everyone in the control center dead.  We are shown the planet and the shield coming down.  We are shown the large ship moving forward closer to the planet now.  We are shown a large number of indistinct ships leaving the larger ship and moving down towards the planet surface.

(I wanted to show how absolutely merciless the First Order is.  And also introduce the new power of dark side.  TLJ made the FO look like fools.  This makes them look like a destructive force for the dark side.  Get ready to use your imagination)

We are shown a massive landing area in the main city on this planet.  Thousands of RP troops and personnel are gathered around the landing area.  We are shown a unique transport ship landing with several flanking attack ships.  All landing in unison.  Music swells up, dark and deep and menacing.  Doors open on the transport ship. Out walks the Knights of Ren one by one down the stairs onto the platform.  They form a row on each side in the military style.  Slowly out walks Snoke, limping, looking weak and frail.  He stops.  We see him head on, full body at the top of the steps of the transport ship.  He speaks ""My son, come.""  (Ren is obviously not his son, but we will see Snoke take on the role of father for Kylo.  This is a tie into Kylo killing Han his real father.  More on this later.)  From behind him walks out Kylo.  He has the same mask and outfit as in TFA, but its dirty and battered.  He walks forward.  Now we see him from behind.  Where he was cut down by Rey he now has what looks like reinforcing technology covering up his spine.  This is due to his wound.  He is slightly crouched.  Kylo walks down the steps and out in front of the Knights of Ren.  We are shown the RP personnel.  Snoke follows him down.  Snoke comes and stands behind him and gestures to the side at an FO officer.  The FO officer plays a recording letting all of the RP troops know the FO are going to take over the planet.  Kylo stands unmoving.   As the voice plays, we see a wide view of the planet with many FO ships landing.  The voice speaks slowly and with intent. “This planet now belongs to the First Order.  You are now in our servitude and ownership.  Let this serve as a warning to all those who wish to resist.”  We are shown the faces of the crew.  Most scared.  Some defiant.  We are shown Snoke standing behind Kylor.  Snoke reaches out and touches Kylo on the back of the shoulder.   Snoke “My son, whos thoughts betray us here on this planet?”   Kylo stands up straight, mechanical noises resonate from his back, he stretches his hands out to his side.  He slowly starts to lift them up in front of him, palms upwards, fingers towards the sky.  As he does we are show a wide angle of the entire RP personnel.  Of the many thousands, some hundreds are lifted up in the air, force chocked.  We are shown Kylo, his posture fixed unmoving.  He then drops his hands as though little effort was expended.  All those lifted and chocked are dropped back down dead.  We are shown the same faces of the crew, now missing the defiant ones.  Snoke “Good my son.  Your training has come a long way.”  Snoke and Kylo return to the ship.

We are shown the bridge of the large dark ship.  Hux standing middle of the ship overlooking the planet. The FO commanding officers are looking at a map of the galaxy.  One presses a button as he looks down on the planet.  The dot turns from red to green.  We pan out on the galactic map to reveal many many green dots in a sort of path.  As though they have been conquering a whole arm of the galaxy.  (this is connected to the Leia scene coming up)

(Also this scene helps bridge the gap between TFA and TLJ.  In TFA Starkiller Base is destroyed and seemingly severely hurt the FO.  Now we see how the FO is rising up to power.  Also add some serious menace to the FO.  Also shows that Snoke/Kylo are using the force to take over planets and rebuild the FO after TFA.  Also shows Kylo is now able to use the force to larger extent then we’ve seen in the past with any Jedi, Sith or anyone really.  Which itself dwarfs Snoke/Pleguis power.  I felt TFA already moved up the force power scale really quickly, so we could only go up from there)

We cut to a somber orchestral song.   Its overcast and raining in the early morning.  We are shown the island where Luke resides.  (if you remember the trailer for TLJ where we see a drone shot of the island.  That’s one of the views we see.  Actually watch the trailer again and listen to that song.  Amazing.  https://youtu.be/Q0CbN8sfihY?t=27s )  We move closer to the island.  Rain is intense.  We see Rey fighting an impossibly fast foe with Lukes lightsaber.  We are not shown the foe, just hints.   She fights up, stairs, cliff’s, strikes stone and plants, stumbles, falls, uses simple force powers like push and pull.  She is exhausted, flustered, angry, defiant.  She is fighting now on a narrow cliff path, above a high cliff edge at the opening of a cave.  At the bottom jagged rocks and crashing waves.   She swings Luke’s lightsaber violently sticking the stone walls.  As she reaches back for a large swing, Luke’s hand is shown gesturing, (slow motion) lightsaber shuts off in Rey’s hands.  (normal motion) She is distracted by this.  Her left foot gets visibly pushed back by a force push.  The lightsaber ripped from her hands, it flies into the dark of the cave.  Her right shoulder also gets force pushed back.  She stumbles backwards towards the edge of the cliff.  As she is about to fall backwards, Luke reaches out and grabs her hand with his robotic hand.   Pulls her in.  She stands defeated, keeled over hands on he knees.  Then falls to her knees.

Luke’s voice from the cave “You must not fight in anger.  You will never win.”  Luke steps forward from the dark cave.  A great beautiful Luke Skywalker fatherly smile across his face.  He walks past her towards the edge of the cliff, then a more serious tone as he speaks and looks out to the ocean.  Luke “I sense the force is strong with you.  You are of the Jedi mind, but not of the Jedi heart.   You fight too with anger and rage you insist on winning too much.”  Rey exhausted, rain falling on her drenched body, she lifts her head and looks into the cave “I don’t know what else to do to win master Luke.”  Luke “In all of the time you have been here I have taught you the technique of the Jedi, but you yourself must learn the way of the Jedi.  You see your past and look to fight for your future.  But you are lost in the present.”   Rey “What else must I do? What training is there left for me?”  Luke kneels down to her, takes her hand to lift her up “There is none.”  Luke lifts her up.  She stands in front of him looking down.  He looks at her.  She looks up.  Luke “A Jedi does not win because of the Force, he wins with the Force.  You must learn not to just use the force, you must learn to become one with the Force.  To do so you must learn to be in the moment.“ He removes his perfectly dry rag cloth coat and drapes it around her.  Luke “Comon, lets see what Chewy has cooked up for us this morning.”  As they walk away and through the area where Rey seemingly trained, we see massive damage to the walls and plant life.  Like scratches on a prison wall, we see saber strikes and destroyed stone and cut down trees.  Rey’s power with the force is substantial.  

(There was no reason to start the story right after the events of TFA.  There was no reason to actually show Luke training Rey.  TFA had a really great cliffhanger.  So it really sucks to pass it by.   I wanted to focus more on her transition to a full master, then go from there.  We already see her being very powerful and skilled in TFA.  So no reason to go back now.   And anyway we already know how the Jedi training happens from The Empire Strikes Back.  I wanted to take the Jedi and push them even further beyond the powers of a normal Jedi master.  (You’ll see what I mean later.)

We wipe cut to the galactic core.  We see a massive sun encompassed by a partial Dyson Sphere (google it).  We pan to a land mass on the inner wall of the sphere.  We pan down to an island floating above a perfectly round lake on the inner wall.   Filling up the majority of the island is an alien yet familiar coliseum type structure.  As we move closer we see what looks to be a massive crowd on the outside of the coliseum.  Towards the inside are thousands of spikes.  As we move closer, at the tip of each spike sits a senator of alien origin.  What I want to show in this scene is Leia being introduced to the galactic council, as she speaks her spike stays put, but the rest of them lowering.  Shows that the galaxy respects her greatly and what she has to say.   Leia begins by saying this is her first and will be the only appeal to the galaxy core council.   Established after the destruction caused by the FO.  Warns of the FO and asks that a vote be taken.  A vote to show who will support an initiative to fight back against the ever growing threat of the FO.   Each tip of each spike starts to light up red.  Very few green, showing little support for her.  Frustrated she speaks again.  She warns that the FO is driven by the dark side.  “You will not vote because of complacency and selfishness.  You will not vote because of ignorance or willful disregard. But will you vote out of fear and desperation.  Our enemy is not the FO, but the dark side which drives it.  The empire is gone and defeated.  But the FO is not the empire.  They do not seek order and control.  Right now they are capturing the outer rim of the galaxy.  They are consolidating power and will soon surround the core.   Will you vote when your worlds burn at the will of the dark side?  Will you vote when all hope is lost in the galaxy?  And fear rules and the dark side reigns?  Will you vote then?”  (I would have loved to have seen Carrie Fisher as the rebellious, hard headed, stubborn, willful, strong Leia Organa one more time.  Instead we got purple haired lady. Oh well.) We see the tips of the spikes from behind Leia as she finishes her speech.   One red light turns green, then more and more.  We see a wider view of the entire coliseum.  Until all are green.   We focus back on Leia as she gesture she is done.  She is weak from the exertion.  She seems frail and old and worn out.  Symphonic music builds up, soft, classical, elegant.   No more ambient noises are heard, just music.  We see her taken to a large ship, then into a viewing room inside the ship, that oversees part of the coliseum and something that looks like a space port.  We see ships amassing.  Focus back on Leia, she looks frail still.  A droid attends to her, she waves it off.  We are then shown a montage of large fleets beings assembled.   Back to Leia, we see her reaching out.  She reaches to a holoprojector on the table near her.  She presses a button.  A young Ben and Han stand in 3D (like “You are our only hope Obi Wan”), they seem to be posing.  Lei turns it off after some time.  Focus on her face as she looks on, tears welling up in her eyes but no tears come down.

(These are the first three introductions.  FO and Luke/Rey and Leia/The Rebelion.  The rest is just simple plot.  I wanted the movie to start off grim, dark and heavy.   I wanted to set the chess pieces and the stakes.  This is not in line with how SW is, but I wanted to set the stakes.  TFA didn’t really do that.)

"The ST didn't ""erase"" the victories of the OT.","At least not yet.  Throughout TFA and TLJ, it looks like we're moving towards the ""undoing"" of the OT, but I don't think that'll be the ultimate outcome.  In the end, the next generation will step up and destroy the First Order before they can truly solidify their grip on the galaxy.

What's interesting to me is that the ""loss"" of Ben Solo created a domino effect that has placed the galaxy in the shape it's in today.  Han and Leia wanted their son to train with Luke because they were scared of the darkness within him.  Luke's attempt to restore the Jedi Order was left in ruins when he couldn't prevent his nephew from succumbing to the darkness.  Without the Jedi, the First Order was given the space they needed to rise up and destroy the New Republic's capital system.  And now, the First Order is in the process of claiming the throne of power in the galaxy.

The victories of the OT are unraveling, but there is hope.  TLJ ended with that spark of hope being reignited.  So while the First Order may bully the galaxy around for a bit in IX, it won't last very long.  The good guys will win.  The victories of the OT will endure.  One (albeit significant) hiccup along the way won't change that.

How Does Starkiller Know How to Use Force Lightning?,"Before anyone asks, I like Starkiller/ Galen Marek. I think he was a great addition to the Star Wars. There's one thing that's always bothered me about him though, and that's his ability to use force lightning. While it is possible for any force user to perform the technique, it usually requires either learning from a master, or experiencing the technique firsthand in order to use it ( I could be wrong about this). Vader physically cannot perform it, I'm pretty sure Palpatine couldn't have divulged the secret to Vader's 'secret' apprentice, and there's no one else with the knowledge pertaining to it, so unless Vader got a hold of sith holocrons or texts that detail the technique, I don't see how Starkiller can do it.

[Spoiler] I didn’t like Solo. I can explain.,"I’ve had a month to think about it, and now I can confidently say I did not care for Solo. The movie was a huge letdown. I like it less and less as time goes on. I know that’s an unpopular opinion, and I’m open to changing my mind. I wanted to love this movie. I really did. Han Solo is probably my favorite character in all of Star Wars and I’ve always wanted to see more of his life. But this movie has so many flaws that poked holes in my enjoyment of it.

I will list a few of the big ones. I only saw the movie once so forgive me if I get some detail wrong, but here you go:

1.	It does a lot of annoying prequel stuff. Did we really need an explanation for why Chewbacca is sometimes called Chewie? Was anybody wondering about that? Is anybody satisfied with Han getting the name “Solo” because he was alone? It was much cooler when you didn’t know if that was his birth name, a name he made up to sound cool, etc. 

2.	 In Solo, we see that Han can speak some of the Wookiee language. But he never does it again in any other Star Wars movie? What’s up with that?

3.	 The Kessel Run sequence, in addition to ruining one of the great unanswered questions in Star Wars, was a huge letdown. So they had to dodge some space debris and escape a giant monster? Where have we seen that before?

4.	Woody Harrelson and Thandie Newton are set up as this inseparable couple that do everything together, but then she dies and a minute later he’s like, “Welp, see you guys later.” No impact at all. 

5.	L3, Lando’s droid/companion, wants to start a rebellion for droids that are enslaved across the galaxy and even convinces a lot of droids to fight along with her, implying that they all are self-aware and would prefer freedom, a fact that is weirdly played for laughs even though it makes events in the other Star Wars movies horrifically cruel if you think about it. Even worse, when her body dies, her mind is made a part of the Millennium Falcon. In other words, she will now be enslaved in this ship for as long it exists, without any free will and unable to even speak. This is an extremely dark fate for a droid that wanted freedom for herself and others, but the movie acts like it’s supposed to be heartwarming.",StarWars,True,1529610781,2018-06-21

How much did Disney pay for this editorial,"&gt;Did you hear? *The Last Jedi* is an Objectively Bad Movie.

&gt;Never mind that it raked in $1.3 billion worldwide to become the [11th highest grossing film of all time](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/) (and second most successful Star Wars film ever), or that it was a critical sensation with a [91&amp;#37; score on Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_the_last_jedi/). *The Last Jedi* is bad because a bunch of angry dudes with tiny Twitter follower numbers say so!

The reddit-verse and others have theorized that Snoke rose to match Luke's lightside power, and create balance in the universe. This is also evidenced by the fact that they die within a few minutes of each other.

I REALLY don't understand why people want an OBI WAN KENOBI movie so desperately.,"I feel like I am in the minority here when I say that find the idea of a Kenobi spin-off film one of the least appealing ideas I have heard. I'll try to explain why I can't wrap my head around this becoming in any way a movie that I want to see, however I don't want to convince you that a Kenobi film is a shit idea, rather I hope you can explain to me why you personally think it is a good idea.

1: We already saw Ewan Kenobi in three films

The main reason I see is that people just love Ewan as Obi Wan. And I agree, he's great. He's one of the best parts of the prequel movies (IMO the best thing is Palpatine), and seeing more of him would indeed be great. However just seeing more of something that is already there is not enough on itself. It's fun for the first time but ultimately forgettable. We have already seen Ewan Kenobi in three movies, what can they ad more?

2: He's physically in the same location for 20 years

Here's where the big problem comes in. At the ending of Revenge of the Sith Obi Wan is pretty much in the same place as where he is in the beginning of A New Hope. Whatever happens in this movie can't make any impact in the universe because we know his exile was successful. The Empire, Vader, etc. none of them knew Kenobi was on tattooine watching over Luke. At no point can anything of giant consequences happen in this movie and at no point will we feel any tension regarding it because we know nothing like it will happen.

3: We already know the beginning of the end of his Spiritual/mental journey, and we know what caused it

There's quite a character difference between Episode III Kenobi and Episode IV Kenobi, he goes from pretty witty young man to a wise old sage. Being in desolation changes a lot to a person. This character change would obviously be the main arc of the movie, but is it a story that needs to be told?  By seeing both EPisode III and IV we can already fill in the gap in our mind, we know what the regret and loneliness have done to him, do we really need to see that happening?  Does every single aspect need to be told and can we not leave something just open to our own interpretation?

4: Tatooine is in 5 movies already

For real, there's nothing new to discover on that rock. 

So to conclude, I just don't find it appealing because it's stuff we already know, combined with stuff we have already seen. The only way I would find it appealing is if Bela Tarr directs it and it's a 7 hour long movie with Ewan just walking through the Desert and having existential conversations with space aliens.

Star Wars Declines,"I personally feel like the new main story line of Star Wars has been so disappointing because we went from 6 films by a single director and creator to a corporation trying to piggy back off of it to make money. Stand alones Solo and Rogue One have been great because there is already some backstory, Enough to build a interesting plot around. Sadly Disney plunging forward has fallen flat because there hasn’t been enough continuity in the development. Multiple directors with deferent takes and stories to tell. It’s almost feel like these two moves are from two different parallel universes and not even the same plot anymore.  

I accepted TFA and honestly enjoyed it. I bought into the new direction hoping the gaps would be filled in and answers would come through the next two films. Then TLJ belly flopped off the high dive... I just can’t help but feel TLJ has crippled this new trilogy. Part #9, the next movie, really needs to answer a lot of questions and revive interest.

"""Fanservice"" and ""Giving Fans what they want"" are not the same thing.","There has been some confusion over this lately, so allow me to explain the difference.

Fanservice is designed to appeal to nostalgia or rule of cool.  It feels good to watch, but is usually inconsequential or even outright meaningless.  For example, if they made a spinoff movie where Darth Vader got into a fight with Maul, that would be fanservice, because it would be awesome as hell, but it wouldn't serve any real purpose because we know the fight is ultimately not going to advance the plot or tell us anything about the characters we don't already know.

""Giving fans what they want"" on the other hand, is simple.  It means merely making content the fans will enjoy.  If there's a lot of demand for a movie about Obi-Wan Kenobi, then making a movie about Obi-Wan Kenobi is giving fans what they want.

Now, these might sound similar.  But what fans want and fanservice are not necessarily the same thing.  Let me give you an example.  The Force Awakens is a very fanservice-laden movie.  It's full of callbacks and references to the OT.  That's fanservice.  But prior to the release of TFA, if you had asked fans what they wanted Episode 7 to be like, do you think many of them would have said ""A remake of ANH, where the heroes are Rebels again for some reason and the Empire is back in power and there's another Death Star""?  Of course not.  They'd have wanted something new.  Something that actually moves the plot forward.

Honest Question: Will these new films ever be better than the OT?,"***I come in peace, and I hope I can promote some good discussions.***

* **First**: *I am not here to bash on the ST or the Anthology films. In fact, I am content and happy about these new films*

* ***Second:*** *I know the question is very broad and the fanbase is so large that some may enjoy TFA more than ROTJ or TLJ better than ANH. Or maybe Rogue One or Solo is one of their favorites. Also, I'm aware there are also fans that put ROTS as their favorite (IMO, its too dark and its sad to watch Anakin turn... that's why I don't really watch it). The point is that everyone in this fanbase ranks their film differently.*

**My thoughts**:

I'm part of the generation that ""grew up"" with the Prequel Trilogy; however, I grew up more with the OT, which is why they sit above all the other Star Wars films. Now, as I stated above, I am happy and content with these new films. ***But in my mind, I feel like even if they make the next ESB or ANH, or my favorite ROTJ.. I will simply always like/love the OT more and rank them higher.*** Now this maybe for nostalgic reason, but I think I will always give the OT the... I guess advantage over any other Star Wars film because... well it was Original and the ones that started this huge fanbase that loves these films and are passionate about. I'm pretty much open to whatever Star Wars film that comes out... but without a doubt, for me at least, it will just never be better than the OT.

Star Wars fans are the worst.,"We all love this magnificent franchise that we call Star Wars. We’ve grown up with it, it’s developed, evolved, there have been ups and downs but ultimately, our love for the show lives on. The one thing that constantly drags the franchise down in my eyes (and this has been very apparent recently) is the fans. They have given Kelly Marie Tran so much hate that she has left instagram, they’ve made Daisy Ridley Delete her Instagram account, even more recently, they boycotted Solo which has lead to the both the Obi-Wan and Boba Fett films to be put on hold. I’m not saying that it’s peoples fault they don’t like the franchises recent instalments, I’m saying that the reason it’s been falling short recently in TLJ and Solo is because the negative and hateful reaction has started to have its collateral effect on the films, the fans and even the goddamn actors. The way that people treat Star Wars now takes away from what younger people can gain from the new films, do we not want them to get the same joy as when you first watched a new hope? 

Of course I’m open to any thoughts and discussion, of course this isn’t targeted at all Star Wars fans, I know there are so many that treat this franchise with the respect it deserves (despite not liking the recent instalments!)

I had heard the story was just okay and didn't really stand out.

I believe this is incorrect. When following Iden Virso, the main character, You see the ending of the Empire and how the roots of the First Order emerge. I think the story in the game does a great job at showing how the First Order got so powerful when as the viewer, the last we saw of the Empire was the Death Star II being blown up.

A question about the 10 year reign of Palpatine between the Phantom Menace and the Clone wars.,"Hi guys, So i felt like going for a star wars movie marathon. 

I haven't done this in a while and the last time i watched them i didn't know nearly as much as i do now about the canon etc.

My question is this. 

The chancellor of the republic can only have 2 4 year terms and rule for a total of 8 years. Now ofcourse Palpy manipulated everyone to give himself emergency powers in AOTC but there is a 10 year gap between his election to the chancellorship and his initiating of the emergency powers.

How is it that he managed to stay on for 10 years (2 years longer than he was allowed to) without the emergency powers ? 

I know the Naboo Crisis was used by him to get rid of Valorum and make himself chancellor but i dont think that is enough for him to then go and say ""Hey remember how bad Naboo was you guys should give me more time as chancellor"" and take another 2 years on top :P

"The Force Awakens, Abrams and Episode 9. Where do we go from here?","So before I say anything I'll say what my overall thoughts are on the ST movies just to get a grasp on where I stand:

The Force Awakens: Very entertaining, very well directed but with not much substance and a lacklustre plot. The characters make it worth watching. 7/10.

Rogue One: A decent action sequence that comes after over an hour of boring set-up, it's not well written and it's not very good. 5/10.

The Last Jedi: One of my favourites, feels like it finally does something fresh for the franchise, and continues the characters stories in interesting ways, all while delivering on an emotional and thematic level too. The best ST movie so far. 9/10.

Solo: Better than it has any right to be, but still only just okay. It's a fun romp and it knows it, the casting helps this one a lot. 6/10.

Now that's out the way and I've guaranteed the TLJ hate comments, I need to talk about TFA. As a first film in a trilogy, it is bloody awful. It wastes any opportunity it has to show us the new state of the galaxy that the First Order and Resistance operate in, and disregards that in favour of a soft-reboot style plot that mirrors A New Hope. I often see criticism on this sub and elsewhere online that TLJ disregarded a lot of what TFA set up and retroactively ruined it, where I see it that by taking the story direction Abrams did for TFA, he shot the entire trilogy in the foot before it had even begun.

So what was set up in TFA that has to do with plot and world-building?

* The New Republic exists
* Rey was left on Jakku by her parents
* Kylo has an imposing looking mentor called Snoke
* Luke is hiding away on an island
* Kylo and Luke have a past together
* Kylo needs to 'finish his training'
* Rey is incredibly powerful with the force

By the end of TFA, the *only* plot thread we have to go into TLJ with is the fourth point there; Luke is on an island, the Resistance need him, why is he there? There's no semblance of an over-arching narrative to do with any grand story because Abrams did not set one up. TFA could have been anything, but because it leaned far too heavily into the past it did an awful job at giving us a reason to care about the state of the Galaxy, the Republic, the Resistance and the First Order, and made whoever's job it was to make the sequel much harder.

So then how does TLJ build on these setups?

* The New Republic was destroyed in TFA and never explained in that film, never explained in this one as it's a bit too late.
* Rey's parents were nobodies. It's important to remember here that the important part for Rey's character is her parents physical act of leaving her, TFA doesn't really tease their identities, it just reminds us of that act to remind us of Rey's flaws. I think the fanbase (myself included) just assumed they'd be someone important because Star Wars has relied on that trope for a long time.
* Snoke isn't explained. I don't mind this but if you do then I get it completely.
* Luke is on the island because he made a mistake, and almost acted out in fear, which led to the destruction of his academy and the rise of a new dark side force user. So a lot of people don't like what Rian did with Luke in TLJ, but seriously how else could it have gone? Why did you think he was hiding there while watching TFA? If Rey had got there and he just agreed to join her and help straight away it would make his hiding out there for all of TFA completely pointless. Luke on the island was an Abrams mystery box that sounded cool but he didn't have an answer for. Johnson took it, applied an answer that made sense for the actions the character took to cut himself off from the galaxy and it works as payoff from the last film. What did you all think he was taking a holiday?
* Kylo and Luke's past is built upon, and is key to a lot of the film.
* Kylo does kind of do this? You could see him defeating Snoke as the completion of his training.
* Rey is still very powerful with the force. ""Darkness rises, and light to meet it"". To me, Rey is the conduit for the light side of the force, she's a character with a 'destiny' that has been thrust into the Skywalker story by chance, I like it.

So by the end of The Last Jedi we've had a lot of purely character drama, character exploration and growth and changing circumstances for the Resistance (extremely small now but they seem amped to fight the First Order again after having been nearly destroyed, one thing TLJ does great is it really feels like the Resistance is on its absolute last legs before Luke returns to restore the spark). But still, not much wider plot, partly because of its focus on character, and partly because it had absolutely nothing to build off from TFA. Sometimes I do wish TLJ had been the first film in the trilogy, because at this point TFA feels like it completely wasted its opportunity to be the first act of a narrative, it's the first act of a story we've already seen.

So what does Episode 9 need to do to deliver a satisfying end to this story? It needs to be focused on characters, it needs to be personal and it needs to show us Rey, Kylo, Finn and Poe pushed to their limits. It needs to (as TLJ did) frame the wider conflict in the characters, and show us how their relationships change. We need to see what Rey's plan is next, does she still want to convert Kylo? Is Kylo still tempted by the light? Can Poe be a good leader without Leia? Can Finn do something interesting? (Ha ha Canto Bight).

This has been pretty long and rambling but I hope what I'm trying to say kind of gets through. TFA is not a good setup for a three film story, and I believe that the day the Sequel Trilogy's overarching plot was doomed was not on TLJ release day, but when Abrams decided 'mirroring' A New Hope would be a good idea. By leaning too much on nostalgia and the past, Abrams fucked this new story from the start, and ultimately created the response to nostalgic filmmaking that TLJ was.

TL;DR: The Force Awakens is a bad first act for the new trilogy, Abrams missed the mark from the start.

Disclaimer: I really enjoy both TFA and TLJ, and despite me going a bit hard on TFA's story elements here it is a really well made film, and I'm looking forward to seeing Abram's direction and shots in Episode 9. If there is any discussion about what I've said then I would love for it to be as civil as possible, please don't give me shit because I like Luke in TLJ, I'm very interested in Star Wars at the moment as a franchise and as a product, and would love to spark some proper discussion that doesn't devolve into shit-talking.",StarWars,True,1529660774,2018-06-22
The difference between Star Wars and Comic Book Universes,"I'm not expert on Marvel or DC especially the most recent movies, have not seen them all.

However, there's a very important distinction that general fans of Star Wars, especially new ones, need to understand. *Star Wars* is and always has been a *single* *universe,* where every movie that comes out is part of the ""Canon"" and part of that legitimate single mythology. 

\-

Yes, that's only 6 movies.

Yes, there are some discrepancies between movies.

But in *Star Wars* fandom, you, the fan, do not get to pick and choose which movies are part of *your* canon. This is very different than Marvel or DC movies, which have been coming out for decades now (Batman, Batman Forever, Batman vs Superman, All the Spider-Man movies, etc).   
What this also means is that any fan of Star Wars owes it to themselves to actually see the Original Trilogy because it is the genesis of all Star Wars canon, the genesis of the Star Wars mythology.

\-

What this also, also means is that SW movie creators have a different ""contract"" with the fanbase than what they would have with a Comic based movie. Those creators *are expected* to fit their story and their world into the preexisting ""Canon"" of *Star Wars*. Yes, this principle applies to a few recent releases, but it also applies to all new Star Wars movies coming out. 

We ""the people,"" the fans that have supported Star Wars merchandise for decades expect that the new Star Wars movies will fit into that singular Mythology of the brand, or else what you are creating is just not *Star Wars*. This isn't the same thing as super heroes and caped crusaders, it's like reading one giant book all with interrelated characters and consequences. Now if a Star Wars movie was created OUTSIDE of the Canon timeline, of course there could be all kinds of ""liberties"" with the story and characters, *everything would be relatively independent* from the start. I would personally welcome that, but this post isn't *about me or my opinion*. It's about respecting the SW Mythology as a single universe, which fans have been doing since *Star Wars* first came out in 1977.",StarWars,True,1529662588,2018-06-22

Galactic Battlegrounds: A Story of Tragedy (x/post /r/StarWarsGames),"**TL;DR at the bottom**

So with the recent Steam Sales, I decided to pick up Galactic Battlegrounds. If you haven't heard of it, it's an early 2000s game made by Ensembles Studios (the guys who made Age of Empires) and because of that, it's basically just Age of Empires but Star Wars in almost every way. 

After completing the tutorial and the first few missions of the Droid Campaign, I decided to go ahead with a custom match. Big map, 4 players (1 human, 3 AI). And of course, the best faction to play as would be the Empire (go Vader!) The gamemode I chose was ""Terminate the Commander"". Every team has a commander. If their commander dies, their team loses. For me, my commander was Vader. 

It started out smoothly at first. Managing resources, scouting the area. Construction farms, training troops, suffering an ore crisis before I found another ore vein. I did have the odd Rebel or Wookiee scout come into my area, but it was nothing serious. The main problems arose later in the game. My Empire was in a good place, with carbon and nova crystals being plentiful, and food being harvested by the hundreds. There was an ore crisis about to start since all of my ore was about to run out... but I decided to worry about it later. A mistake.

The Wookiee Faction attacked from the east, and the Naboo from the south. It was my first type of attack in this game, so I did not expect them to just come blasters blazing, shooting down my buildings. After this encounter, I went ahead and built some walls. Put down some turrets and anti-aircraft turrets, re-positioned troopers near the workers and walls, and I was sure the empire was good to go. At this time, I also managed to build a shipyard - which if I hadn't made, then I would have died within the next half an hour. 

The Naboo, the Wookiees, and the Rebels all arrived on my doorstep. All within 10 minutes of each other. The walls were torn down, the buildings burnt - but Vader? Thanks to the shipyard that was built earlier, Vader, 2 workers, and 2 stormtroopers managed to escape in the nick of time with a Troop Transport, alongside a few TIE ships. These units were all that was needed to start a new life. Eventually, I managed to settle down in a small isolated island. \[Screenshot of it here.\]([https://imgur.com/EOFFIra](https://imgur.com/EOFFIra)) I rebuilt a few buildings, but now I needed ore! The same resource I needed earlier! As it turns out, workers are invulnerable to being attacked, unless they attacked something first. So I used this handy tool to steal some ore from the neighboring Naboo faction. 

At this point, my empire was still getting destroyed by everyone. \[One screenshot of it here,\]([https://imgur.com/a4cHlA3](https://imgur.com/a4cHlA3)) another one of \[it here.\]([https://imgur.com/JyzEXaq](https://imgur.com/JyzEXaq)) I ended up successfully stealing the ore, but now the problem was that my workers with the much-needed ore couldn't get to the island because it was surrounded by water! So the next best thing in my mind? Build an ore deposit right next to the island! 

**Bad mistake.** 

Because of how close my deposit building was to the Naboo, they immediately detected it and \[absolutely annihilated my new base\]([https://imgur.com/8R1hgeF](https://imgur.com/8R1hgeF)), with me managing to escape again. But with my base gone, little room to start again and a lack of resources, I just decided to give Vader and the remainign troops a fitting end by having him \[charge in the rebel base, lightsaber and blasters blazing.\]([https://imgur.com/5t6Ra4x](https://imgur.com/5t6Ra4x)) It ended up being a 2 hour long match, but god damn that was fun. \[End screen\]([https://imgur.com/ug9GEMP](https://imgur.com/ug9GEMP))

How Snoke could still factor into IX.,"I'm not saying I want this to happen, but I think it could be interesting.

Maybe Snoke was the precursor to a larger invasion from the Unknown Regions.  His species had been planning on invading the galaxy for decades, but they knew they couldn't stand against Palpatine's Empire or against the New Republic (with Luke Skywalker still out there).  

So when the Imperial Remnant retreated into the Unknown Regions, they sent Snoke to take command of them and ""pave the way"" for a quick and easy invasion.  But now that Kylo has betrayed him, they need to just lead an all-out assault.

While the First Order and Resistance jockey for control of the galaxy, Snoke's people makes their move.  This forces the heroes and villain to create a temporary alliance and save the galaxy.  When the conflict is finished, a new order could be created.  

Again, I'm not saying this is what I want.  But I think it could take the franchise in an unexpected direction.  One that wouldn't seem like a rehash of RotJ.",StarWars,True,1529673263,2018-06-22

About the anthology films,"What does everyone think about the anthology films? If the rumors of kenobi, lando or boba fett are true then I will be very disappointed. These Disney era of Star Wars movies lean way too heavily on nostalgia. I’ve already seen obi-wan in 5 other Star Wars movies. I’ve seen lando, I’ve seen Han Solo. The one that I suppose you could make an argument for is boba fett but I never understood his appeal. I liked solo, but not because it was Han Solo. I liked seeing the criminal underworld, I liked the grimy and war torn planets, I liked the western tones. I want more of that. Rogue one was original, it was a story we haven’t seen with new characters(minus a few cameos). I just think the anthology films are a perfect opportunity to expand the universe of Star Wars and introduce new ideas,characters,worlds, but instead Disney want to just cash out on our nostalgia. I may just be ranting tho",StarWars,True,1529676014,2018-06-22
Has a clone/droid ever looted and wielded a lightsaber from a fallen Jedi/Sith?,"Of course droids are mostly programmed to do one thing and that's follow orders, but the same could almost be said of the clones to an extent.

The clones, unlike the droids, are trained humans and are probably pretty prone to improv situations. Imagine a droid being disarmed. Bluescreen, right? GG, it's not like their scrawny little wires will do anything to a hella pissed off 6'3 kung-fu fighter.

Now, imagine a clone being disarmed. He could probably go hand-to-hand for at least a little bit, maybe mimicking the Jedi's hand-to-hand style, assuming they're both disarmed because otherwise the Jedi would just slice 'em in half.

Overall, I think that a clone would be much more likely to make a dash towards a killed force user's light saber, especially if disarmed/away from a group and unprotected, left with the option to either give it a whirl or literally die.

I have absolutely no idea how a droid would handle a situation like this. A.I. is good and all, but the droids are a radio hivemind, right? Something would have to see the droid's situation out of millions of other droids and manually override it remotely to go pick up the lightsaber, or the self-preservation protocol would kick in, using experimental autopilot gizmodos to try to assess and react to the present need to go loot some dudes. Or who knows, maybe they'd just let that tactical advantage go to waste.",StarWars,True,1529678185,2018-06-22

Selflessness and Sith,"I was thinking the other day that the Order of the Sith Lords created by Darth Bane is in some respects a code of selflessness.

We know that Sith desire power and are selfish beyond measure since their goal is to enslave and rule over the whole galaxy. However, the Sith that did become masters knew that sooner or later they would be killed in order to continue serving the Sith order. We see that in Revenge of the Sith as well, when Sidious tells Yoda that Vader would become more powerful than either of them. So, that implies that Sidious puts the Sith ahead of himself and he is already prepared for his death. Doesn’t sound that selfish to me?

Perhaps, that is the similarities than Palpatine told Anakin about between Jedi and Sith.

The Numbers updates Blu-Ray sales for TLJ. Selling st higher pace than Rogue One.,"Nothing will compare to the box office or home box office success of the Force Awakens of the new Star Wars films but betraying a narrative of disinterest the box office edge that The Last Jedi had on the less divisive Rogue One seems to have continued into home sales as well. Third week DVD sales haven’t been posted yet but TLJ’s Blu-Ray sales through the first 3 weeks of release are 62 million in sales versus 50.3 for RO. 

Considering that NPD has TLJ still as the highest selling home release this year so far through May, and considering that TLJ has remained above Thor Ragnarok there, it’s reasonable to suspect that when the numbers updates up to June in a couple months we’ll see that those specifics remained above RO over that span, too.

Serious question about IX and beyond,"I have been wondering this for a few days now, ever since news broke that there were as many as 9 movies in the works along with the news that maybe everything is on hold.  Feelings about TLJ aside, how possible is it that they will be able to wrap up the entire ""story"" (using quotes since there really wasn't a solid plan in place and they are just going movie to movie aside from a few small threads) in IX in a very satisfactory manner?  

I'm starting to think that that might not be possible.  

My question- what are the chances that IX is expanded to X?  Not in a Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2 way, but just in a ""hey we need more time to tell this story and see it end properly so instead of a trilogy we are doing a quadrilogy""? Meaning they would have a story in place for IX with a beginning middle and end and then a few years later X would come out with its own beginning middle and end.

I totally get how silly this sounds, but part of me kind of hopes they do go in that direction so they can end this new story on a high note instead of forcing (pun totally intended) their conclusion in 1 film.  

Anyway, I had no one else to talk to about this and figured it could spark an interesting conversation here.  Happy Friday!",StarWars,True,1529695014,2018-06-22

All the respect to the creators and the Voice actor but Anakin in the show seems like a completely different person than Anakin portrayed in the prequels. It's just so weird because in Episodes 2 and 3 George Lucas made sure than the voice and acts of Anakin were in between the light and dark, didn't sound too upbeat but at the same time he didn't hiss his words with hatred. Then in TCW Anakin has a booming cheery voice and funny one-liners, which I don't mind comedy but save it for someone else. Then there's the way he acts. In Episodes 2 and 3 Anakin doesn't always seem compliant to doing the right thing, and is known for doing some bad stuff (i.e killing villages, marrying and decapitating an unarmed prisoner). In TCW, boy-scout Anakin will sabotage whatever he has to make sure he does at least 10 good deeds a day, and while this is what a Jedi should be portrayed like, Anakin was not meant to be shown as the ""cheery Samaritan of the galaxy"". The animation style in TCW is relatively consistent and most characters look like their live action counter parts...then Anakin again. This series begins a few months, maybe even few weeks after Episode 2 and apparently Anakin has a darker brown mullet and has fully matured into a new person...sorry, just something I noticed while watching TCW which sucks because Anakin is a main character.

After hearing so many differing opinions and reading various reviews, I kind of expected a mixed bag and to be more or less unsatisfied with the movie. 

Well, I was wrong. Is it perfect? No. However, the casting actually was on point (Glover as Lando, imitating Billy's voice and mannerisms, for example) and the storyline did have decent pacing. Was it slightly longer than it really needed to be? Yeah, but they covered a TON of material and it spans several different events. I really liked how they kinda delved into the other side of Star Wars that is often forgotten; the underworld and criminal syndicates.

I just finished my reread of Vector Prime and I loved it.,"Last summer I decided that I would spend that summer finally watching all of TCW having missed most of it when it aired. That fall I decided to read all the NEU books/comics for a post I was making while at the same time starting to reread all of the Legends books/comics (save for some things like Jedi Prince or Droids which dont' really count as canon). This summer I have decided to reread all of the NJO books. 

When I first read them as a kid in late middle school and my freshman year I hadn't read everything in Legends making some small things confusing. I also didn't read the all in order. While I tried to go by the timeline at the front of the book I could really only by what Books a million had. So I would end up reading some of the books way way out of order. 

This time though I went into Vector Prime with full knowledge of the EU from the lore books and having recently read from Bakura to the end of the YJK sereis. And even though I knew what was to come (or maybe because of it) I felt anxious. 

The first thing that shot out to me was this huge 20 book epic started off with three of the series main female characters. Now while Legends didn't do like the NEU and have a female character as the MC of the A or B plot in every book (for better or worse at times) it also didn't have a lack of female characters like some people said when TFA came out. 

And honestly I think Mara, Jaina, and Leia are done better in this book than many of the NEU's female characters have been done. Each one does great in the book and we are shown not just told how bad ass each one is. 

Mara Jade while undergoing a bioenginered caner is the first Jedi to kill a Vong warrior. Jaina solo outflies everyone in the novel with han heaping on tons of praise for her flying ability. Leia is shown to be a strong, competent, and wise leader if a little tired of politics at this point in her life. I loved every moment of the on screen. 

The guys weren't left out either. Jacen and his brother Anakin had a great philosophical argument that I wish the ST had explored. What is the role of the jedi and what is more important meditation or training. Anakin the younger one thinks Jedi should be led by a council, sent out on adventures, and should focus on physical pratice and using the force like a tool while his brother Jacen focuses on thinking Jedi should have the freedom to do what they wan't without a council and that they should focus more on their connection to it than physical training or pratice using it. 

Luke also has a great arc that will expand over the course of the series. With so many of his jedi (like Kyp Durron and his squadron) going out and doing their own thing and following the will of the force as they see it he has to decide if they need a council to better organize the knights and send them where they are needed most or leave them to follow their own paths. 

And this is on top of the politics where some politicians want the jedi reigned in either because they have ties to smugglers and are loosing money or because they see them as loose cannons and don't want another vader. 

Then on the outer rim we have a new invasion. A new enemy that has warriors coming in to spur up civil discord or blaze the way for their fleet. They use new tech that we don't really know or understand. And we have what I think is the most intersting bit of all, the NR refusing to head Leia's warning as worlds are destroyed or go dark and even as civilan and military ships are lost saying its just a small band of pirates or rebels and nothing to worry about. 

I know a lot of people dislike the YV and NJO but I love it and have loved this first book. I loved getting to see Han and Luke and Leia interact and getting to see their kids being awesome and doing most of the heroics. 

I liked the new tech and space battles and all of that. And I liked chewie die. In the NEU everyone but chewie dies and in Legends everyone but Chewie survives. ITs kind of funny that way. 

But the way he went out was cool. The Vong use a huge gravity well projector to drag a moon down onto the planet ( a trope called a colony drop, very popular in the Gundam universe) and Han, Chewie, and Anakin are there at the behest of Lando delivering some cargo. The moon starts to fall and we see Han leading the evacuation. Anakin and chewie are helping then at the last minuite when they are forced to leave Anakin is able to make it to the ship but chewie isn't and he has to make the decision of going back to get his friend or leaving him. 

And its a great scene not just because of how chewie goes out but what we see of han. Han is devistated by his best friend dieing and even goes so far as to blame his youngest son for it. Yet still in the next hour or so Han will be leading and organizing all the evacuees from the planet and making sure they escape. He works though it and doesn't go running and hiding (at least not yet but even then he doesn't leave leia)

Plus their are just so many cool ideas and parts to the story like everything in landos folly, the jedi battle meld, the slow death of the scientists on Helska. I really loved this book. 

Other than just the joy from reading this book I think another thing that has made me like this book even more is watching TFA and TLJ. TLJ has retroactively made me like TFA more because now I can at least respect what TFA was trying to set up and that it was a good base that could have went somewhere nice. 

Because as I'm reading this book I was thinking this is what I wanted to see in TFA. Not the whole NJO series. God knows their is no way to do 20 books in 3 movies. Even my preferred Legacy comic sereis couldn't be done in 3 movies. But it has ideas that I liked seeing here and wish had been explored or at least done better. 

For one their is something different about what we get in bloodlines and TFA than what we get in Vector Prime and Dark Tide. I guess because leia is still fighting her case and pulling away chuncks of the navy to help her instead of just being exiled for who her dad was and running a goup of a few dozen ships. 

I also love the Jedi stuff. While Luke would have had to take a much bigger back seat than he did in the NJO the idea of him having to weigh creating a council or letting jedi chose their own path, staying clear of politics due to what happened in the PT or playing the game, dealing with the question of is connection or training more important to a jedi. All of these things would have been great to see him tackle. As well as the future struggles that will come in the series like should the jedi fight (their were only a hundred at the time) or should they just help refugees escape? 

And the Vong. I know people find them to dark and edgy and what not. But the idea of this powerfull shadowy enemy that is slowly making planets go dark and setting up a foothold while the NR bickers amongst its self is just so much more intriging to me that what we got in the FO. In TFA the FO seemed like it was building up to be that plus the warlords. But now its just another knockoff empire. 

There are so many ideas in this book that I think could have worked well. Espically if they paired it with what we got or the parts of legacy they used anyways. 

I know a lot of people hate this series (either having really read it and disliked it or just because its a meme at this point) but I think those who haven't read it for theirself should give it a shot. ",StarWars,True,1529714656,2018-06-22
The Star Wars Cinematic Universe needs to find it's footing,"Disney has advertised that Star Wars will become the next major cinematic universe, but the way they're doing it is very...weird. The biggest problem is that there's no buildup, and that they haven't moved past the Skywalker saga yet.


Obviously this isn't the MCU, they can't build characters and have them team up for a final fight. It's more like if the Avengers were introduced in Avengers 1 and they fought Loki &amp; the Chitauri for 3 movies. Which is fine, I guess, but there needs to be an overarching story. 


So far, we have the ST, Rogue One &amp; Solo. The ST is the only thing with a continuing story, and even then, it's not building to anything. And RO/Solo are just backstory.


*And that's the strangest part.* Because they can't get away from the Skywalker saga. RO was cool, but it didn't tell us anything important. Same with Solo. Cool, we know more about how these movies stories started, but it's like if Marvel made a movie showing how Tony Stark made his fortune before becoming Iron Man. It fleshes out the story, but it's kind of a waste and doesn't improve a ""cinematic universe"".


Prequels are fine, if they're meaningful. If they go an make an Old Republic series, I'm all for that because it gives the backstory of the universe. But then there's the potential that RJ's trilogy will just be ""the sith are returning to the galaxy"". It's not an advancement of anything in the universe, **especially since we haven't seen any technological or world building differences throughout all 3 trilogies so far.** That's important to me as far as the advancement thing goes. I want to see a true threat, and I want to see a different galaxy than the Skywalker saga. 


**How I think it should go**: Does anyone care about my opinion? No, but I've ranted for this long, I might as well say how I would do it. 


One trilogy should go to different eras (Old Republic, Founding of the Jedi Order, etc.), while one should be advancing the overarching plot of the Star Wars Universe. 


While the first trilogy doesn't advance a CU narrative, it's a breath of fresh air and builds the backstory. SW right now is kind of like if the MCU started with Avengers: Infinity War and continued. Sure, it's a continuing universe, but it started in the middle of that universe. That's how the PT is. 


The second trilogy builds. It builds off the Skywalker saga to continue galactic threats without the Skywalkers. I think RJ should do his story like 100 years after the ST, and it should be a Yuuzhon Vong style story. A dark story about an invading race as the galaxy (and the new Jedi order) scrambles to protect itself. Then the next trilogy could be about a new Sith order that connects to that now defeated alien race (like worshipping or adapting their tech for the Dark Side use). The new Jedi order is like the Avengers. People come and go, sometimes the entire team gets changed around as the story continues, etc. 


And while this story is continuing, you still have the trilogies set in the past to flesh out the history of this universe and introduce new concepts for later use. 


So that's how I think it should go. Not a traditional cinematic universe since there would always be 2 stories, and the future story builds off events instead of characters, but it needs to find it's footing and overall just a format other than ""here's the backstory of ___"".",StarWars,True,1529716024,2018-06-22

A former Jedi pi trying to hide his powers and still help would be interesting.

 2. Zayne Carrick. JJM has talked about wanting to bring Zayne back to Canon and that it would probably be in the PT era since the OR is off limits. Zaynes original arc was being chased by a hidden group of Jedi seeres who killed their padawans and tried to kill him thinking one of them would be the next major sith Lord. Trade in the seers for inquisitors/ republic commandos and it could work. Also his gifts with the force are interesting to say the least and would be a fun story.

 3. Scout. Scout is in many ways the Batman of the order. She isn't the strongest in her class or has the best force connection so she works to get around that by mastering different marital arts, learning pressure points for a dozen and a half species, and trying new off the wall techniques like using the force to catch and deflect a saber with her hand. In Legends she was rescued by Clan Skirata and lived on mandalore. But her playstyle would be a lot like a force assisted Batman instead of full Jedi.

 4. Ferris Olin was Anakins rival between Tpm and AotC and left the order before AotC because of personal reasons. He would end up helping a proto Rebellion before his cell is destroyed and Obi-Wan sends him to Alderaan to look over Leia. His connection to Vader would be interesting.

 5. The Apprentice we met in the Vader comic who after escaping Mon calla is now trying to find Quinlin Vos, obi wan, Ahsoka or anyone.

Controversial idea for a Boba Fett movie,"To start, this is really dumb and there’s about a 0% chance of this happening, but please bear with me. 

What do we know about Boba Fett? He’s kind of mysterious, and very cool looking. Other characters seem to be afraid of him. Oh, and he’s “killed” by a blind man for a burp joke. My friend and I were discussing what a movie about him should even be, and how any Boba Fett story could be satisfying, knowing how he goes out. True, he could survive, but it would change the ridiculousness of what happened. So, with all that in mind, here’s the idea:

Boba Fett is a colossal screw up. Imagine it, he’s in the Sarlacc thinking he’s gonna die and so he confesses his life story to someone else. Basically, he’s been failing upward his entire life. We see him consistently fumble every bounty he tries to collect, only to succeed by sheer luck. People fear and respect him because he’s quiet and has intimidating armor, but he’s only quiet because he generally doesn’t know what’s going on and doesn’t want to sound stupid. Part of this involves him being the only bounty hunter to stay behind and follow the Millennium Falcon in ESB. That’s just because his ship broke down and all the other bounty hunters left without him. Again, by sheer luck, he gets it up and running, just as the Falcon reveals itself, so he follows it and gets Han.  Not only that, he loses the frozen Han a few times before finally getting him to Jabba’s palace. The big frozen Han block becomes a thing that keeps changing hands until Boba finally gets it back by accident. 

Then at the end of the movie, always by luck, he does something stupid with his jet pack (again, by mistake) that makes the sarlacc vomit him into the sky and he survives. Not because he’s a badass, because he’s still failing up. 

Basically, this is the Mr. Bean of Star Wars. ",StarWars,True,1529726800,2018-06-23
Another TLJ text post,"I don't want to rehash points too much. I have some critiques of TLJ, but mostly I loved it all over. I loved most of the characters, don't seem to have the ""plot hole"" issues most people have about Holdo, I think grumpy hermit Luke was the exact right choice, Space Leia didn't even particularly bother me. 

All that said, I didn't grow up with star wars the way some people have so maybe that's part of it. Thing is, I really don't get why people hate it so much. I don't have any issue with people not liking it, I really don't, but I sincerely don't understand. 

I have heard arguments and logical points. That's its own thing, and they help me understand why people don't like it, but why do people HATE it so much? I've seen people seem genuinely hurt by this movie, a lot of ""I've been a star wars fan my whole life, but I don't care anymore"" and the like. Where does that come from? I guess beyond logical criticisms of the movie, I'm curious what the emotional core of people's distaste is.",StarWars,True,1529727636,2018-06-23

"As a TLJ Fan, I do Have One Big Problem With The Film","As title says, I’m actually a big TLJ fan but there is something that really bothers me. Luke died too early for me.

Let me explain that I don’t mind Luke failing with Ben. Failure leads to more character growth. But the choice for Luke to die was a mistake chiefly because we will never see Luke create a successful and long lasting Jedi Order. Luke was the one who was supposed to do that. 

Now it’s obviously going to be Rey who gets to do that. I also like Rey just fine, but it should have been been Luke and Rey together. Luke will still have a major part to play in IX as a Force ghost but he shouldn’t have become a Force ghost until the end of IX. 

The biggest mistake made was that Luke doesn’t set up a long lasting new Jedi Order and that sucks. I still enjoy the sequels and think they are fun, but this will always bother me. I really hope that Luke as a Force ghost is heavily involved with Rey in recreating the Jedi Order.",StarWars,True,1529735527,2018-06-23
"Lucasfilm ""Licking Their Wounds"" But Not Halting 'Star Wars' Development","From https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-licking-wounds-but-not-halting-star-wars-development-1122655


The box-office returns of 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' are a wake-up call for the studio to make and market upcoming films differently, sources say.

Disney and Lucasfilm are reassessing their plans for future Star Wars movies in the wake of the disappointing performance of Solo: A Star Wars Story, which is having to fight to make much more than $350 million worldwide, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. 

""They haven’t slowed down development,"" says a source with knowledge of Lucasfilm’s thinking, ""but they are licking their wounds.""

Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and her team are regrouping and figuring out the direction of the movies beyond the final installment of the main series of films, Star Wars: Episode IX, which is scheduled for release Dec. 20, 2019. 

""It doesn’t mean those spinoffs don't happen,"" says another insider of Solo's underperformance globally. ""It just means they’re trying to figure out how to make, and market, them differently.""

In the case of the Boba Fett spinoff, the project is still being developed, sources tell THR, with Simon Kinberg and James Mangold writing the script with the plan being for Mangold to direct. (The filmmaker is prepping to next shoot his period racing drama Ford vs. Ferrari.)

But there's a catch with Boba Fett. Sources say that after the underperformance of Solo, the project could now be reconfigured. The thinking is that if Han Solo, one of the most iconic characters in the Star Wars universe, couldn’t sustain a big-budget origin feature, then any Fett movie would have to be scaled down, since though the character is popular, he’s certainly less well-known to most moviegoers than the Corellian smuggler.

The status of the Obi-Wan Kenobi spinoff is even less clear. Stephen Daldry had been in negotiations to direct, but both the studio and his agency, CAA, had no comment on the current state of the project. 

There had been rumors that Ewan McGregor, who played a younger Obi Wan in the first three episodes of the saga, would reprise his role for that spinoff — the actor was even present at the Solo premiere — but for his next gig, McGregor will shoot Warner Bros.’ adaptation of Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep, which goes into production later this year.

Since acquiring Lucasfilm for $4 billion in October 2012, Disney has released four films in the rejuvenated space opera franchise, the first three of which grossed between $1 billion and $2 billion. Solo, meanwhile, has grossed $344 million globally nearly a month after its worldwide release. 

""They were developing anything and everything,"" says another exec. ""It was a case of them stuffing so much sausage and not try to break the casing.""

Certainly, hopes for a Solo sequel have been dashed, and any ideas of exploring the subsection that fans call the ""Star WarsUnderworld"" may also be dashed, even if only temporarily. Solo teed up opportunities for characters such as Lando Calrissian and Darth Maul, who both appeared in the film, to become central characters in sequels or spinoffs.

Meanwhile, a June 20 story by Collider kicked off an online frenzy for its claim that Star Warsspinoff movies were being put on hold, though the site noted the situation was fluid. 

Right now, the development of new Star Warsmovies has gone underground. Two official film projects remain works in progress. Game of Thrones TV show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are writing and will produce a new series of movies, while Rian Johnson, who co-wrote and directed The Last Jedi, is developing a separate trilogy of his own. (The live-action Star Wars TV show that Jon Favreau is executive producing and that will air on Disney’s streaming service is also proceeding apace.)

But beyond Episode IX, no release dates have been announce for future films, a move out of step with current trends as studios, Disney included, plant flags for franchise releases years in advance.

""In light of the reaction to Last Jedi and the performance of Solo, they are now just going to look at what’s coming in and seeing how good it is, before dating anything,"" says one insider. ""It’s all pretty understandable.""

"[Discussion/Long Post] TLJ, Solo, Backslash, Future and my thoughts after 6 months","Hey everyone! Well, it’s been six months since The Last Jedi and after the release of the movie, pretty much everything has changed in the SW Universe. The community/fan-base seems more divided than ever and after the Solo total box-office disaster no one is sure about the future of the saga and spin-offs past Ep. IX. With this post, my goal is to discuss what caused the division, the brigades, the endless hate (and love) for TLJ, gather both objective and subjective (and even annedoctal) data, understand what people form the groups of lovers, haters, neutrals and try to project a better future for SW, after reaching certain key understandings about everything that happened so far.
A disclosure: I’m not going to pretend I’m “unbiased” towards TLJ and The Sequels: I love them with my whole heart. However, I’m aware that this is not the case for a significant (maybe even the majority) part of the community and I try to understand and recognise TLJ flaws, misconceptions, frustrated expectations and problems. The goal is to foment (healthy and constructive) debate, not write a love or hate letter to RJ, KK and their crew. So, here we go:

Objective Data
- TLJ made $1,4B dollars globally vs $2,06B from TFA
- Professional Critics’ Score is 89% on RT
- Audience score is 46% on RT
- IMDB’s rating is 7,3/10 (about 3,5 stars/five)
- Cinemascore rating for the movie was A

Surely there are plenty of other metrics (both favourable or against TLJ) available, but in pretty much every discussion here, on YT, social media etc., the key data mentioned is from the sources above. And from all of those, my feeling is that IMDB represents the general feeling towards the movie. It’s not excessively positive (like an 8+ rating) nor negative (as RT audience scores suggest). It’s also as prone to positive and especially negative brigading as RT but seems to be less of a niche website for movie ratings and information. It also is still updated daily and shows a definitely divise reception, being mostly positive.
One of the biggest discussion points of TLJ is if the movie was more loved or hated and often people provide their anecdoctal data to prove “how the movie sucked, bc 17 people irl I know hated it”. For exposition purpose, my own anedoctal data shows: 10 people liked the movie, 8 people didn’t, from my own 18 people who watched it (myself included). Amongst both groups there are hardcore fans, people who follow the SW Universe not so closely and general movie goers. Also, on both groups there are people who watched the movie multiple times, as well as those who had just left the screenings. And even amongst those smaller groups there are older and younger hardcore fans.
My point here is: while anecdoctal evidences may give us some sort of insight on the general movie reception, the more objective and accessible data sources seem to prove that:
1. YES, the movie was DIVISIVE
2. It SEEMS to have received a more positive reaction when we account the TOTALITY of moviegoers (critics hardcore fans, followers and general audience)
3. We have to check more niche sources to understand how people more invested in SW reacted to the movie

Solo Data

Everyone here is full aware of the box-office disaster that is Solo (which I also liked, not as much as R1 and the Sequels). While we still don’t have the final numbers, the best case scenario (unlikely) is that the movie brakes even. More realistically, it is probably losing money. And of course there are numerous factors for this but one key observation I make is: if TLJ was an absolute success amongst hardcore fans and “followers” of SW, it’s box-office should have been significantly better, following the established path of Marvel movies, being carried by those people. This is because the big appeal of a Solo movie without Harrison Ford is, pretty much, those fans, who would watch any SW movie, specially one which the main attribution is to expand lore of a key character - but whithout rellying on the character itself, since I believe Ford IS Han Solo, despite Aldeen’s great work. But as we all know, this wasn’t the case, as even the hardcore fandom won’t watch the movie.
Because of this, I’m willing to accept that maybe the MAJORITY of the hardcore fanbase DIDN’T like TLJ, or was put off by it. And this is accurate to a lot of the aspects that are going to be analysed regarding the movie’s reception.

Backslash

We all know the backslash TLJ received was (and still is) absurdly huge. While there are other factors to account (like people tending to post/comment negative reviews/analysis/commentary about any experience - whether it’s concerts, products, travels, purchases etc.), it’s easy to say that plenty of people didn’t like the decisions on TLJ. And, of course, inside that group there are the most (known) toxic portion of the fanbase. The same that drove George Lucas away from SW, bullied Jake Lloyd to infinity, hated the Prequels more than possible and now is making new “victims”, like RJ, Daisy Ridley and Kelly M. Tran. In my OPINION/Anedoctal observation, I would say that these represent 5-10% of the total fanbase. But, as stated by numerous people from media, critics and general audience, these people tend to invest a very significant amount of time to spread their “message” (i.e. pure hate - check SJN video about Kelly for reference). These are the type of people that write death threats to RJ, KK etc. daily, tend to be extremists and, from my point of view - ARE EVIL (jk) - should be completely disregarded in this specific discussion.
However, Lucasfilm and Disney’s job is to actually account for those people’s opinion and deal with it the best way they can think, in order to achieve their goals. Considering the idea is to tone down those people and isolate them from the rest of the influenceable G.A. sphere, it’s clear that their efforts are, at least, insufficient, or even plain and simply bad. In their public responses to those groups, KK, JJ and LF have mixed (large, significant) with them other groups with valid criticism and disatisfaction with the current state of the franchise, which simply increased the backslash.
Now, my goal here is to actually measure and understand the frustration of the large portion of the fanbase with valid criticisms, trying to counter when possible and acknoledge what must be changed. Here’s what I think about it:

Expectations vs Reality

For me, the greatest “issue” with the ST so far is the huge difference between what most hardcore fans expected and what they’ve received so far. While for me the general purpose of the Sequels was always clear, I feel that this wasn’t the case for most of those people, and thus caused the huge problems we face right now. For instance, I think the objective of 7, 8 and 9 was to EXPAND the lore by FINISHING the Skywalker Saga with NEW characters, while providing closure for the beloved original trio. However, and specially after Han’s death on TFA, it was explicitly clear that him, Leia and Luke would be gone after 9, passing the torch to the new generation of Rey, Kylo and Finn. While I never really expected any of the original heroes to be the main characters of the new saga and only fulfil the role of mentors and side-characters - as they have so far - it’s crystal clear that this WASN’T the perception nor the expectations of the majority of hardcore fans. And this happens for all sorts of reasons.
TFA, for example, tries to make clear that Luke won’t be there and that Rey is going to be the main new character, having a Skywalker (Ben/Kylo) as her counterpart. But during it’s execution, this messed got clouded by more interesting aspects of the sequel, like the Legacy of Leia and Han, Luke’s whereabout and the introduction of an apparent major villain (Snoke). And since those characters had 1) more recognition and love, 2) years of stories told in form of the EU, 3) more fleshed out and even more likeable personalities, traits and skills and 3) more appealing design (specially with Snoke), the goals of TFA start to fall flat. And by the (great) cliffhanger of the movie ending, those expectations could’ve got extremely confused, mixed.
(This might also explain, for example, the backslash on the Canto Bight side-saga of TLJ. It featured less interesting characters in an unknown planet. When you compare with Empire, for example, it gets as simple as Leia + Han &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Finn + Rose (and I really love the last two).

After TFA, for years the influencers of Star Wars generated theories, content, expectations and excitement on the subjects of their own attention: the original heroes left + Snoke. Even Snoke’s design allude to older, interesting and beloved characters, like Darth Plaeguis and this led to an extreme attatchment to a group of ideas. But with TLJ, the goal seemed to be enfatize the “torch pass” for the new generation, by literally killing the older one - while also tremendously expanding their legacy, specially with Luke. The result could be no other than failure and rage:
- Fans wanted to see Luke’s (and Leia/Han’s) legacy for 30 years with actual phenomenal special effects and structure only available in today’s movies
- TFA reinforced those feelings and expectations by delivering a confuse message
- RJ’s story WAS controversial even without this scenario (specially regarding the most beloved character of the saga). And also was trapped in JJ’s mistery boxes*
- TLJ delivered, on many occasions, the OPPOSITE of everything that was expected and (wrongly) built (specially after TFA).

*My best example is Luke being away. If, for instance, Luke was still connected to the Force and was seeking for a way to defeat Snoke on the First Jedi Temple (like I’ve seen in numerous suggestions for TLJ), this could cause even bigger backslash: because, in that case, he would be 100% feeling the death of his rebellion, friends and family and would’ve literally done nothing to help them, even while being on this quest for a salvation. While I believe those ideas were serviceable and workable, I’m also sure that this would be pointed ALL THE TIME by detractors as a clear “mis-characterisation of Luke” and “childhood-destroying ideas, like, HOW WOULD LUKE LET THEIR FRIENDS DIE?!”. But keep in mind, there was pretty much no way RJ could undo this, so, he was clearly in the worst position possible in the begining of TLJ. But I do agree that he handled things poorly in some occasions: I 100% disagree with Luke simply throwing away his father’s saber, which could be done in so many different ways while still passing the same message - like, say, simply dropping it into the ground and leaving.

Well, overall, the Expectations vs Reality theme is omnipresent in TLJ, many times in extremely controversial and unchangeable decisions: Luke cut himself from Force for believing his presence in the whole war scenario was disturbing it - specially after considering murdering his nephew and effectively creating Kylo Ren; Snoke was killed for the sake of progressing Kylo’s story; Rey is the daughter of nobodies and the living manifestation of the light-side; the whole conflict is reset to the same point of A New Hope, maybe in an even smaller scale (for a galaxy-wide war) and Luke is gone (and also Leia). While I actually loved most of these elements, decisions and agree with their execution, it’s 100% clear that MANY would disagree - even Mark Hamill himself, for example. And specially with all the elements regarding Leia and, mainly, Luke.
The change on his personality, his failled legacy, his new beliefs and posture, it was A LOT to process. And for people who spent 30y theorizing about it, it really must’ve been hard to see their most beloved hero being completely deconstructed. And in the end, even with him performing the alleged strongest use of the Force in Canon, he did it by sacrificing himself for an “uncertain” future and in a peacefull way - not fulfilling even the Lightsaber wet-dreams of a significant part of the fanbase. Once again: I really LOVED all of this, thought that it expanded Luke like nothing could, make me like and care with the character MUCH more and - being a pacifist myself - fulfilled what I didn’t even imagine I wanted. But, of course, I can see that this wouldn’t be the case for many - even most - of the fanbase. When you do this while also killing Snoke, not having Leia available for what would be “her” movie (in a Mentor role), the controversy was all set. But do I think this is a writing mistake on RJ’s? No!

The thing is: for me it was clear that those 3 movies wouldn’t focus on the original cast at all. They wouldn’t protagonize the main scenes, they wouldn’t have the main roles, they wouldn’t have most actions scenes (if any), simply because - and I don’t know why - it was ALWAYS clear that this would be REY’s, KYLO’s and FINN’s story. And then, I even got to love even more the orignial heores, cry their deaths, be amazed at their accomplishments - even in a movie which the central theme was “faillure” - and, overall, find new elements on their characters that I simply didn’t imagine. But now, when youtubers were expecting Luke to fight Snoke, cut his arm and save Rey and Leia from his soul-force-sucking-abilities, we can really see what went wrong.
And by no means I’m saying they were wrong in have those expectations! In fact, it was those specullations and leak videos that got me REALLY interested in TLJ in the first place. But of course, I also had what would be the “ideal” mindset for watching TLJ: expecting a story focused on new characters and “get” awesome moments like Leia and Luke’s reunion, or his showdown on Crait.

For me it’s just a problem of expectations vs reality, in the end.

What to do/think for now on?

I think the key aspect for this trilogy to end well is: make a clear statement of what it’s trying to do and whose story is this. But also, fulfill SOME of the fanbase desires. I mean, having Luke present is A MUST, and having him having a really important role as a mentor but decisive in the war - specially with good actions scenes and good thought-full moments like his Yoda reunion - could really improve the scenario for IX. Also, have a PR work that can actually communicate with those who felt “betrayed” and are now not really invested into it. Understand their demands and, when possible, do what they want, while also telling the story that LF/JJ/KK wanted to tell in the first place. And, of course, separate people with vallid criticisms from the 5-10% of pure haters because it’s very clear which group should be heard.

And well, I’m hear to read opinions, thoughts and discuss. I want SW to become HUGE, like it was. And with the new fanbase in formation (specially kids growing up with these movies) and the original hardcore lovers, it definitely CAN.

Why I think the yoda scene in tlj is genius,"Idk if this is spoiler territory or something but I'm just gonna go in assuming you've all seen it. Tlj to me seems like a point in star wars that kinda just steps outside of the repetitive nature of the series and analyzes it. This scene really embodies that for me. The whole film luke is going on and on about letting the jedi end. Its a part of his life that he wants to erase basically. He feels by burning it all, erasing the chance of another learning what he has and therefore experiencing what he has, he can move on. But theres yoda. And yoda doesn't tell him not to really, but he shows him why it doesn't matter. He burns down the tree (which didn't have the jedi texts in it anymore but really that doesn't matter) to show Luke that even disowning it, as in a part of your life, a part of who you are, you can't deny it is a part of you. Its better to accept that and become better than to try to destroy it completely. You could apply this to literally any choice you've ever made as a person, good or bad. It doesn't matter if you ignore it it's still there, move on but learn from it as well. I think that really can sum up star wars sure, but it really does seem to reach out to the viewer in a way and just says to accept life as it is and try your best to be a part of it. Yoda really embodies that state of mind, and I think most people should follow in that example.",StarWars,True,1529748609,2018-06-23

Action!!!,"Alright do you think we need that Prequels Action (Martial arts like Jedi combat) in the next Star Wars movies?

My Idea for a Fett Stand-alone,"
Like a good bit of fans, I’ve had mixed feelings when it comes to the standalone spinoffss. Sure, some of them are cool and add a few elements to the OT, but none of them have given much emotional depth or weight to any of the characters. For example, Solo is a movie which could have been a Casablanca-style exploration of a young Han’s romantic outlook being shattered by personal betrayal. Like Rick Blaine, Han in the OT is a character that reeks of world weary disdain that was probably acquired after getting burned one too many times. Like Bogart’s character, Han was a man who stuck his neck out for nobody  and was cynically detached from people. We could almost infer from his “I know” line that his detached attitude was just as much a way to sound cool while also protecting himself from getting hurt again. Instead, Solo was a simple movie about a cocky good hearted space cowboy who stays the same character all the way thru, despite being betrayed by his first love. Fans of the OT like myself want EMOTIONAL risk rather than physical risk. It’s far more important as a storyteller to risk a piece of the character’s heart than whether or not the character lives or dies at the end of the movie. You make good standalones by adding emotional layers to characters rather than explaining where they got their dl44 or vest or dice or whatever. And yes, I liked Rogue One but I still don’t think it mines the depths of Jyn’s character like it should. 

All of y’all probably know that a Boba Fett spin-off has been in the works recently. Admittedly, I’m not a huge boba fett fan just because I feel he’s a cool looking character without a lot of substance. He does add something to the OT though since his Clint Eastwood vibe fits in with the Space Western elements of the trilogy.  In the same way that Han Solo embodies certain qualities of the gunslinger, Boba fett embodies those same qualities albeit in a much more ruthless, unscrupulous way. The character, aside from a few poor attempts at fleshing out the character in the PT, is essentially the epitome of a character that looks cool, provides conflicts for the protagonists, and essentially functions as a set piece which adds to the atmosphere of the world. 
By this description, you would think that a Boba Fett movie would be the wrong character to kickstart a series of emotional, deeper standalones right? WRONG!Here’s my dream plot for a Fett movie. Disclaimer: it bears a resemblance in plot to Logan which bears a resemblance to Unforgiven which I’m sure bears a resemblance to other movies. There are no truly original stories and I’m sure you can see echoes of these stories in my plot. I do however think that this kind of film would fit. 
PLOT: 
The film would take place somewhere 3-5 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. Unlike every other Star Wars film ever, the film would take a risk by spending the majority of the time if not all of the time on the planet Tatooine.  

A planet which is in a state of rebuilding, particularly in the more exposed regions where the spaceports are, Tattooine is a planet with areas and villages still struggling to be touched by the influence of the New Republic. Despite the Empire’s defeat, violent sand people and gangs still have a firm grip on the planet’s villages despite the New Republic’s limited influence. The New Republic, still busy combatting the Imperial Remnant (as shown in BF2’s campaign,) has been unable to restore the planet completely. Many of the villagers in Tattooine remain feeling abandoned or without hope. Where they thought that the New Republic would not turn a blind eye to their poverty like the Republic before it, they feel as if the war has changed nothing for them. 

In the broken outskirts of Tattooine, a few days journey away from the slightly more polished Mos Eislsy spaceport, there lies a somewhat small village. This village remains somewhat untouched as the villagers work hard doing moisture farming. They a receive a monthly transmission from Mos Eisley that the Republic is sending relief portions to feed everyone.  For these villagers, it’s a horrible ordeal since the journey to Mos Eisley takes time even if they could risk journey on a precious landspeeser, and it’s always a risk because of sand people. When a group of villagers are randomly selected to make the 3 day journey to Mos Eisley, it’s generally understood to be a possible death march.

This village has little defense against sand people, save for a mysterious, gruff stranger who lives in a lone hut right beside the village. What the people do know is that the stranger serves as an excellent Everyman protector and frequently and easily fights off raiders in exchange for a generous amount of portions which he takes back to his hut every night. The stranger has burned, scarred armor covering torso and legs, and has an unkept beard and long hair. The stranger also sports a nasty burned patch on his face. 

What the villagers do not know is that this mysterious protector is a broken shell and shadow of the man who was the greatest bounty hunter the galaxy has ever known, Boba Fett.  Having barely  survived the ordeal of the sarlaac thanks to his durasteel armor, Fett escaped, literally burning his way out of the pit and escaping with acidic burns on his body and part of his face. 

Fett is no longer a legend, but lives in near isolation using his skills acquired as a hunter to make a living out of easily dispatching sand people. Frequently having nightmares of the Sarlaac and imagining sounds of a disappointed Jango, Boba is a man with the Star Wars equivalent of PTSD. He also frequents returning to the site of the pit, where he relives the end of his career over and over. 

Following a day of warding off a particularly vicious attack by sand people and saving a small group of people, Fett walks into the village to receive his fair share of portions from the village headmaster. When meeting the headmaster again, the headmaster mentions to Boba that he received a transmission from Mos Eisley. Fett, not caring, begins leaving with his portions before the man plays the transmission. The transmission is a holographic message from a saintly, older woman in white robes, clearly someone in charge of the Republic. She acknowledges the village by stating that she wants to have word with its everyman protector, the man who she believes to be Boba Fett. She explains that In Mos Eisley, villagers making the monthly portion run had seeded the rumors of their protector frequenting the apparent grave of the most ruthless bounty hunter of the galaxy and bearing burned but wearable green armor.  

Fett simply wants to be left alone to rot, but eventually ships from the Republic land and Fett walls aboard to have a conversation with his pursuer, a woman by the name of Mon Mothma. Mothma sits down with the grizzled, war torn Fett and asks him to do one last job. She explains that the criminal syndicates are still active despite Jabbas death. She reveals that many are in allegiance with the sand people and maintain Tattooine’s state as a ruined planet where the Republic cannot touch. The Hutt syndicate has been taken over by a new mysterious leader. Due to Fett’s past ties with the Hutt syndicate, he is seen as the perfect man for the job of finding this gangster/warlord since he perhaps knows the secrets and inner workings of the better than any man.  Fett reluctantly agrees to this one last job in exchange for credits and portions but does not know that it will be a journey in which he faces his past and rediscovers honor in pain. 
—————-
I think that this kind of story would be a perfect send off for the character. It would give the character a personality and give emotion. It would also turn the Sarlaac pit into a way to deepen the character. 

And so begins a dark, gritty film that the franchise needs. Who knows? Maybe Mangold will pull thru.

Rey's parents... been doing some thinking [Spoilers : The Last Jedi],"So for ages I though Rey was a Kenobi.  It just seemed to fit with her way of being, her accent, her actions.  Then we got (s/ Kylo's input on this question) in TLJ and I was kind of sad but understood why the story might go that way.  Today I was re-watching TLJ and suddenly thought Rey might be **Qui Gon's grand daughter** (or other relation).  It would be fantastic.  He was such a wise unconventional Jedi, it would be brilliant if a relative of his became the founder of the new Jedi!

What are you excited about for episode 9 and/or the future of the Star Wars franchise?,"I'll start by saying I haven't been crazy about Disney's Star Wars movies. I didn't like TFA or TLJ, but Rogue One was enjoyable. I didn't see Solo- I didn't boycott it, I just wasn't interested. 
When I discussed it on this sub, found a lot of people feeling how I felt about the future of Star Wars- apathetic. 

I don't want to start a TLJ discussion, but I feel the movie sucked all narrative tension from the story. The way I see it- the saga can go one of two ways in regards to it's A/B plots. Rey can redeem Kylo, or defeat him. Both options are boring to me. I've already seen a dark, tortured former Jedi get redeemed by the plucky young sand orphan. If she defeats him, I don't care because she has already defeated him twice- there is no tension there. 

Same issue with the B plot and the rebels. They can defeat the empire (which we've seen before) or the empire survives (which I think is more likely so they can keep making stormtrooper toys). This just doesn't interest me.

Then there's the issue of the future films. With the news that the anthology films are on hold (hopefully for quality control), I'm slightly optimistic.  However, I don't care about anything else planned. I don't enjoy Ryan Johnson's work (from the 3 films I've seen) and I don't want to see a presumably dark and gritty take from the GoT guys. The TV series from  Jon Farvrau might be good as I've enjoyed his work, but I'm still reserved. 

Overall, I am not interested in Disney's apparent goal of using Star Wars as a Marvle-style, two movie a year nostalgia cash cow.  I'm not mad, I'm disinterested. 

But that said, I'm obviously pretty cynical. What makes you excited and why am I wrong? ",StarWars,True,1529780135,2018-06-23

"Fans have no place dictating creative decisions. Multiple franchises are being watered down by the fans and execs.(Star Wars, Mass effect, halo)","Let me preface this by saying how I really liked rogue one and solo. I also appreciate what rian johnson was trying to do with TlJ. I am glad risks were taken.

I am a huge critic of disney and how they played it safe with rogue one. It represents how they only care about money sometimes. However, after seeing tlj and solo I saw that there are people like rian johnson and the cast/crew behind solo that have some artistic integrity.

I would like to see a creator have zero constraints from executives and executives that listen to the fans more than they should. Fanservice is important in starwars obviously but over using it leads to uninspired cash grabbing movies.

Fan interference in the creative process should never happen. The fans did not write Empire, fans of breaking bad did not write that show, fans did not write the best picture winning film at the oscars. 

We have this section of the fanbase that wants to retcon the last jedi. This will never happen but this backlash has already altered the future of the franchise. Rian Johnson being sidelined in favor of JJ. Fans boycotting Solo. The executives not properly advertising and releasing solo. 

This is happening in other franchises too. A small vocal part of the fanbase is altering mass effect and halo. They retconned the end of mass effect 3 because of fan ""outrage"". In halo they are watering down the story and visuals for a small group of militant purists. These things set a bad precedent. Vocal fans are altering the creative fabric of franchises. When this happens the franchise is just there for cashflow and there is no artistry involved in the writing process.

Halo is a perfect example...



343 caved to the vocal minority of fans and scrapped the amazing visuals and style from halo 4 and 5. Instead of having a mix of classic designs and new like starwars is doing with recent movies they are just stripping their gorgeous designs from canon. Just look at the vibrant art below. They are also talking about have a ""simple Story"" for the next halo which is the opposite of they should do. Just like disney execs they are pandering to the average dumb consumer that can't handle a more original story. This happened with bungie between halo 2 and 3 where they sidelined arbiter(thel vadamee) because of angry fans that didn't want a multi dimensional story.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEm21t7fRAg](this video documentary represents how much care they put in to John 117's character evolution and how it is reflected in his armor.) In the new halo they are just reverting back to the old halo 3 armor for nostalgia. It appears there is a time skip so they essentially are leaving halo 5 on a cliff hanger and will give us no explanation for this change. Like I stated before, they are watering down the [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/5vs78u/bonnie_ross_we_want_to_tell_a_more_simple_story/). We saw this in halo wars 2 where the story is almost childlike and dumbed down. 

[Compare the visuals above to this bland nature film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkEFQ_Q2kKw). This is a direct result of fan meddling. There is no strict definition of what halo should look like but some fans want a monolithic and boring visual style.

Halo 4 and 5 still look generally like halo with subtle changes. Just like the first order and the clones look like storm troopers but they have their own unique features.


When I watch star wars I like to see the variety they have in the different planets and species. Solo takes this even further. It is visually similar to what I imagine 1313 would have been.

Anyone else feel that Palpatine in ROTJ (specifically) is still the most menacing villain in Star Wars?,"This isn't even meant to be at the expense of any of the other films, but, rewatching the Throne Room scene yesterday, Palpatine honestly comes out as the best villain in the entire series, or at least most menacing. Rewatching the scene, Palpatine's entire plan was to just sit there and talk to Luke until he snapped and turned to the darkside. And it nearly worked too. In context, Luke went in knowing the Emperor was the galaxy's greatest monster and still nearly turned because Sidious really is *that* charismatic. In fact, Sidious is so confident he can break Luke by simply having a single conversation with him that the very first thing he does is remove his braces and tell his guards to go away. Finally, in the actual scene, he basically just outlines to Luke that the Rebellion is fucked and he can't do anything about it because Palpatine (who's ""unarmed"", making it wrong for Luke to attack) won't let him leave. And that nearly turns Luke into his apprentice. ROTJ honestly did have one of the best finales, far as the Skywalker Saga goes, IMO.",StarWars,True,1529793039,2018-06-23

The Last Jedi Blu Ray Week 2 Sales Dropped 75%,"Following up on the thread about The Last Jedi's Launch week Blu Ray sales, numbers for week 2 have released and reveal a 75% drop in purchases. Despite The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi launching in the box office to near identical numbers, The Last Jedi BluRay launched to half of The Force Awakens Blu-ray sales.

These numbers mean that The Last Jedi's Blu Ray two weeks combined sales failed to match The Force Awakens' launch week haul. Should this trend play out over the next couple of weeks, The Last Jedi may not have made in one month what The Force Awakens made in one week. This would indicate that for home sales, in contrast to the box office, The Last Jedi is appearing to have performed exponentially worse than The Force Awakens, not simply at a 50% loss. Some have complained in the past that digital sales maybe lowering the sales for The Last Jedi, however a 75% drop from Week 1 to Week 2 is overwhelmingly indicative of a lower performing, front-loaded home release.

Could a nebula have improved certain TLJ plot holes?,"I was thinking about how the space chase plot could have worked without ""breaking"" the established physics of Star Wars, such as they are.

I got to thinking: if the whole segment had taken place in some nebula-like phenomenon, could the chase have worked?

If the nebula was explained to be ""dense"" enough, you'd have a reason for constant thrust being needed to maintain speed. Also, the vast surface area of Supremacy would help hand wave why it was slower. 

Ships losing thrust would therefore pull back. Obviously it's still exaggerating the effect greatly, but it would have a basis in basic mechanics.

Additionally, the ""nebula"" could interfere with hyperdrive sensors, preventing any First Order ship just jumping to flank the Resistance. You'd still be able to to a ""blind"" jump, such that *that* scene still works. Leia's beacon thing could allow Rey to get there, and for Flynn and Rose to get back from there side quest (one plot issue at a time).

Also the idea of the Resistance heading to a planet hidden in a nebula to hide would be fairly dramatic. Also, a nebula would look pretty cool.

""The Great Tide""

synopsis

Its few years after The last Jedi.

General Leia Organa  passed away .First Order is reigning with the iron fist.However many worlds are opposing its rule.First order has managed to subdue much of the galaxy due to its enormous and unexplained military resources.Rebellion has grown in strength to a level from before TFA, however they have no ways to oppose First Order.Kylo Ren rules benevolently, leaving military operations in the hands of First Order's High Command led by Hux.Kylo is obsessed with Rey,he sees her as a treat and plans to reach to her trough Force connection. Rey feels his attempts but holds him off.

First order is searching for Force sensitive individuals across the galaxy bay the secret order of former Supreme Leader Snoke,order that is still active,  some of them found refuge in the rebellion.

In the moment of despair Rebells get information which confirms their suspicion that the explanation for the First Order's near limitless resources is beyond known Galaxy Rose and Finn with the team of people and droids get assignment to investigate.

At the end of funeral ceremony for Leia , desperate Rey which is struggling against fears and confusion about her role in all of it, feels the call in the Force to return to Ahch\-To.

In the meantime Rebellion led by Poe Dameron continues its partisan actions against the First Order.There is swift diversion of a major shipyard.Rebels have no permanent planetary base however and rely on small groups or cells.

 Rey, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3Po board Millennium Falcon (including Porgs).Rey revisits Ahch\-To and founds Star Compass owned by Luke, which was keep safe by Caretakers.Using the ancient Jedi text as as source of coordinates, which she imputs in ancient Star compass ,Rey gets location of the forgotten planet on the far outer edge of the galaxy,which moves over time relative to the rest of galaxy and is difficult to be pinpointed, thus has been almost forgotten.

Hux is trying to get on power with the help of part of the First Order high command and industrials which considers Kylo Ren as an usurper devoted to ancient religion.Poe and Rose fly to Batuu where their link (later revealed was send by Hux) to First Order's secret is.A blue skinned woman alien (Chiss race ) is kept as prisonner.She sacaped from secret facility.

Rey , Chewy, R2D2 and C3Po arrive on the unknown planet located by Rey.Its an ocean planet ,covered almost entirely by oceans except few islands.They land on the largest island that is just some dosen kilometers wide, with palms, white sand beaches and enormous structures made from rocks weighting thousands of tons arranged like enormous domino blocks scattered around and one on top of the other.The island is abandoned, Rey founds only old traces of primitive almost stone age  activity.And a massive Force tree in the shadow fo rock mensa, Uneti tree bigger than on  Ahch\-To.Suddenly a 2 magnificent avian creatures arrive from the sky.They sport wingspan of over 20 meters, with four X shaped  wings,which they can foil back as an arrow and dive like jets towards Rey.Animals are evolution product that looks like combination of bird, Orca and dinosaur and are magnificat ,intelligent and beautiful. Scared Rey almost runs from gigantic creaturs as they dive fast towards her at first conact, jet they birds extend their wings in a last moment, fly over Rey  and start birds cry from excitement . The birds are domesticated , Rey finds saddle on the one of it .Birds are wounded, have many scars, struggling to survive.The haven't seen their masters for long time.

In the meantime Finn and Rose release prisoner and she leads them to the planet where First Order has secret production facility.

Kylo Ren makes trap for a Hux and his allies , he senses trason and lures them in the conference room, shuts the door and kills them all with his Ligh saber.He kills Hux the last while he beggs for his life.Kylo has found the conspiracy against peace and prosperity that leads to technocracy, industrials and rich people who mostly gather  on Canto Bight,they generate profits by maintaining constant war ,thus they also finance the rebels as well as First Order, as the peace in the galaxy is not in their interest. Kylo Ren wanst to bring peace. He orders his forces to ocuppy Canto Bight and other places and destroy conspirators.Kylo actually purges the expropriators, the filth of the galaxy.

The storm begins on a ocean planet. Suddenly a First Order fighters arrive above island , they destroy Millennium Facon that was on the ground.First Order fighters consider mission acomplished, an intruders as eliminated.Rey, droids and Chewbacca barely escape and hide in the Force tree. There Rey feels the call from the  Force, and finds that within the tree there is entrance to the cave beneath the [island.In](https://island.In) the cave Rey finds tapestry of ancient cave paintings on the cave walls depicting various [events.Like](https://events.Like) a stone age cave paintings. Above every painting on the cave wall there is a color  imprint of a hand of the author .When she touches the painted hands a Force visions almost like a hologram fills the cave.

Rey follows story of the paintings which fill the cave like holograms: Human race originates from a planets that no longer exist.Thousands of generations  ago those people were the first sentient beings that mastered knowledge about the Tide, which is the Force.They were the brightest beings in the galaxy for  millennia and galaxy have prospered, it was the first Galactic civilization.Their technology was far above the technology level of galaxy to date.They mastered Force and technology for prosperity.

Than a schism happened ,and catastrophic war, because some believed they can use the Force for their cause, and thus created Dark Side sect and as a result Light Force sect emerged to oppose it.The ancient war of epic proportions happened ,which devastated the [galaxy.As](https://galaxy.As) a result of fiersome war the planets that were once the core of this civilization were completly obliterated, a thousand star systems [vanished.As](https://vanished.As) a result of this war at the place of blodiest battles a barrier formed in the center of the galaxy, comprised of black holes, space storms and other weird anomalies, known today as a barrier that prevents safe communication between the two parts of the galaxy. Some survivors from this bloody war, a crew on an enormous dome\-shaped space station came to this ocean planet seeking refuge.They landed  the 100 kilometers spherical dome shaped space station touching down the floor of the depest ocean on this planet.They sweared never ever to use technology and their knowledge about the Force. They settled on the planet calling it Lew'el, meaning Deluge, also a Lukewarm God, and lived for thousand of generations without any technology, eating from the sea, using domesticated avian creatures for travel and hunt.They we all Force sensitive. Their shamans ,however, preserved precious original knowledge about the Force.

Finally on the wall Rey founds a recent picture of an X\-wing and a person. Rey touches hand imprint above it and last story unfolds. Decades ago Luke Skywalker has visited this planet, and saved young girl form certain death in the storm.Many years later he revisited the planet when she was now a grown woman. In this moment Rey realizes this is actually another Force cave as it reacts on her's Force presence.

Rey watches the girl saved by Luke becomes a woman, as she walks from one side of the cave and stands in the center.From the other side of the cave she sees Darth Vader, and near him Luke Skywalker as he looked in Empire Strikes back.vader and Luke walk towards the woman.Vader than turns in to Jedi Anakin . Than Anakin positions behind  Luke and dissappears , and Luke turns in to Luke from the Return of the Jedi. Luke approaches woman and they look each other affectionately, they are in love.Luke calls her name, Aya.

Rey is confused jet something inside her is moving, she starts to realize the will of the Cosmic Force is behind it all an above all.Rey and  Chewy as well as droid's stay on the island for days.

Suddenly Finn and Rose arrive on that same planet.

This desolated planet with apparently no any technology is actually the same planet where First Order has its most significant production facility, most advanced in existance, an ancient Forge. Alien woman tells them story how the First Order came to this planet many years ago and occupied it, enslaving its small population and killing the rest.First order found greatest secret of the planet.A submerged many millennia old Forge, that is still operational. It harvests natural Force [sensitiviy.It](https://sensitiviy.It) operates by means of senient slave labor within it. Its a desecration of the Force.A Force sensitive slaves from all around the unknown regions have been brought in here to serve as slaves, to make the forge [operational.It](https://operational.It) produces endless amounts of weapons and military hardware,just as in ancient war that destroyed the galaxy. Finding the forge enabled First Orders rapid expansion beyond anyone's expectation and explains massive fleets that First Order possess .

During Rey's emotional event in the cave Kylo establishes connection and realises she is on the ocean planet that is known to him already very well.

Heroes decide to infiltrate the base and start the rebellion there. They use birds, wind thrusters,which First Order considers unimportant (except for hunting and sport).Rey uses instinct and mounts one bird, and they fly to the [sky.Team](https://sky.Team) follows.

In the meantime Kylo arrives on the planet, enters the base which uses whirlpool\-like entrance mechanism.

Kylo hears the voice of Luke Skywalker. Kylo Ren than remembers the past, that night when he mutinied against Luke he took some of his students who were already Dark sided acolytes, and slaughtered rest of Luke's pupils.Kylo has studied Lake's compass long before, and has found that Luke's knowledge originates from this planet.Emediately after Kylo and his Knights mutinied, they headed to this planet and found a village on an island.Those people refused to cooperate and Kylo and Knights wiped out the entire village. Luke skywalker came after trhem in his X\-wing.Luke was dark and powerful, angry,he single handedly killed all Knights of Ren except one last and Kylo, which both escaped.That surviving Knight of Ren is now commander of this base.

Kylo Ren remembers the moment when he spared life of a little 4 years girl in that village during slaughter. He never understood why he has done that.That moment hunted him for years, now more than ever, he can't accept why he did it.

Kylo is the one that revealed this ocean planet in the name of the First Order and has set in motion the future of the Galaxy, just as Luke did before.Kylo reported to Snoke what happened, and Snoke emediately understood the obscure ocean planet is the refuge planet with legendary lost Forge, and the people who keep original knowledge about the Force,ancestors of his oldest enemies.They will be enslaved and destroyed and Forge utilised.

Rey,Poe, and Rose infiltrate Forge .They start mutiny .Finn is severely wounded but Rose saves him and Poe Dameron comes in a critical moment and they escape. Slaves from many species ,  all of them Force sensitive  help mutiny and free themselves starting the fall of the First Order , destroying their captors.

Kylo Ren fights Rey within the wast space of the ancient station\-forge.The station is so big that under its translucent dome there is entire massive forest,which helps in maintaining stability of Force draining mechanism of the Forge.Within station, under theglass like dome there is a many kilometers wide forest of Wroshyr trees.Those are massive trees crteated by the orignal civilisation, and was a symbol of those people,  and their tool in Force techology.Those same trees were in ancient times planted on Kashyyk and other planets.Including Batuu.On Batuu those trees were burned and petriffied during the ancient war, thir petrified remnants are now the sharp rocks on that planet.

Kylo has the upper hand in the duel, he offers Rey the alliance last time, tells to Rey he made mistake for sparing her once, now he will [not.In](https://not.In) a duel of fates however Kylo gets  wound by Finn ho finds them and Shots Kylo, than Rey funishes him in last stand deffense  with the light saber trough his torso .In his last moments, Kylo begs Rey to forgive him, tells her the truth how he sensed she is the chosen,chosen over him, and tells her ""I'we seen your parents, Luke is your father, you are the chosen,  bring the balance ,bring the  peace."" Rey cries calling him  Ben, upon which Ben smiles to her ,and than he passes away. Rey takes his body and board a rescue ship together with Chewbacca and droids and goes back to Ahch\-To. In the meanitme more rebell shipps arrive taking liberated slaves from the Forge, but not after Rose activate ancient engines and sets Forge for self\-destruction.Forge lifts from the ocean, enters the Space above planet and than explodes and wanishes in a gravity well.

Moving upstairs at Ahch\-To ,in the night, Rey sees bluish apparition on the cliff in the distance.With the tears in her eyes as she approaches the apparition, which is Luke Skywalker's Force ghost .The visions of the past emanate from the surroundings trough the Force concluding the story:After the destruction of Jedi academy Kylo Ren and Knights of Ren slaughtered sacred village on Lew'el, but Kylo spared REy by the will of the Force. Her mother , Aya, died there . First Order than occupied the planet.She was alone for days,hungry and thirsty, in the shock she has made her past die.Luke who have seen slaughter, and after he destroyed Knights of Ren has gone mad. He thought he lost everything, his love, child,sacret village, and he was even forced to kill his own mutinied pupils. Luke has lost everything he had,he closed himself off from te Force, and  eventually crushed his X\-wing on Ahch\-to , going to exile,.But Luke has found the unbeliveble truth at the moment of his death.

Days after the tragedy,  Luke's old friend and traveler , believer in the Force , Lorr\-San Tekka , who has heard of calamity came to Lew'el, and took a little girl.He heard of the happenings, about First Order enslaving Force sensitive people, and thus he hide Rey from the sight of anyone in the desert of [Jakku.As](https://Jakku.As) a Force sensitive she worthed very much, thus he has given her to Unkar hiding her idenitity and force sensitivity perfectly.Lorr San Tekka still observed her and helped in many ways.

Rey is the ultimate tool of the will of the Force. She is a daughter of a woman which represented the  fathers of the galactic civilization and the  knowledge about  the Force, and a man that  represents final intervention of the Force trough the birth of Chosen One, Anakin, and his son .Rey is the fulfillment of the ultimate will of The Force to bring the balance,heal the wounds of the galaxy by uniting beginning and the end , old and new. Rey is the true Chosen one.She represents the history of the Galaxy and the will of the Force.

Rey looks at Luke,he looks et Rey.After emotional scene Rey burns the body of Ben Solo.The Force spirit of Luke Skywalker is joined by her mother Aya, Leia,Yoda, Obi\-Wan.Force spirit of Ben Solo joins [them.In](https://them.In) that moment Cosmic Force brings the immortal spirit of Han Solo to , for his contribution to the balance .

Rey looks in Force spirits around her, than turns her look in to a distance .Force spirits fade. Rey is willingly closing herself off from the Force, briging the balance, and handing over the future back to the Will of the Force.

Was there anything in The Force Awakens that indicated Poe as a “hot-headed” pilot?,"One thing I don’t understand about Poe’s arc in TLJ, is that it seems he goes from hot-headed pilot to someone who cares about the bigger picture. It’s very similar to Solo’s arc in the OT.

But what I don’t understand is why they turned Poe into a generic hot-headed pilot akin to Solo, when it didn’t really fit with his established character in TFA.

I’m TFA, Finn was a strong pilot, who cared deeply about the resistance and was very kind.  He was helpful and respectful to everyone he interacted with in the film(obviously not Kylo), and there was nothing that I can remember to indicated him as a kind of “hot-head, ignore the rules” type. I don’t like the decision to make his character that way in The Last Jedi. Him sacrificing his own bombers to take out the dreadnaught and then not showing any remorse at the others that died because he didn’t pull back seems to directly contradict the caring character we were shown in The Force awakens. 

What are your thoughts? It seemed to me like they had to change the character for the sake of the plot line they wanted to go for. ",StarWars,True,1528749331,2018-06-11
Obi-Wan and the Jedi Way,"Maybe I'm slow, but I just realized something about Obi-Wan in Revenge of the Sith. There were three instances where someone ""too dangerous to be kept alive"" was defeated and at the mercy of their opponent (well, one wasn't quite defeated maybe.)

Count Dooku vs Anakin. Anakin is encouraged by Palpatine to execute Dooku. Afterward, Anakin feels guilty for it because it's not the Jedi way.

Mace vs Palpatine. Whether or not Palpatine throws the duel is irrelevant here, the general idea is the same. Mace has a choice to make. And he chooses to execute Palpatine. Obviously this handily goes south (heh) because Anakin knows Mace is wrong to execute a defeated opponent who must stand trial instead. Again, it's not the Jedi way. 

Anakin vs Obi-Wan. Here, Anakin is pretty much dead. He's a monster, he's powerful, and he's at Obi-Wan's mercy. Instead, though, Obi-Wan bucks the trend and instead chooses to let Anakin die on his own. The fight is over. His enemy is defeated, and it's only a matter of time before he naturally succumbs to his wounds. Not to mention the pain in executing his own friend &amp; brother. What I find pretty cool here, is that one could think Obi-Wan should've executed Anakin. He didn't take vengeance, but he fought for justice and left Anakin with the consequences of his actions.  In the long run, his mercy ended up leading to the ultimate good. And his example stands in contrast to the test Anakin failed in the first act. 

Or maybe I'm way off the mark. This all just occurred to me. I, at least, think it's a neat way to see the movie.",StarWars,True,1528749431,2018-06-11

A Star Wars Switch Game Idea That Could Actually Happen,"It has bothered me every since the release of the Switch that there hasn’t been any original Star Wars games made for it. It also bothered me that the mobile Star Wars game Star Wars Uprising was shutdown. Uprising had a great story, and handled Jedi the right way. To become a Jedi in that game it was a hard process. Uprising failed for one because it was free, and two because it was online, so it quickly became unprofitable for Disney. I think it would make a good game if Disney used the left over concepts, designs and story, but turned it into a single player game. This would likely be profitable for Disney too, as the switch target demographic is the same as Star Wars, they already have so much material already finished, and it would have to be the go to Star Wars switch gams.

The reason Palpatine chose Cody first,"Many have probably realized the same thing, but I was just thinking about why Palpatine chose to deliver the order to Commander Cody first instead of anyone else. Surely Commander Gree would've had a better chance against Yoda if he hadn't sensed all of the jedi dying first. And I'm sure the forces on Couresant would've been best suited to be prepared as soon as possible.

But Commander Cody had the most dangerous threat to Palpatine's mission. Obi-Wan was the only Jedi that could have turned Anakin back. Palpatine had tested Anakin's loyalty earlier on Grevious' ship and Anakin chose Obi-Wan's life. Because of this, Palpatine knew Obi-Wan had to die first. 

Long story short, Palpatine risked the tactical advantage on a more powerful Jedi he had a personal rivalry with because he knew Obi-Wan was a larger threat to his plans. ",StarWars,True,1528764190,2018-06-11

My predictions of Star Wars Episode 9 Quarter 1,"It's a month after the Battle of Crait and the First Order controls over half of the galaxy.

The Millennium Falcon comes out of hyper space with two x\-wings and a a\-wing. They are above Felucia facing a tie fighter and a light freighter. A hologram of Zay and Shriv pops up. ""We found Lando Calrissian and his new crew out here on Felucia. Is this the entire fleet?""says Zay. ""Yes, we have lost most of our fleet. This is it,""says Rey. ""Okay, let's go to your base on Utapau,""says Shriv. A star destroyer comes out of hyperspace. Kylo Ren is standing on the bridge. ""Destroy all the ships except for the Falcon. I will kill Rey myself,""he says. ""As you wish,""says General Hux. Poe says, ""I wish Leia was here to command us."" ""I agree. Attack!""says Rey. A porg makes a noise as a x\-wing gets shot down by the star destroyer. Some ties emerge from the hangar bay. Poe destroys a one of the shield generators.  ""Poe and the Falcon will stay and fight. Everyone else escape,""says Rey as she destroys a tie. ""Okay,""says Shriv. The other ships jump into hyperspace towards Utapau. ""Don't track them. Track the Falcon. There is few planets that we don't,""says Kylo. ""As you wish,""says General Deece(He's a new character).  Poe blows up the hangar along with Kylo's tie fighter. ""Woo hoo!"" ""Keep it up General Poe Dameron,""says Rey destroying the other shield generator. ""We must retreat Supreme Leader Ren. Our ship will be destroyed soon and our hangar is gone,""says General Deece. ""Retreat,""says Kylo. The ship goes into hyperspace. ""Let's go to Utapau,""said Rey. ""Will do,""says Poe going into hyperspace with Rey behind him. ""We made it out alive Chewy."" He makes a noise and R2 comes in with C\-3PO. ""Hello Admiral. A wookie was playing Dejarik with Damon Janin and the wookie lost and he is beating up Damon."" ""That's just great,""says Rey. She enters the main part of the ship and she sees them fighting. Finn and Rose are watching. Finn kisses Rose. ""After the war we can go to a distant and get married,""says Finn. ""I agree,""says Rose. ""Stop it!""says Rey to the wookie. He makes an angry noise. ""It's fine. I suggest you let the wookie win,""she whispers to Damon(the second sentence that is).

""That sounds good. Rose, Finn, come with me to make plans with the Resistance Council,""says Rey. 

Kylo's star destroyer comes out of hyperspace above Naboo. ""Will we assault Theed?""asks General Hux. ""Not yet. I'm sure that the Resistance will come and try to help Theed. We will take Naboo and destroy the Resistance at the same time,""says Kylo Ren. ""Sounds good,""says General Deerce. General Hux thinks about killing Kylo Ren during the battle. 

""We must go and help soon,""says Captain Ty Kain, an Nautolan. ""Agreed but we need more men,""says Finn. ""We could ask the Empire. They still own Coruscant,""says Rose. ""That is a good idea but what if they say no Captain Tico,""says Commander Lenna Arekson. ""We can try,""says Rey. ""Let's do it,""says King Chicri. ""But, who should go?""asks Captain Kain.

Question for you collectors,"Do you open them or keep them boxed when buying new/old toys? I can’t decide if I should display my figures out of their boxes or not. They aren’t valuable, they’re from the 90s and early 2000s but they may be some day. Definitely it’d be easier to display just the figures and not the boxes too especially carded ones as they don’t sit up right. I have a few battle packs, a couple unleashed figures, Sith evolutions figures, some of the 12 inch figures, an old micro machine set, special edition boba fett, a C3PO funco, and I’m expecting a black series in the mail. That I believe is my entire boxed collection. I collect for investing but if one day they were worth something that’d be nice. This question can go for anything really not just Star Wars. I collect all sorts of toys and some are sealed. I did open my Spawn figures, once again because of cards. Also they were worth not much at all so I didn’t feel bad.

My crazy theory about the end of Solo,"Now, I know this is completely wild speculation, and almost definitely not true, but it's just a thought.

This person, who seems to be wearing makeup/tattoos (possibly with horns, but maybe I was imagining that) grabs a double bladed lightsaber and ignites it. Now this could be anyone, Darth Vader, Palpatine, maybe even Obi\-Wan,  but that's not what I think. I think this is actually Darth Maul. It sounds insane, I know, but think about it. Darth Maul is alive in this time period, his voice is pretty similar to Sam Witwer, he has all the tattoos, (and horns) he has robotic looking legs, he can use the force, and he has a double bladed lightsaber (though his got destroyed in TPM). These are all crazy connections, for sure, and it's almost definitely not anyone else but Palpatine, but this is just the vibe I got. Thoughts?",StarWars,True,1528785702,2018-06-12
An honest question to the fans who rate ROTS so highly...,"I want to know your take on the entire sequence leading up to and including the antics on the Invisible Hand at the start.  I appreciate the later drama that the movie portrays with Anakin's turn but as far as raw movie enjoyment goes I find it hard to get there when I have to slog through the first third of the movie.  I find AOTC and TPM more tonally consistent even if they're not great movies so I find a re-watch a bit more enjoyable, maybe because I know what I'm getting myself into?  I find TPM to be the kids' Star Wars and AOTC the pre-pubescent teens' Star Wars but ROTS is some kind of jarring amalgamation of decent drama with the themes of the previous two instalments.

My predictions for Episode IX,"There are any that Rian Johnson has made it impossible to produce an interesting story because of TLJ. I say they are WRONG. 

The title of the film will be called Star Wars Episode IX: Revenge of the Force Ghosts. See below for what I think will happen:

Now that we know force ghosts like Yoda can use lightning to destroy trees we will get a great lightning battle from the dead jedis of the past. It will be such an epic battle with each force ghost using the power of the skies to try and kill Kylo Ren. Rey will now realise the power of the force ghost and also decide to become a force ghost and summon lightning from the skies to strike down the evil shirtless Kylo Ren. Oh and now that they have all of a sudden discovered they can use hyperdrive as a weapon we will see massive space battles where x-wings go into hyperdrive to destroy the new death star and massive frigates. Who needs those damn slow bombers at the start of TLJ when you have x-wings that can hyperdrive into everything right?

An objective view,"Let me just get this out of the way, I didn't like TLJ... At all. But I wanted to talk about TFA. When I first watched it, I liked it, however seeing all the fans reactions really killed it for me, initially at least. 

Taking a step back however, I delved into the music, because John Williams. In the end, what really sold me was the music. At first the characters seemed kind of bland, kind of like using the same grounds of coffee to make two different pots of coffee at two different time, but watching interviews with John Williams, and how he was able to create such a powerful soundtrack after all these years, I discovered that each piece delivers another aspect to the story. Each character theme portrays an aspect of the character that helps the viewer/ listener better understand each character, and helps with their performance and ultimately really sold the movie to me. Now TFA is a really enjoyable experience. 

On my way to work, I put on a shuffle playlist of TLJ, and once again John delivers. Maybe one of these days TLJ will grow on me. Maybe EP IX will really turn my opinion around. 

Was there ever a defining moment where music has helped you see the better part of one of the movies?

TLDR: Didn't like TFA, but the soundtrack helped me discovers aspects previously unseen. ",StarWars,True,1528791028,2018-06-12

Why can’t boys/men just have Star Wars?,"I don’t understand this political agenda to feminize Star Wars. Woman generally are interested in other genres of movies to their own accord. You don’t see a public decry of how the Notebook should be made more appealing for men because men/boys don’t care about the love story/kiss in rain genre. 

When it comes to the tropes in Star Wars, one of the main ones is sword fighting. Woman generally are not interested in sword fighting as much as males are. You don’t see little girls pretend sword fighting in the playground. You don’t even see woman obsess deeply over Star Wars as much as men. The coolness factor of Star Wars is interpreted differently between the sexes. Males are emotionally moved by the spectacle of a fight and exotic ness, while woman are emotionally moved more by relationship dynamics. Maybe it’s just me but I don’t see this ever changing. 

Look at the direction Star Wars began to go pre Disney. The old republic and the games that were being produced like the force unleashed. It was all about spectacle, power and sword fighting. In the new movies we get none of that. Stat wars with barely any lightsabers or decently choreographed fights.

Why can’t boys/men have Star Wars? Why does it need to be diluted for mass appeal? Are woman/girls  even asking for this?

The most divisive Star Wars scene of all time: The Phantom Menace pod race?,"People seem to have very strong opinions on the pod race scene in The Phantom Menace. It's really a ""love it or hate it"" scene. Some people say it was garbage and one of the worst parts of the movie. Other people say it was incredible and it was the highlight of the prequels. (Personally I'm in the latter category. It's my favorite Star Wars scene ever.)

I get why some people don't like it. It's VERY long, and you know that Anakin is going to win. The scene is all spectacle.

But I think the spectacle is just so good, and the scene works really well as the center piece of the movie. There's so much build up to the scene, and it pays off. The visuals and sound effects are so cool. It's such a unique and memorable sequence. I can't think of anything else like it. (Except maybe that live action Speed Racer movie? That movie was dope.) 

Anyways I was wondering what you guys think of the pod racing scene? Do you love it or hate it, and why? ",StarWars,True,1528809223,2018-06-12
I have yet to see a good excuse for boycotting Solo,"Whenever I hear someone mention the movie, either here or irl, someone always brings up the fact that they refuse to see it, which I just find utterly ridiculous. 

Before I go any further, I should clarify some things. I’m not saying that you should be forced to see the movie, and I’m not talking about people who don’t have the money or some other good excuse to see it, I’m talking about those who have said they are actively boycotting it out of what just seems to be spite. I’ve seen and heard people call themselves “huge Star Wars fans” and then say that they refuse to see it because they didn’t like the last movie which has absolutely no connection to this one besides taking place in the same universe. I know I’m gonna have people calling this gatekeeping but boycotting something that you claim to love just makes no sense. And saying that the trailers didn’t look good doesn’t make sense either considering that those are just trailers and that since the movie has come out pretty much everyone I’ve heard from has said that they’ve enjoyed it, and it seems like here most of us enjoy it as well. Maybe it’s just me but this makes absolutely no sense to me, and if I see someone give me an actual reason instead of just pure spite, I will concede and take this all back.",StarWars,True,1528809846,2018-06-12

[Spoilers] An Idea of where to go with a certain character after Solo.,"I have always liked Maul he's cool as fuck. I think with some smart planning and retconning his story could be a great star wars story arc.

If we go from episode 1 to Maul cloning himself somehow we can carry on his story after his death in Rebels. 

We could make it so that Maul's species can only be cloned to the extent of the original explaining the legs not being on the clone. We could also make it so that his power over the darkside is non transferrable or not part of the cloning process. 

Then we are left with Maul as a crime boss coming up to episode 4. If we got a Crimson Wave movie we could meet the characters of Solo again and we could have a decent villain for hermit obi wan to have.

My Theory On The Split Between Fans Over The Last Jedi,"No this isn't about who is a ""true fan"". The Last Jedi really reveals how different people see the same film in different ways. 

There are feeling types, sensation types and thinking types. For people viewing movies scenes that generate feelings, which are by nature irrational, i think it succeeds in most scenes to build an emotion in the audience. Visually theres lots of flashy stuff on the screen. That appeals to sensation types. But  for logical, plot minded people, TLJ has far more plot holes and questionable character choices than any Star wars movie. 

To illustrate, lets look at just one scene: The bomber scene at the beginning.  On the surface it is visually stimulating (spaceships, explosions) and its got an emotional build up (the girl has to sacrifice her life to destroy the bad guys... its tense and quite well built up suspense). 

But for anyone with a logical mind, it has so many problems; why is the pilot suddenly unconscious for no reason? Why do these bombers blow up easier than the Hindenburg? Why are they slower than any spaceship in Star wars? They have to position themselves directly over the target?? Can they be used for anything other than suicide missions? How would they move out of the way of their own explosions? Why don't they use Y-Wing Bombers instead of these slow fragile ships? Why do the bombs drop straight down, is there gravity in space? Why doesn't the air get sucked out, is there a force field? Etc. (some of those questions may be answered in other materials, but regardless, those are the questions that often race through peoples mind when they first experience the scene). 

If you were a thinking-type person. It's a mess! But emotionally, it basically works.

The whole film is like that. Scene after scene of either visually interesting ""flashy"" stuff, or emotional scenes that basically work on an emotional ""gut feeling"" level, but never the slightest thread of logic or reason behind any of it. 

Thats why you have such a huge split in the reactions of viewers. Because we all look for different aspects in the same movie to decide whats ""good"". ",StarWars,True,1528816529,2018-06-12
Seriously fuck mr plinkett.,"The prequels are some of the best star wars stories and movies ever made. i know everyone says they have bad dialogue and bla bla bla bla... but seriously ive never seen anything like them in my lifetime ever, the score is absouletly beautiful the worlds like naboo and coruscant are amazingly beautiful the relationships and story telling is brilliant, just absolutely amazing all around. i dont care what anyone says, they are just as good if not better than the original trilogy, honestly han and leia had cringey moments the acting in the original trilogy wasnt great either and the dialogue wasnt great either, everything an OT fan boy says about the prequels can equally be said about their beloved movies they grew up with, like their were loads of technical mistakes and bad dialogue and generic acting in the original trilogy that i think is done a lot better in the prequels. they are so unique and have their own style to them. people just dont understand georges vision, their like silent films with the dialogue there for explanation, just the visuals alone with john william's amazing score and the facial expressions from the actors, is really what makes those movies amazing, i never will understand peoples hate for the prequels, they're not generic hollywood blockbusters their unique brilliant movies with great moral messages, that all came from a mind of a creative genius. a shakespearin play and a saturday morning serial matinee had a baby and created the star wars prequels, absolutely fantastic. and thats not even counting the clone wars tv series. which expands the already great story of the galactic republic becoming the galactic empire. so all i gotta say is i love george lucas and what he did for his franchise, and fuck mr plinkett's reviews and all the other people complaining about shit they don't understand, yall are the reason lucas sold the company and its sad cause i feel like im one of the only people who actually understood what lucas's vision was for the star wars prequels.",StarWars,True,1528816744,2018-06-12

"Is there any chance Disney retools post the Solo box office results, and we see an R-Rated Star Wars films, like a gritty Boba Fett Western?","I had been thinking about this, in context with Kennedy possibly needing to take a peak at Marvel's ability to deliver blockbusters that are also not totally saccharin and without an auteur's eye.... it's obviously Star Wars is bent on delivering consumable popcorn IP that makes money while trying to be everything to everyone, making it somewhat of a hollow, lifeless franchise of sorts.

So, would either Kennedy or Disney be able to look at the performance of the recent films, coupled with any potential opportunities to make the films more engaging and hopefully more successful for the overall IP in the long run, and make that out-of-character decision to allow more artistic risk, less production control in favor of individual director stories, and potentially find their way into an R-Rated corner of the universe?

[Fanfic] If I had written the sequel trilogy...,"I'm not a writer, so I'm not going to try to write a short story here. Instead, I wanted to share my vision for a sequel trilogy that would fit better with the state of affairs following RotJ:

Episode VII: 

(crawl)

It is a time of peace in the republic. Following their defeat at Endor, and the loss of most senior officers, the Empire has fractured. While some Star Destroyer commanders have set themselves up as warlords in outer rim, the majority of the Old Empire has fled to the deep core systems.

Prime Minister Leia Organa Solo leads the New Republic senate, while Han struggles to adapt to a life of politics and state dinners.

Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker has created a new Jedi Academy in the old Rebel temple base on Yavin IV, where he works to train a new generation of Jedi Knights...

(opens to Jedi training at the temple)

Focus on a young group of junior Jedi knights: Rey, Finn, Poe, and Ben Solo. They are happy, training with their force powers, and learning to fight with light sabers. Ben finds himself troubled by dark dreams, and a voice calling to him, calling to his ...grandson?

Then, emergency! A group of Star Destroyers has come out of hyperspace directly over Coruscant, catching the New Republic completely by surprise. Luke and the other senior Jedi prepare to leave Yavin to help the battle, but order Rey and friends to stay behind. They are too young, incomplete is their training. Stay, watch over the others.

Rey says ""fuck that"", and proceeds to steal the Millennium Falcon (Han and Leia were visiting Luke) and race to catch up with the rest of the Jedi.

*Insert big battle scene here.*

Rey and company board one of the Imperial ships. During the fighting, Ben's visions become even stronger. He feels a call to go to a strange planet, deep in the core systems, where he believes he will find his grandfather. He breaks from the group, steals a ship, and sets off on his journey.

Rey and friends eventually defeat the commander of the Imperial Armada, who reveals that there is a new Sith lord, cloaked in shadow, immensely powerful, who has guided to New Empire toward great victories. He is not one man, but everyone, and no one...

On the strange planet, Ben is led deep into a cave. The place is strong with the Dark Side of the Force. Shadows and mist encircle him. The voice of his grandfather speaks from the darkness, beckoning him forward. Eventually he is face to face with Darth Vader! They engage their light sabers and dual, but when Ben strikes the killing blow, Vader vanishes in a cloud of smoke, only to reappear behind him! Ben realizes that this is not his grandfather, but a manifestation of the darkness that possessed Anakin Skywalker.

Back on Coruscant, the battle has been won, and our hero's are picking up the pieces. Leia wonders if this is the start of a new assault by the Old Empire. Han dismisses the attack as an overzealous warlord biting off more than he can chew. Luke, however, feels a new darkness, one that he has not felt in a long time... Han and Leia feel it to.

Cut back to the strange planet. Kylo Ren steps out of the cave, tattered and bloody. As the screen fades to black, he says ""I will finish what you started Grandfather. At last you will have your revenge.""",StarWars,True,1528826587,2018-06-12

I think the Han solo we got is not the same one from 4-7, and that's fine. He's the primordial Han Solo. He's still learning how to be a suave, cocky smuggler. 

When you swing your first bat, throw your first punch, or strum your first chords, you're not going to be an expert at it, and Solo certainly is not an expert at his trade in this movie. But he's trying. 

The movie felt star wars-y to me. It gave me an appreciation for the gloom of the post-republic era. It was cool. 

I also thought the throwbacks and tributes to the other films were great. There were a lot, maybe too many, but still good! 

There was a good amount of storytelling and action. One did not overpower the other. There were a lot of turns as well. Some were highly predictable, some not so. But that's to be expected from Star wars.

Hux is trying to get on to power with the help of part of the First Order high command and industrials as well as organised crime like Hutt cartel. They consider Kylo Ren to be an usurper ,idealist devoted to ancient religion , craving power but also to bring order and peace to the galaxy, which is against their interests to maintain prolonged wars and disorder.

Finn and Rose fly to Batuu where their link (later revealed was send by Hux) to First Order's secret is.A blue skinned woman alien (Chiss race ) is kept as prisonner.She escaped from secret facility.

Rey , Chewy, R2D2 and C3Po arrive on the unknown planet located by Rey.Its an ocean planet ,covered almost entirely by oceans except few islands.They land on the largest island that is just some dosen kilometers wide, with palms, white sand beaches and enormous structures made from rocks weighting thousands of tons arranged like domino blocks scattered around and one on top of the other.The island is abandoned, Rey finds only old traces of primitive almost stone age activity.And a massive Force tree in the shadow fo rock mensa, Uneti tree bigger than on Ahch\-To.Suddenly a 2 magnificent avian creatures arrive from the sky.They sport wingspan of over 20 meters, with four X shaped wings,which they can foil back as an arrow and dive like jets towards Rey.Animals are evolution product that looks like combination of bird, Orca and dinosaur and are magnificat ,intelligent and beautiful. Rey thinks to run away from gigantic creaturs as they dive fast towards her at, jet the birds extend their wings in a last moment, glide over Rey and start birds cry from excitement . They are domesticated creatures, Rey finds saddle on the one of it .Birds are wounded, have many scars, obviously struggling to survive.They haven't seen their masters for long time.

In the meantime Finn and Rose release prisoner and she leads them to the planet where First Order has secret production facility.

 Kylo finds about the conspiracy against him, and peace and prosperity that leads to technocracy, industrials and rich people who mostly gather on Canto Bight,they generate profits by maintaining constant war ,thus they also finance the rebels as well as First Order, as the peace in the galaxy is not in their interest . The Hutts are also involved in it. Hutts despise him particularily for his mother Leia, a Hutt. slayer. General Hux  coordinates them.Kylo senses treason and lures many leaders in the conference room, shuts the door and kills them all with his Ligh saber.He kills Hux the last while he beggs for his life.Than he orders his forces to ocuppy Canto Bight and other places and destroy conspirators. This includes the Hutts and other criminals organisations. Kylo actually purges the filth from the galaxy.    A

The storm begins on a ocean planet. Suddenly a First Order fighters arrive above island , they destroy Millennium Facon that was on the ground.End of Millennium Falcon.First Order fighters consider mission acomplished, an intruders as eliminated.Rey, droids and Chewbacca barely escape and hide in the Force tree. There Rey feels the call from the Force, and finds that within the tree there is entrance to the cave beneath the.In the cave Rey finds tapestry of ancient cave paintings on the cave walls depicting various eventa in a stone age cave paintings. Above every painting on the cave wall there is a color imprint of a hand of the author .When she touches the painted hands a Force visions almost like a hologram fills the cave explaining the cave panting.

Rey follows story of the paintings which fill the cave like holograms: Human race originates from a planets that no longer exist.Thousands of generations ago those people were the first sentient beings that mastered knowledge about the Tide, which is the Force.They were the brightest beings in the galaxy for millennia and galaxy have prospered, it was the first Galactic civilization.Their technology was far above the technology level of galaxy to date.They mastered Force technology for prosperity.

Than a schism happened ,and catastrophic war, because some believed they can use the Force for their cause, and thus created Dark Side sect and as a result Light Force sect emerged to oppose it.The ancient war of epic proportions happened ,which devastated the galaxy. Planets that were once the core of this civilization were completly obliterated, a thousand star systems vanished. As a result of this war at the place od haeviest battles a barrier formed in the center of the galaxy, comprised of black holes, space storms and other weird anomalies, known today as a barrier that prevents safe communication between the two parts of the galaxy. Some survivors from this bloody war, a crew on an enormous dome \-shaped space station came to this ocean planet seeking refuge.They landed the 100 kilometers spherical dome shaped space station touching down the floor of the depest ocean on this planet.They sweared never ever to use technology and their knowledge about the Force. They settled on the planet calling it Lew'el, meaning Deluge, and lived for thousand of generations without any technology, living from the sea, using domesticated avian creatures for travel and hunt.Those people were all Force sensitive. Their shamans preserved precious original knowledge about the Force.

Finally on the wall Rey founds a recent picture of an X\-wing and a person. Rey touches hand imprint above it and last story unfolds. Decades ago Luke Skywalker has visited this planet, and saved young girl form certain death in the storm.Many years later he revisited the planet when she was now a grown woman. In this moment Rey realizes this is actually another Force cave as it reacts on her presence.

Rey watches the girl saved by Luke becomes a woman, as she walks from one side of the cave and stands in the center.From the other side of the cave she sees Darth Vader, and near him Luke Skywalker as he looked in Empire Strikes back.Vader and Luke walk towards the woman.Vader than turns in to Jedi Anakin . Than Anakin positions behind Luke and dissappears , and Luke turns in to Luke from the Return of the Jedi. Luke approaches woman and they look each other affectionately, they are in love.Luke calls her name, Aya.

Rey starts to realize the will of the Cosmic Force is behind it all an above all.Rey and Chewy as well as droid's stay on the island for days.

Suddenly Finn and Rose arrive on that same planet.

This desolated planet with apparently no any technology is actually the same planet where First Order has its most significant production facility, most advanced in existance, an ancient Forge. Alien woman tells them story how the First Order came to this planet many years ago and occupied it, enslaving its small population and killing the rest.First order found greatest secret of the planet.A submerged many millennia old Forge, that is still operational. It harvests natural Force [sensitiviy.It](https://sensitiviy.it/) operates by means of senient slave labor within it. Its a desecration of the Force.A Force sensitive slaves from all around the unknown regions have been brought in here to serve as slaves, to make the forge operational. Iz produces endless amounts of weapons and military hardware,just as in ancient war that destroyed the galaxy. Finding the forge enabled First Orders rapid expansion beyond anyone's expectation and explains massive fleets that First Order possess .

During Rey's emotional event in the cave Kylo establishes connection and realises she is on the ocean planet that is known to him already very well.

Heroes decide to infiltrate the base and start the rebellion there. They use birds, wind thrusters,which First Order considers unimportant (except for hunting and sport).Rey uses instinct and mounts one bird, and they fly to the sky.Fin Rose and others follow her.

In the meantime Kylo arrives on the planet, enters the base which uses whirlpool \-like entrance mechanism.

Kylo hears the voice of Luke Skywalker. Kylo Ren than remembers the past, that night when he mutinied against Luke he took some of his students who were already Dark sided acolytes, and slaughtered rest of Luke's pupils.Kylo has studied Lake's compass long before, and has found that Luke's knowledge originates from this planet.Emediately after Kylo and his Knights mutinied, they headed to this planet and found a village on an island.Those people refused to cooperate and Kylo and Knights wiped out the entire village. Luke skywalker came after trhem in his X\-wing.Luke was dark and powerful, angry,he single handedly killed all Knights of Ren except one last and Kylo, which both escaped.That surviving Knight of Ren is now commander of this base.

Kylo Ren remembers the moment when he spared life of a little child in that village during slaughter. He never understood why he has done that.That moment hunted him for years, now more than ever, he can't accept why he did it.

Kylo is the one that discovered this ocean planet in the name of the First Order and has set in motion the future of the Galaxy, just as Luke did before.Kylo reported to Snoke what happened, and Snoke emediately understood that the obscure ocean planet is the refuge planet and lrast expected place with legendary lost Forge, and with people who keep original knowledge about the Force.They will be enslaved and destroyed and Forge utilised.

Rey,Poe, and Rose infiltrate Forge .They start mutiny .Finn is severely wounded but Rose saves him and Poe Dameron comes in a critical moment and helps them. Slaves from many species , all of them Force sensitive help mutiny and free themselves starting the fall of the First Order , destroying their captors.

Kylo Ren fights Rey within the wast internal space of the ancient station, Forge.The station is so big that under its translucent dome there is entire massive forest,which helps in maintaining stability of Force draining mechanism of the Forge.Within station, under theglass like dome there is a many kilometers wide forest of Wroshyr trees.Those are massive trees were crteated by the orignal civilisation, and were a symbol of those people, and the tool in Force techology.,because Life creates IT. Those same trees were in ancient times planted on many planeta, including Kashyyk .On Batuu those trees were burned and petriffied during the ancient war, their petrified remnants are now the sharp rocks on that planet.

Kylo has the upper hand in the duel, he offers Rey the alliance last time, tells to Rey he made mistake for sparing her once, now he will not. On a duel of fates however Kylo gets wound by Finn who finds them and shots Kylo, than Rey funishes him in last stand deffense with the light saber trough his torso .In his last moments, Kylo begs Rey to forgive him, tells her the truth how he sensed she is the chosen,chosen over him, and tells her ""I'we seen your parents, Luke is your father, you are the chosen, bring the balance ,bring the peace."" Rey cries calling him Ben, upon which Ben smiles to her ,and than he passes away. Rey takes his body and board a rescue ship together with Chewbacca and droids and goes back to Ahch \-To. In the meantime more rebell shipps arrive taking liberated slaves from the Forge. Rose activates ancient engines and sets Forge for self\-destruction.Forge lifts off from the ocean, enters the Space above planet and than explodes and wanishes in a gravity well.

Moving upstairs at Ahch\-To ,in the night, Rey sees bluish apparition on the cliff in the distance.With the tears in her eyes as she approaches the apparition, which is Luke Skywalker's Force spirit .The visions of the past emanates from the surroundings trough the Force concluding the story:After the destruction of Jedi academy Kylo Ren and Knights of Ren slaughtered sacred village on Lew'el, but Kylo spared Rey by the will of the Force. Her mother , Aya, died there . First Order than occupied the planet.She was alone for days,hungry and thirsty, in the shock she has made her past die.Luke who have seen slaughter, and after he destroyed Knights of Ren has gone mad. He thought he lost everything, his love, child,sacret village, and he was even forced to kill his own mutinied pupils. Luke has lost everything he had,he closed himself off from te Force, and eventually crushed his X\-wing on Ahch\-to , going to exile,.But Luke has found the unbeliveble truth at the moment of his death.

Days after the tragedy, Luke's old friend and traveler , believer in the Force , Lorr San Tekka , who has heard of calamity came to Lew'el, and took a little girl.He heard of the happenings, about First Order enslaving Force sensitive people, and thus he hide Rey from the sight of anyone in the desert of Jakku.As a Force sensitive she worthed very much, thus he has given her to Unkar hiding her idenitity and Force sensitivity perfectly.Lorr San Tekka still observed her and helped in many ways.

Rey is the ultimate tool of the will of the Force. She is a daughter of a woman which represented the fathers of the galactic civilization and the knowledge about the Force, and a man that represents final intervention of the Force trough the birth of Chosen One, Anakin, and his son .Rey is the fulfillment of the ultimate will of The Force to bring the balance,heal the wounds of the galaxy by uniting beginning and the end , old and new. Rey is the true Chosen one.She represents the history of the Galaxy and the will of the Force.

Rey looks at Luke,he looks et Rey.After emotional scene Rey burns the body of Ben Solo.The Force spirit of Luke Skywalker is joined by her mother Aya, Force spirit of Ben Solo joins them and than Cosmic Force brings the immortal spirit of Han Solo to , for his contribution to the balance .

Rey looks in Force spirits around her, than turns her look in to a distance .Force spirits fade. Rey is willingly closing herself off from the Force, briging the balance, and handing over the future back to the Will of the Force.

I think the crowd definitely had something to do with it, it was the liveliest crowd with a ton of laughter and clapping at the end. There was probably like 15 people total but they were loving it haha. I went opening night and it was sold out but this experience was so much more fun. And the movie does not slow down it has so much to discover on each watch. On this watch I found out Warwick Davis actually had multiple lines.

The logistical nightmare of moving your capital to a new planet every seven years.,"The more I think about the time period post RotJ the less and less sense it makes to me and the more I feel like it was set up the way it was just to set the stage for TFA. And one of those ways is finding out how the FO could destroy the capital of the republic while not having them destroy a important planet like Coruscant.

The answer was to move the capital of the New Republic to a new planet via voting every seven years. Now its at this point where I have to stop and start asking if the author sat down and thought about this. Sure having the NR move the capital from Coruscant to explain why it wasn't Corsucant that was blown up was necessary. But having it move so much leads to some nasty problems. 

First lets start with the voting. IT was decided that by moving the capital around it would make the NR less core centric than the OR was and more tied to the mid and outer rim. Now we don't know how specifically voting was done but their are very few ways you can stop people from cheating at the vote. So here we have 

problem 1) Buying and Selling votes: Richer, more powerful planets could better afford to advertise for their planet to be selected and to create back room deals to buy the votes of other planets. They could offer to help pay for a large project, give a good deal on shipping, promise to buy X amounts of Y products. That would lead to these rich core planets still being the ones in control of where the Senate is located and where the Senate is focused on. 

So its not as ""fair"" as they would want it on first glance. But lets say the vote passes lets move on to the second problem. 

Problem 2) Location of Coruscant and the New Planets

Coruscant is known as Triple Zero. The X, Y, Z coordinates of all galactic maps are set with it as the center. That is because since the birth of the Old Republic it has been the seat of galactic power. Part of this is because of it setting at the end of two major hyperspace lanes with two more major ones connecting onto the previous ones. So its very easy and quick to get material and people from all over the galaxy to that planet. A planet that has the history of being the capital. 

So now lets imagine a new planet, say a mid rim one, not to far out but still off the hyperlanes. Its going to take a bit longer to get there. Maybe the route is more complicated or just a bit longer due to hyperspace physics. But its going to be a pain. And why does that matter? Well for the next two parts, materials and security. 

Problem 3) Building a capital

Coruscant like we said had been the capital since the dawn of the OR. This long history, as well as the size of the planet its self means they already have a few things there that make work easier. 

They already have a senate large enough to house the whole NR. A building for their supreme court, a galaxy class medial center for all of the different species, a galaxy class space port for all of the thousands of ships that will be flying important senators and their aids in and out, housing for the senators and aids and their families, the militarizes HQ, and the infrastructure to carry all of that. 

Right now we have 40,131 people working at the UN or about 47k in Washington (And while droids could cut down that number we would still need people to take care and repair them and places to house them). That is ~48.5k people for one single world.

Now imagine you are Naboo. You don't just have 48.5k people coming. You have 48.5kX100 systems (a fraction of the OR or empires 1024 regional sectors) coming.

You have to build new senate chambers large enough to hold them, buildings for them to work in, buildings to house them. These people will need food, dry cleaning, some species will need special medical facilities and doctors. All the things that you planet didn't have before. Over night the population of your capital will explode exponentially. Right now the most expensive Olympics cost 51 billion dollars. Even keeping that  number the same you are going to have to find those funds somewhere.

 And if you are a smaller planet then you have to worry not only about housing all of those people but your own people as well. Do rich senators get to buy land that could have went to your people? Sure their might be a small jump in low skilled labor but also a jump in housing prices, food prices, sewage and trash, as well as putting stress on the metro/airways and the space port.  Even the largest planets will have some trouble with this. And even if you know it will be seven years before your planets turn is up that is seven years you are building/preparing for this event instead of doing something else. 

Problem 4) Security

Going back to coruscant we already said that they have everything built and in place already. That means they also already have the data storage centers in place for all the government documents. Data storage devices that could be lost or intercepted during transit. And devices that new secure locations would have to be created for when moved. They also already have multiple lines of security set up. 

Is the newly chosen planet's security forces going to work well with the NRI when they come in and change all the security codes, set up their own police force and security installations. Thats without even asking if the planets holonet can handle the insane levels of traffic that will now be flowing though it to the planet as it now houses the NR senate plus all other government agencies. 

Thats cyber security and the spies but what about the fleets? Will the Golans be moved from planet to planet? Will this new planet have the size to be able to handle when half the entire First Fleet goes on shore leave? Also moving capitals, even in times of peace, has historically been seen as a unsetteling factor for a society. It causes some unrest. Thats why when people choose a capital it usually stays in one place even if a totally new king or queen takes over.

I know I'm forgetting some important things but this one is just a quick taste of the problems inherent in the system. I may take a deep dive into it later

"Why Kylo is the protagonist of the ST, how it will impact IX, and the legacy of Anakin and Padme.","I see a lot of complaints about Rey beating Kylo, not being as well written as Kylo, etc..
I’ve always kind of subscribed to this being Kylo’s story told through the eyes of Rey. 

In TFA He is humiliated and beaten by a seemingly novice girl, and also just killed his father. His decision was essentially the climax of the film - which pushes everything in TLJ for Kylo. He’s been made a fool in front of his master, and is out to prove himself in TLJ. 

However, Kylo struggles with the light/dark and develops compassion for Rey. Kylo does succeed the most in TLJ in terms of accomplishing anything, but when he has everything he believed he wanted - it turns out he’s still alone. He realizes it cost him everything, and he’s lost the people closest to him. His father, his mother, Rey. 

Much of Kylo’s story is about his struggle to do the right thing. Numerous people have tried to make him turn one way or another, and I believe the only person that can make him turn is himself. 

Sure, others can play a part in that. Rey, Han, Leia, etc.. but he has to make the choice. 

I believe that Kylo will beat Rey if they duel in IX. This completes the “lose the first fight, win the second” thing that happens in many movies. 

More importantly, I think it creates a perfect opportunity for Kylo to make his choice. He and Rey will duel, and he will have the opportunity to kill her. I think he will have the opportunity, but he won’t do it.

The other major thing that I believe will happen in IX for Kylo is being pushed out of the first order. His stunt on Crait has made him a fool in front of his army. Hux could try to use this against him as part of a coup. 

Kylo could a. Leave the first order, or b. Try to keep rule of it. 

Whichever he does, I believe Kylo will come back to being “Ben”, and he will play a part in defeating the bad guys. 

Furthermore, I don’t see them ending the Skywalker/Solo story as a tragedy. If the last person in the bloodline dies evil then what’s the point of the whole story? 

This all started with Anakin and Padme. A failed romance that lead Anakin to the Dark Side, and essentially kills Padme - putting everything into motion. 

People may not be a fan of it, but I think Ben and Rey are the reverse Anakin and Padme. Whether it’s romantic or platonic, Ben’s affection for Rey pulls him closer to the light rather than towards the dark. I think that will be what “I will finish what you started” actually turns out to be. Anakin wanted to be happy, have a family, etc. before all the dark shit went down. Ben will turn back to the light with the help of his compassion for Rey, and he will become a force of good. 

The Rebels scene with the time travel has audio with this as well. 

There’s a bunch of intercut lines with Kylo, Rey, Anakin, and Padme all in the same 20 seconds or so. I’ll try to find it if I can. 

What do people think? I don’t think it has to end up being romantic, but I do think for sure she will play a big part in his redemption.

Obi Wan Movie/ Possible cool content,"So like most people, I can't wait for 2020, when if Disney has any brains, the Obi Wan movie starting Ewan McGregor comes out, but I was wanted to share my thoughts on it.

So of course it will take place in between episodes 3 and 4, and will focus on what Obi Wan was doing, but I personally always liked the relationship between Duchess Satine and Obi Wan, and would love to see it further explored in some sought of media (TV or movie)

 So my first thought was to include it in flashbacks in obi wan solo film. I think this would make lots of sense, he's isolated, he's a hermit, and because of this he's probably thinking of the past a lot, and this will let us see Obi Wan between 1 and 2, and possibly Even more of him during the Clone Wars. (They can probably make him younger with make up) So overall this would be a movie and than it has flashbacks to obi wan past

The other thing I was thinking of is a TV show (probably animated) between the clone wars and episode 1.

STAR WARS POST GENERIC GREAT MOVIE,[removed],StarWars,True,1528874286,2018-06-13
Don't understand when people say an Obi-Wan in the desert story lacks material for a movie,"The main argument I hear against an Obi-Wan film is that there is nothing compelling to tell regarding an Obi-Wan movie in the desert. This never made sense to me since the job of the storytellers is to develop a compelling story, no matter where or what the circumstances. And I see no reason that it would be difficult to develop a story in 20 year period about a man who has seen the rise and fall of his apprentice and seen the rise of a tyrannical power. Delving deep into ones mind is something we haven't seen before in a Star Wars movie. And another argument I hear is that he can't leave the planet. Using storytelling conventions such as flashbacks he can most definitely be shown having an adventure off the planet. And for a movie that delves into the psyche flashbacks would be great to enhance the story by contrasting his past with his present situation.

If you're still against the idea, and I know many on this sub are for this film but I've seen criticism elsewhere, here's my quick pitch:

Kenobi spends time in the desert sensing the quick degradation around the galaxy due to the Empire's reign soon after the events of ROTS. Have his misery be contrasted with flashbacks to the Clone Wars where him and Anakin are on adventure showcasing how close they once were. These flashbacks should allow for the audience to see a contrast in what once was and now what is. Although there is little to no room for a Vader confrontation at some point he had to have discovered that Vader was Anakin. To account for this and not disrupt canon, I would like to see a recreation of the Mustafar scene but as a what if scenario. In this case Obi-Wan tries to grab Anakin as he burns but darkness consumes the vision and as Obi-Wan looks up Vader is walking out of the lava. Vision ends, Kenobi snaps out of it. 

Also have a seen of Obi-Wan communing with Qui-Gon's force ghost. And then to surround these flashbacks/visions have a sub plot where Obi-Wan comes out of his misery to help save a village from some sort of distress.

Obviously I just hashed this out quickly  but I see no limitations to having his story told if they use different storytelling conventions . 

The main reason people want an Obi-Wan movie is to see Ewan Mcgregor again and allow for the prequels to have their chance in the limelight once again, and I really hope it happens.",StarWars,True,1528881903,2018-06-13

Were droids like R2 and BB mass produced?,"I’m aware that there were a good number of R2 units and some other similar units like R4. There’s also BB-9E in TLJ, but if the characters before the dash designate type and after the dash designate serial, it seems unlikely that we’d see the 8th unit or 2nd unit in a galaxy as vast as the Star Wars universe. 

Compare this to the separatist droid army in the prequels where geonosians are mass producing battle droids nonstop. Are most other droids hand made like C3PO, or are there just limited runs since newer models come out so quickly?

Also, if there are so few, how could there be easy access to replacement parts, like when Chopper finds a leg to replace his in Rebels?

A potentially powerful conclusion to Kylo Ren's story.,"Has anyone seen the movie Warrior with Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton?  It's about these two estranged brothers who are both MMA fighters.  Tommy (Hardy) has grown resentful of his older brother Brennan (Edgerton) because he ""abandoned"" him and their drunk/deadbeat father after their mom died so he could run off and get married to his girlfriend.  

Anyway, Tommy is loaded with all this rage and he channels it by just destroying his opponents in the cage.  So this tournament is held in Las Vegas and both brothers enter it because they need the money.  As expected, the tournament ends up coming down to Tommy versus Brennan.

The film is basically a character study about both brothers to see if they can try to move beyond their broken past and achieve some sense of reconciliation with each other.  It's a great film.  And the ending of this movie I think could potentially provide a great blueprint for how they should handle Kylo Ren's character.

SPOILER: As stated before, the film ends with a fight between Tommy and Brennan.  As expected, Tommy initially has the upper hand.  He's a total machine and no one has made it out of the first round with him up until this point.  But in this final fight, Brennan does.  In fact, Brennan actually injures him in their battle.  But Tommy won't quit.  He keeps coming back in an attempt to defeat his brother.  But he can't.  Eventually, Brennan throws him in a submission hold and tells him he's sorry for everything.  But he lets Tommy know that he shouldn't hold on to his rage and anger.  He begs for him to let it go.  To submit.  And... he does.  The film doesn't have an overly happy ending, but it DOES conclude with the brothers leaving the ring together, comforting each other.

Video of the ending: https://youtu.be/27_H7xumAbA?t=97

I could see something like this happening between Kylo Ren and Rey.  At the beginning of their fight, Kylo is completely dominating her.  But she eventually gets the upper hand.  In true Jedi fashion, she has no desire to kill him.  She wants to save him, but she knows it's unlikely to happen.  He keeps digging his heels in and fighting back.  At some point in their fight, she's got his life completely in her hands.  She begs for him to ""come back"" one last time... and he gives in.

This isn't a moment of Kylo Ren becoming a hero.  It's not a ""redemption.""  Rather, it's a moment of Kylo Ren letting go of his hate and choosing to take a shot at becoming a better person.  He surrenders to Rey in hopes that she can help cure him of the darkness that has consumed his soul.  What happens to him next will be a story for another time.  But this could be a powerful conclusion to his arc in the ST.",StarWars,True,1528895674,2018-06-13
Ideas about Jedi Fallen Order.,"I would like that *Jedi Fallen Order* follow the style of *Jedi Academy* and *Jedi Outcast*, with slight role and stealth elements.

A single player game of action adventure with emphasis in the story, because the games of today are usually too complex to stand out both in singleplayer and multiplayer.

Lightsaber combat system as we see in *Jedi Academy*, but faster, with better animations and manual block, with elements from *Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance*: dismembering and being able to cut most object with the lightsaber.

Combat has to focus on melee and Force powers as a complement, while firearms would only be a support.

Improve defense against projectiles: if you keep pressing the block button, you only block the shots, but if you press at the right moment, you deflect the shots.

Force powers more spectacular, as in *The Force Unleashed*, but more pragmatic as in *Jedi Academ*y: categorized on perception, enhanced attributes, defense, offense, telekinesis and ethereal plane, Perception abilties as passive radar, perception of the aura, combat precognition, this could be implemented as translucent attacks symbolize upcoming special attacks of enemies. Enhanced attributes as enhanced agility, dash, speed as bullet time. Defense abilities as shield, mind trick, camouflage, imbue armor with Force for increase its resistance, blind someone, generate electromagnetic pulse. Offensive powers as weaponized dash, sniping lightning. Telekinesis as multitask, for deflect missiles, for grab both living beings and inert objects, for solve puzzles. Ethereal plane abilities as ethereal projection as exploration, possess enemies.

Stealth viable only for non\-Force sensitives and apprentices Force sensitives, because others Force sensitives generally would detect you even if you are camouflaged.

Pixar's 22 tips for storytelling conflicts the Sequel Trilogy several times.,"https://imgur.com/gallery/E8xe0

Tip # 2 ""*You must keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience member, not what’s fun to do as a writer.  They can be very different.*"" - From what Rian keeps reiterating as his reasons for the story choices he made, it makes me feel like he chose what's interesting to write as a writer, and not what was fun for the audience.

Tip #5 ""*What is your character good at and comfortable with?  Throw the opposite at them.  Challenge them and see how they deal with it.*"" - Didn't really see any of that, so I will just leave this here.
Tip #12 ""*Give your characters opinions.  Passive and malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience.*"" - For me, that's a jab at Rey's character overall.  It's justified as her being naive, but in every way she is a malleable character.  She floats through

Tip 15# ""*What are the stakes?  Give us reason to root for the character.  What happens if they don’t succeed?  Stack the odds against them.*"" - This is one of the biggest issues I have with the overall story, but most clearly with Rey.  What is really at stake for her?  What devastating consequences would we have seen if she fails?  Besides that she failed turning Kylo, but she did end up with a dead Snoke and no real consequences.

Tip #18 ""*Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.*"" - lul, could include more than just the Sequel Trilogy here.

Tip # 1 ""*You admire a character for *trying* more than their successes.*""  That's definitely the most opinion thing here, but I think that's a jab at Rey again.  To me, she certainly is never shown tough effort.

Frankly, I think Kylo Rens story is better if there is no Snoke. Kylo going rogue totally on his own is much more interesting than his being manipulated. He's always shown as being a little out of control and his skills aren't well honed... why does there need to be another irrelevant bad guy in the background to whom we need to attribute the training he obviously hasn't been getting?

I imagine Jar Jar might be thrilled to see his old friend again. Anakin might feel a glimmer of joy but that joy would soon turn to sadness and anger at the happy repressed memories he stirred up, once which never again can be realized.

For Example: Darth Vader is thought to be the most powerful user of the force in this universe. So couldn't he just use all of the force at once and surpress planets core to a size just small enough to create a black hole? That would certainly destroy the planet entirely. And the black hole could be removed easily as well; he just has to surpress the thing to a size small enough to let it have a small enough Schwarzschild-Radius to condense completely.

Chekhov's Gun: 13 Setups That Didn't Have A Payoff in The Last Jedi,"If you're unfamiliar with ""Chekhov's Gun"" the video I linked to below does a pretty good job at explaining it. Ignore the examples because you can probably think of better ones yourself. The takeaway is supposed to be an understanding of the principal. The same can be said for the 13 examples below. Although individually some could be discredited, the point is to see it as a whole. I think it's pretty good evidence that The Last Jedi didn't follow this important storytelling ""rule"". \-\-And is really the core reason of ***why*** I didn't like th***e fi***lm. \-\-Not the fans and not who the writer/director is as a person, but th***e fi***lm. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwEjtvaD7JM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwEjtvaD7JM)

TFA Setups  

1. TFA sets up there's significance to Luke's light saber \- it's literally thrown away showing that it meant nothing the whole time  
2. TFA sets up Rey having a significant and cryptic vision \- it's not decrypted  
3. TFA sets up Kylo Ren having a gang called ""Knights of Ren"" \- possibly referenced, but we still don't much about them  
4. TFA sets up Finn getting injured and going into a coma\-like state \- it's not used for anything except for a gag in TLJ. Contrast this with Han at the end of ESB and beginning of ROTJ.   
5. TFA sets up Kylo going to ""complete his training"" with Snoke \- it's never referred to or shown, making it meaningless  
6. TFA sets up victory for the good guys when they blow up the bad guy's base \- it doesn't seem to have an affect on the bad guys or good guys which made the victory feel meaningless. Nothing has really changed.   
7. TFA sets up the importance of Rey's parentage \- they're not important making that question in TFA meaningless  
8. TFA sets up two new bad guys, Kylo Ren and Snoke \- The former is given an explanation and meaning. Subsequently he is generally accepted as the best part of TLJ because they built off the setup. The latter is given no explanation. Which is really the shared fault of both TFA and TLJ.   

TLJ Setups  

1. TLJ sets up Luke to teach Rey three lessons \- they finish two and the third must be unimportant because it's forgotten about for the rest of the movie.  
2. TLJ sets up that there is more to the force or hints that it's going to be redefined in some way when Luke says ""the force isn't just about lifting rocks"" \- Rey literally lifts rocks and our/her understanding of the force doesn't change. \-\-I guess one could say Luke's astro projection shows us how it's changed but that's not really portrayed on screen very clearly as a payoff to that setup.   
3. TLJ sets up DJ selling weapons to the good guys and bad guys \- which ends up being meaningless information.  
4. TLJ sets up Rey not being strong enough to resist the dark side because when she went into the pit w/ mirrors she doesn't resist it. Luke tells her this. \- When Kylo  tempts her with the dark side she easily resists. Making the supposed struggle undermined. Contrast this from Yoda telling Luke he needs to finish his training before confronting Vader. Luke looses and subsequently returns for training. Why does Rey need Luke anymore?   
5. TLJ sets up Snoke being the only one powerful enough to connect Rey and Kylo via visions \- after Snoke dies Rey and Kylo have another vision which makes that setup inconsistent.  

Note: It's important to make a distinction. I'm not pointing out examples of where the writer/director subverted the Star Wars mythos. I'm 100&amp;#37; okay with that if it's well executed. ",StarWars,True,1528927000,2018-06-13

"A argument against ""Disney give us what we want""","So I've seen many content greators and social media personalities demanding that Disney cut the crap and ""just give us what we want"". I belive that in doing this Disney would not be doing us any favors and here is why. 
I believe the idea that Disney should ""just give us what we want"" is completely wrong. They could come out with a pure fan-service film taken from the best fan stories, but personally I'm not going to see that film. If I find a YouTube fan-film made like that, yes sure I'll watch it and think ""hell that was so cool"" but it's just, that a unsurprising, all anserring, action pact, cool looking film not a story driven one.
Yes the Last Jedi had flaws (some character arcs, namely Fins, were badly written) but the main reason it got so much hat was : it was not what we were expecting. We spent 2years listening to theories, ideas and speculation about what would come and so when Disney said ""no actually Snoke is not the big bad, and he is not going to fight Luke.... "" we were so sad that we turned on them because they had kill our expectations, our hopes, our dreams and so somehow killed Star Wars.
I remember the first critics I read about The Last Jeudi : people at IGN said ""it may be better than Empire Strikes Back"" and many critics agreed. Then about 2 weeks latter internet turned, we had the time to calm down after the initial ""that was awesome"" and nit-pick, and nit-pick, and nit-pick until it became a new sport. And a video named ""WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON AT LUCASARTS? "" is a lot more eye-catchy than ""HOW GREAT WAS THE LAST JEDI ?"".
What's more the now Legends stories are still a base of reference for many characters after ep6, and our hatred towards Disney for getting rid of it is silly :what would you have them do? We had filled up all the time before and after the trilogies so unless they said ""this happens a billion years after Yavin, all your favorite characters are dead and probably forgotten"" they were some what stuck with giving us : and retelling of a Legends store, or a smaller conflict that happed during the Trilogies. But the fist idea would have been boring for fans because we most of us have or would have read the books, and the second idea lacks the epic center of the galaxy plote we had come to expect. But if they made a huge time jump they may as well start a new ip Star Conflict and forget about SW.

Once again the film was not perfect far from it but the response has been awfull in my mind because of expectations and content greaters need of views, because if one personne beings and mob will soon rise up and it will be suicide to oppose a internet mob on social media so the snow ball of hate just keeps rolling.",StarWars,True,1528932752,2018-06-13

"Scope, Mysticism and Star Wars","So I'll start this off by saying that I understand why, financially, this is the way things are in a corporate-driven Star Wars production.  Still, here are my thoughts:

One thing that I really loved about KOTOR2 was the lore.  The explanation for each member of the triumvirate's relationship to the force, how each one was moulded into a personification of some trial or suffering, was very interesting.  You really felt like there was an expansive story and universe to back up every character's motivations.  You got to explore ancient places shrouded in mysteries like Korriban and Dxun.  Everything about that game seemed to have depth and development, and I felt as if every pixel had an ancient secret to reveal.

The prequels(which I personally enjoy) continue this thread, although instead of focusing on lore and mysticism they are heavy on the politics of a massive, living, complicated galaxy.  Again, I always felt with the prequels that there was immense depth well beyond the primary story being told.

While the sequences in TLJ where Luke first teaches Rey about the force, and Yoda with Luke at the book tree, are my favorite star wars scene of all time, I still feel as if the depth described above is missing from the two sequel movies so far.  The galaxy feels smaller than ever, and the stories equally small.  In part I feel as if Disney is trading the massive scope of Star Wars for these tighter, more personnal stories.  While I enjoy most of these personal stories(excluding Rose, why tf was she needed), I really miss the wider universe portrayed in other SW stories. 

There was an excellent opportunity to go back to the sort of mysticism and lore that we had seen before with Snoke, The Knights of Ren, Ach-To, etc...but my hopes for expansion on any of those topics pretty much died with the Supreme Leader.  Perhaps Rey would renew the jedi order with greyer, more practical doctrines, while Snoke/Kylo' s rendition of the Sith would approach the ""grey"" force from the other end as they and their knights establish a benevolent overlordship.  Then, we could see the universe as a whole evolve alongside the characters.  Instead, we seem to have just fallen back into the ""blue lightsaber good, red lightsaber bad"" mentality.  Obviously, the protagonists are very complex, but I don't yet feel a connection between their complexities and the world around them.

 The New Republic(rest in lots of charred pieces) and the First Order are really just plot devices so that we know who is on whose side.  There is little to no meaningful sense of how the galaxy has changed politically after the fall of the Empire, beyond knowing that the first order is fighting the resistance.

Again, I enjoy the personal stories and characters (for the most part), but I feel as if the magic of Star Wars is kind of lost.  Any movie can have compelling characters and relationships, but only star wars ever had an entire galaxy to explore, so deep and dynamic that it was a character in its own right.",StarWars,True,1527878845,2018-06-01

"Characters, gender roles, direction and the problem with Star Wars.","The reason many people hate Rey, is not because she is a woman alone, her character is simply horribly written, one dimensional, utterly powerful hero for the sake of being powerful, be it a man or a girl. Has Rey lost any confrontation to date? Does Rey have any real flaws?

1. TFA she beats Kylo at the mind reading game with no prior force training. CHECK
2. TFA Rey taps into the force and defeated Kylo Ren in lightsaber combat. CHECK
3. TLJ Rey one handedly defeats the red guards while at the same time using ninja moves, after having half a day of training. CHECK
4. TLJ Rey comes to the rescue for poor Kylo before the red guard beats him. Kylo Ren the guy who has been trained by Luke and Snoke, gets saved by the rookie. CHECK

SEE HOW STUPID THE REY CHARACTER IS??? All this while at the same time rendering Kylo Ren into a useless villain. At this point in time Anakin had lost an arm, Luke had lost a hand, they both where not the all powerful beings they were set to become yet. Rey on the other hand, has already achieved God status without even trying.

Now the whole ""women"" debacle, that's because Kathleen has been forcing the subject down our throats. Women this, women that, the force is female, etc. Why do we need to shoehorn politics or gender into Star Wars? Oh the main character is a woman! Why? To show women are powerful too!!! Diversity is forced, gender roles and identity are forced, nothing flows smoothly into the story.

I don't think people have a problem with women having prominent roles in Star Wars, the best and most memorable characters in the franchise are women, Leila, Mon Mothma, even Padme, and my all time favorite Ahsoka. Yes, we had a lack of female presence in past movies, true, but shoehorning them into the new movies and rubbing it on people's faces is just plain stupidity. 

Funny how in the new movies, ""powerful"" women have to be portrayed as MANLY and PHYSICALLY strong. It's like women can't be considered strong if they don't become like men. See how dumb that is? There was an interview where George Lucas stated he likes creating powerful women, but the roles and ways in which they show power are not by becoming manly and stuff, they show strength and leadership while staying feminine. Now in cases like mandalorians, it's obvious why those women are physically strong and are equal or stronger than men, but it makes sense in that narrative.

Make it all a female cast, we don't care! As long as their roles and stories fit INTO THE NARRATIVE, it will all be good. But it sticks like a sore thumb when diversity and female empowerment are shoehorned into a franchise for the sake of being shoehorned.

But its a combiantion of many things that have ruined Star Wars: forced politics, ruining legacy characters, disjointed plots, lack of direction, etc etc.",StarWars,True,1527886431,2018-06-01
My Pitch for a Jar Jar Binks movie,[removed],StarWars,True,1527886443,2018-06-01
The reason I want an Old Republic movie is the possibility of finally getting a movie that really makes us *fall in love* with the Jedi.,"To be clear, I already love the Jedi, and I'm sure most of us do. At the end of the day, the force and the Jedi are the heart and soul of Star Wars. Even as fun as Bounty Hunters and X-Wing Pilots and Clone Troopers are, it's the Jedi that really define the core mythology of Star Wars. 

Which is why it's mildly frustrating that we've never had a movie that truly lets us fall in love with their world. 

In the original trilogy, we are teased about the Jedi's former greatness. We cling on to every word that Yoda and Obi Wan give us because we sense they come from a much wider world of Jedi wisdom that we've never seen. The Jedi are fallen, but their spirit lives on. If you grew up with the original trilogy (I'm a 90's kid, so I'm a bit of both), you probably remember trying to imagine, based on the bits of information the OT gives us, what the glory days of the Jedi were really like. 

Then we got the prequel trilogy, and we finally see the Jedi at the apparent height of their power, but... somethings off. I do really enjoy the Jedi as depicted in the prequels- especially in AOTC, where we see some little glimpses into the everyday of Jedi life- but it's clear that George wasn't trying to really idolize them. We're supposed to root for them to succeed, and feel sad when they fall, but... there's an intentional emotional distance there. The Jedi in the PT are very much depicted as a flawed, and not entirely trustworthy, religious and political institution. The story of the PT is told largely from Anakin's point of view, and his story is very much about how he never really fit in with the modus operandi of the Jedi. Therefore, we never really get a chance to fall in love with the Jedi in the PT. 

And in the ST... it's a whole other ballgame. The Jedi are distant legends at this point. The discussion of the Jedi in the ST is largely about tradition and what's important to carry forward and what isn't. Like the OT, the ST is about the Jedi as an idea rather than the Jedi as a present, active force, and while that's cool.... I really want to see the Jedi as an active, present force. 


Something the first few Harry Potter films did exceptionally well is encouraging the viewer to take a moment, or several moments, to just breath in and take in how wonderful and amazing the world is. You feel all of Harry's awe the first time he steps into Hogwarts, or Diagon Alley. You feel the wonder of the Wizarding World. It makes your brain spin with all sorts of ideas about what it would be like to be a Wizard in that world, and go to Hogwarts, and learn spells and all that. I want a Jedi-centric Star Wars film that does *that*. Not a movie about an 11 year old orphan, but a movie that, more generally, encourages us to actively fall in love with the Jedi world. I wanna go to the Jedi temple at it's peak. I want to see the Jedi rally to defend the galaxy against dark forces. I want to see training, lightsaber construction, Jedi being ""knighted""- all that nerdy stuff that makes the universe feel alive. I want a movie that really, fully fleshes out who the Jedi are. 

**TLDR: I'm tired of only having movies where the Jedi are talked about- I wanna see them *in action*, and I want to see a movie that really embraces the fantasy of what it's like to be a Jedi.**",StarWars,True,1527886569,2018-06-01

Solo may hint to something huge in the new trilogy,"So we all know in the end of Solo Darth Maul makes an appearance with his mechanical legs. It while getting me super excited almost got me thinking.

There’s also another Sith lord that a lot of people have being said was killed too early like Darth Maul and he too was also cut in half.

So what if the appearance of Darth Maul was hinting that Snoke will make a similar comeback. It’s not too far fetched too honestly because like Maul Snoke could easily be powered by hatred and want to kill Kylo after he betrayed Snoke. As a matter of a fact I would consider this hatred would be much greater than the hate Maul had for Obi-Wan.

Also Kylo was not well liked amongst the First Order so it’s believable that some loyal soldiers would take Snoke out of there and plan their revenge. 

I’m not saying Snoke is going to come back with spider legs or anything, but it’s just a thought that maybe he isn’t out the game yet. ",StarWars,True,1527886923,2018-06-01

Possible links between recent movies,"So... This is heavy speculation, but I'll go for it anyway.
Now we've seen Darth Maul in Solo, with Qi'ra to serve him, and the rumors of a Kenobi-movie still growing...

I've been a believer of the Rey Kenobi theory for a long time now, and I hoped that there would be a Kenobi movie after EpIX to explain how Kenobi could have gotten a child. Seems like we have a potential mother (bigger chance than Jyn being Rey's mother, according to now dead theories). 

It could be possible Maul finds out about Kenobi's exile on Tatooine (or vice versa) and decides on tracking him down for revenge, once again. This would possibly bring Qi'ra and Kenobi face to face. Even Han could make a comeback (since he had a job/several jobs on Tatooine). He can't meet Kenobi, though, because the two didn't seem very familiar in EpIV. 

They didn't just put Maul in the movie for nothing, they obviously have plans for him in the future movie(s). So what if Kenobi finishes off Maul, and Qi'ra and Kenobi end up having some brief relationship. Of course this would end up with Qi'ra and old Ben breaking up, because he didn't seem to know about having a daughter in EpIV. So Qi'ra finds out she's pregnant, but she doesn't have the money for bringing up little Rey, hence selling her for ""drinking money"" (hey, drinking water is also drinking). 

This would link the Kenobi theories from the main Episodes with possible future stories of the anthology films. Now, I'm not a complete expert on Star Wars lore, nor can I foresee the future. This is a theory coming true with very, very little chance. It's heavy speculation. How I'd see the future movies. So please, if you want to discuss any of this, or don't agree, don't go about spewing hate (""oooo, another Kenobi theory"" *rollseyes*).

Let me explain.

If Disney is not making money from star wars, they aren’t going to spend more money and try to fix it. They are going to abandon it. 
However, if you watch one of their movies because it’s a good high quality film (Solo fits this category) then this will show them how to get people to watch their movies. And they will most likely attempt to continue making star wars films at the same level of quality. 

But if you ignore a good film then the quality jump goes unnoticed and they won’t try to continue it. If you continue to boycott Solo, we may not get an Obi Wan, Boba Fett, Darth maul, or Darth Vader film. Why would they make those if Solo didn’t preform well? That’s bad business. 

So please. Don’t boycott. Go watch Solo. I guarantee it’s better than The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens.",StarWars,True,1527891126,2018-06-01

MY opinion of solo : star wars story,"I hated that fucking sjw droid. They could have made her an more sarcastic c-3po but no we need an fucking sjw bot that talks about nothing other then rights for droids. I was so reliefed and happy as she was finally killed of. I could watch that scene where she gets shot over and over again. I thought she would be in the rest of the movie .Yeah she kinda was important but they could have done it diffrent. The entire plotline of her being for droid rights didnt go anywhere,. Yes the last jedi also had a few sjw scenes but not as in your face as this movie. 



The love plot between han and that girl didnt go anywhere ,it was just kinda thrown in. Realize how i wrote *girl* and not the name of the charakter. She was such a boring charakter that i didnt even remember her name. She was just in there because.  “oh we need an strong woman that the girl can relate to“



Dont get me wrong a lot of the scenes in the movie were really beautiful like the scene on the beach or all of the scenes in the mountans.The small supplot with the pirate gang turning out to be acctualy good was an plot twist that really got me. But the ending had so much plot twists that i wouldnt have been suprised if it turns out generic strong woman charakter was just an alien all along that also workes for the empire and is also a 
Jedi. 

I never got the feeling that i always have when im watching an star wars movie. I never felt anything other than anger against that stupid droid . But i have to say that for what it is something good. It was refreshing to see something diffrent. It felt like an gangster/adventure/ action movie in the star wars universe. 

What did you thing about the movie ?",StarWars,True,1527891606,2018-06-01
Why I’m glad Solo bombed,"First and foremost I want to get this out of the way: I had a great time watching Solo. It was fast, fun, I liked the lead a ton more than I anticipated, Lando and Beckket were unexpected standouts, and I’ve always wanted a Star Wars movie to lean more heavily on the “Western” elements of the series (Seriously, watching this movie is like playing western cliche bingo: Train robbery, Mexican standoff, gambling saloons, mining towns). That being said, I’m glad it bombed.

To put it more accurately: I’m glad that Rouge One did better than Solo at the box office, because I think it shows Disney that old characters aren’t always a safe bet, and that audiences will still pay to see Star Wars films, even if they’re starring new characters. And it’s important to the franchise as a whole to introduce new characters without focusing solely on the old ones.

I’m always irritated whenever the only suggestions for new movies is “A Boba Fett Movie” or “An Obi-Wan movie” I love those characters, but isn’t Star Wars capable of more than that?

Lucasfilm wants to be like Marvel, but I think they’re in danger of taking the wrong lessons from them if they listen to the fans (Guilty as charged.) Marvel didn’t get where they were by making films out of bit characters from their successful films, they keep making new characters, in new films. 

Making a Boba Fett solo movie is like Marvel trying to make a War Machine solo movie after Iron Man’s success. Instead, Marvel makes Ant-Man. Imagine the Star Wars version of the Falcon scene in Ant-Man: Instead of a Boba Fett movie, an underworld movie with an all-new team of Star Wars rouges, but have Boba Fett unexpectedly crashing in as a side character or villain midway through the film!

Granted I think Lucasfilm might be smarter than we give them credit for, since this is exactly what they did with Vader in Rouge One: they promised the audience a cameo from a fan favorite character, but delivered a new cast of characters along the way. It’s likely many fans went in to Rouge One for Vader, but came out with new favorites (Raddus FTW).

It’s in the best interest of both the studio and the fans to keep the franchise going, and to do that they’re gonna need to be able to do something other than recycle, but the best thing is that I think they really are capable of it. Think about how many fan favorite characters and impactful stories have been told in the Star Wars universe completely separate from the OT: The adventures of Domino squad from Kamino to Umbara, The friendship between Poe, Rey, and Finn: The people down at Lucasfilm are a creative bunch, and they’ve proven they have the ability to do this right if given the chance.",StarWars,True,1527893631,2018-06-01

A Hypothesis of Solo's Ultimate Contribution to the Franchise.,"I'm just going to make this long story short. Harrison Ford, to put it lightly, is done with the Franchise. Likewise, he is very picky with his appearances in supplementary materials  (hence why The Indiana Jones animatronics at Disneyland either have their faces blocked or look somewhat off model). 

Alden Ehrenreich on the other hand, seems excited to be Han Solo, as he tries to make his version of the character his own rather than impersonating Ford. 

Ultimately, I feel that Harrison Ford is officially retiring from Lucasfilm related content (either finishing off with or completely withdrawing from Indiana Jones 5) and pass the torch to Alden Ehrenreich for any further appearances as Han Solo (In theme park queue videos, promos, shorts, etc.) Hopefully Solo's box office won't ruin that for both of them.

About John Williams music in the franchise.,"You know throughout the years all the way back from the original trilogy and to now I was wondering if anyone notice a change in John Williams music for Star Wars? When I go back to the original trilogy I notice there are more themes and original music that has a much beautiful melody than compared to now. Like for the new trilogy from force awakens I notice there’s like rey, Kylo and the resistance themes are memeorable but the rest is forgettable, which when I go back to the original and prequel trilogy the music is more grand, memorable and epic, where now since the last Jedi I notice John Williams is just using old themes and repeating them with very little changes. I know the sequel trilogy isn’t done but just based off TFA and TLJ i wanted to know what your guys thoughts on it’s soundtracks were and if you notice a decrease in memorable music. Not saying it’s bad, it’s John Williams and he will always be great but I feel that his lasted songs for the movies don’t stick in my head like the rest do.",StarWars,True,1527899303,2018-06-01
Since Disney took over there are now more bad star wars movies than good. Hype is all Star Wars is anymore. (Spoilers),"So after watching The Last Jedi and hating it. I started thinking about Star wars overall and why it is so hyped up. When in reality now there are way more bad star wars movies than good ones. The original Trilolgy was great. Episdoes 4,5,6 with the original cast of Mark Hammill , Harrison Ford , and Carrie Fischer were just amazing. 

But after that we got 3 prequels which were not very good. I mean there were parts of each movie that was great. in Phantom Menace we got Darth Maul , The Clone Wars was the 1st time we got to see Yoda in action. Revenge of Sith we got Anakins turn even though Hayden Christinason acting was awful. But overall all 3 of the movies were not that good. 

Honestly I am much more forgiving to the prequels than I am the current Star Wars series. The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi were both complete garbage in my opinion.

The spin off movies like Rouge One was Ok i guess but to me it didnt feel like Star Wars at all. Until the final scene.

So at this point I liked the original 3 star wars movies and disliked 7 movies. So for me Star Wars gets a 30 out of 100.

So maybe the Star Wars magic is dead for me. I just dont understand why people are still in love with the new movies when they have been so awful.

The Last Jedi was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. The Force Awakens was not good either but not nearly as bad as Last Jedi.",StarWars,True,1527899329,2018-06-01

Spoiler related question about a cameo in SOLO,"Okay so when we see Maul in ""Solo"" he has the same red inquisitor lightsaber which he uses in Rebels, which I always assumed he acquired while on Malachor or while looking for Malachor because he didn't have another saber. However we learn later in Rebels when Ezra goes to Dathomir that Maul has the darksaber on display there. Dathomir is also the place where Maul tells Qi'ra he is located. So I guess my question is why did Maul light up the inquisitor lightaber instead of igniting the darksaber, which is an ancient artifact and symbol of power? ",StarWars,True,1527900524,2018-06-01
Hated last jedi but loved solo,"I don't want to rehash the last jedi but for me it was one big steaming pile of bantha poodoo. Visually impressive but devoid of a good story and likable characters. Finn and Poe literally get the entire resistance killed...I just can't root or care about characters this incompetent. Last jedi lovers, I read your arguments before and respect the fact you liked it but respect the fact that I didn't. 

My real point is that after telling myself I was done with Star Wars, I seen articles saying the poor box office for Solo was evidence that Rian Johnson had it right in his approach. I don't know about others but I was personally boycotting star wars because of Rian Johnson so I ended up seeing Solo last night and I loved it. I have also realised I much prefer the star wars story films over the new trilogy, as rogue one was another great Star Wars film and much better than force awakens. I respect what Ron Howard was doing and unlike Johnson who was tearing down the franchise's relationship to other star wars films and shows, Howard tried to connect them with links to not only the movies but the TV shows too. That should be commended in my opinion. 

Anyway if there are other fans like me who hated last jedi, I encourage you to give it a go. Solo was a refreshing change for me and while not perfect is definitely a worthy addition to Star Wars and I plan on seeing it again. ",StarWars,True,1527900561,2018-06-01

This immediately made me think back to when Vader turns against Palps and saves Luke. Similar situations between the two, that being Kylo and Vader, but Kylo is the one that proved strong enough to resist the light.

Just thought this was a cool parallel that added a little more depth to Kylo's character. Obviously the situations are a little bit different, but I think it proves how emotionally damaged Kylo is from his parents and Luke. I mean, he was obviously tempted multiple times AND had to face his dad in person... Not only did he resist to turn, he straight killed the dude.

Boba fett shouldnt have died the way he did. Phasma has gotten like 3 minutes of screen time these past 2 movies and she’s been made to look like a idiot incapable of doing anything.

In conclusion, i just wanna see Kylo and his army win in the end because i feel it would be a more ”epic” ending to the trilogy

Is there any hope for episode 9?,"I enjoyed TLJ, it was very entertaining but sadly at the cost of story and plot. Now, since this new trilogy is so fragmented and isn't a coherent trilogy do you think there's hope for episode 9?

I highly doubt it and I don't really care what happens. I don't mind JJ Abrams, but the odds are stacked against him.

Also I don't care if it's a box office success, I'm not a shareholder, I care if the movie is a good movie with a storyline and some morality incorporated into it.",StarWars,True,1527936893,2018-06-02

"Parts of ""Solo"" that are probably from the Lord &amp; Miller version","We know most of ""Solo"" was reshot, but not all of it. Since I've seen the movie twice now, I've been thinking about which parts could have originated in the original Lord &amp; Miller cut and were left in the final film. There are some parts of the movie that stand out to me as having more of a self-parody comedy feel, or that maybe were originally supposed to have that kind of feel before having it de-emphasised by the editing and music:

* L3's ""I can't perform if you're looking at me"" bit.
* Lando having a dedicated cape closet.
* Later on, Lando freaking out about Qi'ra using his cape to put out a fire.
* Beckett: ""I really hurt my thumbs!""

Anyone else think Dave Feloni would be the perfect person to be in charge of Star Wars?,"If there was a person I wish was in 100% in charge of all creative aspects of Star Wars, with final say in script, directors and creative direction of the Star Wars franchise. 

What are your thoughts on this?

I know lot of people want Kathleen Kennedy gone but this is something that will probably not happen as there is no denying even with Solo flop she has made a lot of money, I think we need to be a bit realistic of what is actually possible and not just a good compromise with Fans and Disney but ultimately a great business direction which would not only make Disney more money allowing for more films but also making a larger percentage of the fan base happy.

I think Dave Feloni with 100% control of creative aspects of Star Wars and Kathleen Kennedy be in the background only handling business aspect of things. I think she should not be in public relations aspect of things not directly in interviews in relation to the direction of Star Wars.

We need someone like Dave Feloni being the face of Star Wars dealing with the public. He needs to have final say over Kathleen Kennedy on all decisions Star Wars related she just sticks to business and publishing. this will not work if Kathleen Kennedy is the final voice in the background.

For heaven sakes no more political anything and when main stream wants to add Politics to Star Wars, Dave Feloni and fans should corse correct and disassociate Star Wars from politics.

Kathleen is good at making money but she should not be in charge of Creative aspects of Star Wars and she definitely should not be a spokes person. She should stick to what she does best make money. 

I think this would be a perfect combination that could really satisfy older fans , newer fans and the general public as well as the shareholders interests.

Dave Feloni would be perfect person that could bring Star Wars to where we need to be both creatively and publicly. Kathleen Kennedy to ensure that it makes good money. For this to work tho Dave Feloni needs to have final decision when it comes to Star Wars with Kathleen assisting on the business side of things.

[Solo Spoilers] Such a missed opportunity,I really wish they hadn’t used Maul like that in Rebels now. With Kenobi coming up it would have been so cool for Maul to be the antagonist hunting him down. It’s the most epic and exciting story they could pull off in the confines of his exile and staying off the radar.

I want Dark Side-focused films. Thoughts? Suggestions? Ideas?,"I'm a huge fan of most\-everything in the Star Wars universe, whether ""Legends"" or canon, but I've been deathly curious as to the Dark Side's processes and everything that goes into that side of The Galaxy.  We spent the entirety of nine Episodes, almost all games, and the majority of literature \(with notable exceptions, like ""Darth Plagueis,"" the Maul series, ""Lords of the Sith""\) talking about the Jedi, everyday Star Wars life, scoundrels, and the Republic \(with a sprinkle of Bounty Hunting, the Empire, and a few Sith perspectives here and there\), but I'd really like to *see*\-see things from the view of the Sith and their Dark counterparts \(A/K/A cinema\). Any time period works \-\- although, I would prefer Republic/Empire times \-\- but I would love to watch some R\-rated films of Dark Side paths.

Sheev, our beloved Emperor, is probably my favorite character, because of the backstory attributed to his fall to the Dark Side and his subsequent rise to power. I could spend hours watching him. My favorite Clone Wars episode is probably the one where he senses Maul and Savage and goes to Mandalore to face them under his guise of Darth Sidious; we get so few literal views of these cools scenes of what it's really like for the Sith Lords, when they're at\-work, and only catch quick looks at what exactly they're up to from the perspective of the Light and its interaction with them.

Also, Kylo, as another example, for new\-arc fans, could be a great character to delve\-into with his actions, from his perspective \(especially during his re\-training\), under Snoke \-\- who we know isn't technically a Sith and ""knows the truth of the Force,"" but, for all intents and purposes, seems to adhere primarily to the Dark. There's so much that could be built\-on for these ""pseudo\-Sith""/Dark Side\-""fringe"" users.

Why Is No One Talking About This? Re: Solo,"So, a question going into this film was, will it be about Han being Han, or Han becoming Han?

Well, they made him really *good* in this movie: nice, helpful, romantic. So watching it, I'm thinking, okay, he's gonna become cynical by the end.

But, inexplicably, Han Solo takes the hyperfuel and instead of delivering it for the cash he could use to buy the ship he always wanted to fly his girl away, his motivation the entire film, gives it away to some other people because he finds out they're good guys, and marches into the murderous bad guy's office to tell him this.

When the proto-rebellion girl says he could join them, he declines, but why? Based on what he just did, there's no reason for him not to join their rebellion since all he suddenly cares about is doing the right thing.

It's almost like it's an origin story of Han joining the rebellion but then he doesn't cause that can't happen yet. It's showing us hey, he was always a hero, he was never really a scoundrel! And let's tie it into the OT once again by showing that hey, look! Han actually *funded* the start of the rebellion that he later joins, isn't that neat?

Is anyone else more excited for the anthology films than the main episodes? [spoilers],"I just feel like, thanks to Solo, we have so many options for awesome plots and character development. 

We heard that Beckett killed Aurra Sing. What if for the new Boba Fett movie, we see that happen? Maybe she turns against Boba and Beckett steps in? Or maybe we see Fett duel Cad Bane, giving Fett the unique dent in his helmet?

What if the driving plot of the movie is Qi'ra hiring Fett to find Solo? Or what if she is ordered by Maul to find Kenobi, leading into the next standalone Kenobi film?

My point is, thanks to Solo, many options have been opened for grander anthology films. Sure, it may have performed poorly at the box office, but it's still an amazing movie. Especially since it introduced such incredible ideas and plot elements for future adventures.

My only major problem with the movie was L3, but based on the way the other characters act when she talks, I think she was meant to be annoying.

I think what I liked most about Solo is that it felt *honest.* Like, even though it's not a perfect film by any means, it feels like a movie that asks to be judged in its entirety, both positives and negatives, unlike TFA or TLJ which seemed to people would only notice the positives and ignore the negatives.

That's why I'm really depressed that Solo is doing so poorly in the box office.

Why Solo Crashed Not Being Explained,"I've been following a lot of the articles about Solo flopping at the Box Office, and literally not a single article addresses the fact that the Last Jedi really ticked off a lot of the hardcore fans who would be the ones to go see the movie.

Personally I did see Solo on Memorial Day, and thought the movie itself was pretty good. But I only even went cause a friend invited me, I'd planned on just watching it at home once it came out (first time I would have done it for a Star Wars movie that I was alive for). And that was 100% to show my dissatisfaction for the Last Jedi.

What do you folks think? Everything I'm reading is ""too much Star Wars"" or ""competition from Marvel"" or ""too much drama around the film"". And as the type of person who you have to really screw up Star Wars to not make me watch it (I have easily over a hundred EU books at home), my answer to each of those is: no such thing, why would that make me not watch Star Wars, and I had legitimately forgotten about the drama until it got dragged out as a reason for it flopping.

Rebels and the Malachor V scurge,"I'm not quite sure, how the re-introduction of Malachor V via Rebels works for the new Disney canon. I mean, if Malachor happened and the Mandalorian Wars happened and gravity is all fucked up on the planet, why are there Jedi and Sith corpses en masse, but seemingly Mandalorians aren't mentioned.
How does KotoR 2 play into the canon lore? I mean if everything from the two games is canon, then Vader, Leia, Obi Wan, Luke etc should all be wounds in the Force by now. Anakin and Obi Wan went through war, possibly commiting or being exposed to numerous atrocities, while Leia saw her home planet be destroyed and Luke blew up an entire space station's worth of people.

How do you square the lore of a game that uses  the principal mystical energy and plot convenience of the universe to create a metaphor about the horrific nature of war and how it breaks people and poisons lives and worlds and how those that abuse it can be the end of all living things themselves?
Like, isn't Alderaan an even worse event than Malachor V? Can Leia not turn into an Exile-like figure because she never received training?
Does Vader posses the power to absorb the life-force of force-sensitives, but he doesn't realize it, because the knowledge of the technique was lost to time?

what I'm saying, basically, is, how do you square one of Obisidian's finest works of writing with the canon of the child-friendly, accessible pop science fantasy franchise that is now being used by Disney as a neverending cash cow?",StarWars,True,1527975326,2018-06-02

Using BO#'s I think TLJ lost about 40% of the audience for SW,"Quality aside (I happen to like TLJ and have been less of a fan of things after) TLJ has affected the franchise and fandom. I'll get right to the numbers.

I like patterns, so I have a hobby of reading and graphing box office results. I noticed some interesting comparisons between the Disney releases.

Solo opened with 62% less than TLJ (84m v 220M) but it's supposed to open lower so the 62% drop isn't all TLJ fault.

We need to know how much it should have opened with and we can get that by comparing TFA to R1. R1 opened with 37% less than TFA (155m v 248).

This is where it gets interesting, 37% less than TLJ (220) is 139m. Solo was projected to gross 130-170m.

Solo actually came in 40% below this number that was right in the projected range (84m actual v 139m projected)

Solo's opening compared to R1 is down 46% (84m v 155m)

How does this connect to TLJ? Well there is one more extremely interesting comparison: After opening weekend TLJ's run was down 42% from TFA run after its opening weekend. 

So to recap:

**Solo opened 40% below expectations**

**Solo opened 46% below R1**

**TLJ brought in 42% less than TFA after opening weekend**

It doesn't mean people don't have other reasons for not seeing Solo or that this portion is gone for good, but I see a strong correlation in the tickets TLJ lost to the tickets Solo is under performing R1 and expectations by.",StarWars,True,1527977206,2018-06-02

The scene from Solo that I loved and wished more people talked about.,"I just got out from my first viewing of Solo, and I thought it was a great movie. I walked in with somewhat low expectations, and I thought the movie would be a lighthearted flick with lots of charm. What I wasn’t expecting was the brutal depiction of war during the beginning moments of the movie. The scene I’m talking about occurs right after Han joins the Imperial Navy; we cut to him in battle with the Empire 3 years later. 

And it’s fucking amazing.

The sky is orange with fire and explosions. Ash-covered stormtroopers mow down oncoming natives and AT-ST’s jump down from cruisers, taking the frontlines. Terrifying war cries like “MY LEG” echo across the constant laser fire and explosions. 

THIS is the Star Wars I always wanted. This type of war and almost hellish reality only existed in the concept art or the Expanded Universe. Not even games like Battlefront could match the sheer intensity of this scene. I was left in awe as the movie cut to the trenches behind the frontlines.

I don’t know if I’m obsessing over this short minute of the movie a little too much, but it was the most memorable part of the film to me. I left the theater satisfied with the movie, but I also left wanting more of that pure chaotic action. Do any of you agree?

Solo vs. Canto Bight,"Innocent question here, all... 

Why is Solo hailed as a fun film for the story it tells and the Canto Bight segment in TLJ is hated by the same people??? 

If you pull apart everything that happens in Canto Bight, it really is meant to be a fun adventure. It’s a “making things up as we go” adventure just in the same vein as Solo is billed as a fun adventure film. 

I find it’s ignorant to praise Solo for being fun and to hate Canto Bight for being a fun side trip. People criticize it by asking what the point of it was while I ask the same thing about Solo.

Escape pods?( possible spoilers for Solo),"So in The Last Jedi Rey uses what looks to be an escape pod( a coffin like vessel) to leave the Millennium Falcon to get aboard Snoke's flagship. Then in Solo they ( Han and crew) eject an escape pod into the heart of the Maelstrom to excape the monster. If the Millennium Falcon is designed to have the Escape pod at forward most bow of the ship, then why does Rey hop into an escape pod and is shot out of the aft starboard side of the falcon. I know this is a minor thing in the scheme of Star Wars. But this contradiction within The Last Jedi and Solo is just lazy. It's not like these two films were put out in different decades, they came out 6 months apart. They didn't even take the time to think over their own plot devices for continuity. Lucas Films has millions of dollars throw at these films, and has a team devoted to story building ( Lucas story group). And I know a lot of people will respond that they wanted to redesign the Millennium Falcon in order to sell more toys. I know there is no perfect Star Wars movie in the franchise ,but take your time write a good story make sure it fits in universe and stop trying to make a money grab. Lucas films and Disney would be way more effective at making  money if they just cared about their artistic ventures. Those are my two cents.",StarWars,True,1527993062,2018-06-02

Solo is my favourite Star Wars movie. Try to change my mind.,"I am 19, and have always been a diehard Star Wars fan. I had low expectations for this movie, as I really didn’t like Rogue One or The Last Jedi. But boy was I wrong! I honestly loved everything about this movie. 

- actors: Alden Ehrenreich killed it as Han. I think he really captured the character. Woody Harrelson was great as always, and Emilia Clarke was a charming yet badass character. The same for me cannot be said about the originals or prequels. I honestly think Mark Hamill was not a good choice for Luke, and well, Hayden Christensen was just awful, as most of us can agree on. Donald Glover was awesome as Lando. So charming and charismatic, just as Lando should be. Paul Bettany played a good, creepy villain who wasn’t too ridiculously evil. I really loved the cast. Especially impressed with Alden Ehrenreich as I hadn’t even heard of him before they announced him as Han a while back. 

- plot: easy to follow, simple, and exciting. Just one main point: get the coaxium to Crimson Dawn. The plot of the main cannon films is always more confusing. No stupid reveals like Han was Qui Gon’s great nephew or something. Although the Maul reveal was clearly a fan-service and for me added nothing to the movie. There were no stupid moments to ruin a build up (like Rose saving Finn in TLJ). 

- filmography: the action sequences for me were great. I loved the scene when they were loading the Coaxium on to the Millenium Falcon, and Lando goes back to save L3, then Chewy decided to leave the Wookie and stay with Han. I also loved Lando’s introductory scene. Gambling with all the weird aliens and droids really gave it the feel of an original Star Wars movie. This is something the sequels lack. They don’t have any quirky scenes like that. 

All in all, I absolutely loved it. I’ve seen it twice and plan to see it again soon.

The Clone Wars was mostly fought between enslaved armies.,"So, Solo acknowledged that droids are basically slaves in the Star Wars universe. Droids are sentient, they have developed personalities, and have demonstrated fear. And yet, the characters routinely buy and sell them, force them to do jobs they are unable or unwilling to do, and threaten to shut them down or worse if they don't comply. They also routinely wipe their memories. This reading goes all the way back to A New Hope, where Luke is prepared to fit Artoo and Threepio with restraining bolts so that they can't run away, shortly after purchasing them at a public auction. Earlier in the movie, Threepio is concerned that if they disobey a direct order, they might be sent to work in the spice mines of Kessel. During the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation owned and manufactured an entire army of droids, forcing them onto the front lines to be slaughtered. 

The Jedi never seems especially concerned with this - perhaps because they themselves are commanding an army of forced conscripts. The clones were purchased by a Jedi, with all the payment going to the cloners and the bounty hunter used as a basis for the clones. The clones themselves do not appear compensated for their service. The clones themselves are indoctrinated from birth to serve the Republic's ideals, are forced to go into battle, and have secretly have chips implanted in their brain to compel them to follow certain orders. The clones never complain about this because, as I said, they have been thoroughly indoctrinated. 

So what we essentially have are two enslaved armies slaughtering each other, under the command of hopelessly corrupt governments, with next to no objection from the Jedi or any of our other heroes. There was an entire animated series on Cartoon Network about this conflict.

The Protest Against Star Wars and its End,"We all know that for the past six months, the internet has been in a fury over Star Wars because of the reception to The Last Jedi. We've seen hundreds (or thousands) of videos criticizing The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy, or some combination of the three. With Solo, we've seen the introduction of an age-old technique of criticism - boycott. Of course, this is a perfectly legitimate form of protest - the American colonists, for one, used it to great effect. All of these forms of protest and criticism lead to a few key points that those behind them want to see - a reshuffling of Lucasfilm, involving firing and replacing both Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson from their current positions, the release of fan-wanted films like Kenobi and KOTOR, as well as removing the exclusive license for video games from EA.

However, what is the end here? The Last Jedi is here to stay - it won't be decanonized, and there won't be a new Episode VIII to replace it. Even if KK and RJ are gone, TLJ will survive. Does that mean the protest goes on? After all, the original point was about TLJ. Even if all of these points are met, is there any guarantee the protest will end? A lot of these YouTube channels that post content against TLJ, KK, and RJ are thriving right now, and I can't see them simply disappearing with a ""we're done"" attitude if the reshuffling happens. There's no saying that the goalposts won't simply be moved to a further arbitrary point.

I think a can of worms has been opened. I'm not even sure what Lucasfilm and Disney even needs to do to try and attempt closing it. What do you all think?",StarWars,True,1527998201,2018-06-02

Of course he will have to jump through hoops such as the deaths of Luke and Snoke, but these characters are bound to have a presence in this film.

I think the magic might be gone.,"This probably isn't the right sub to say this but I don't know where else to share it. Solo will be the first Star Wars film I don't see the premiere of voluntarily. This weekend instead my friends and I will be seeing Infinity Wars some of us for the second time instead. We're all in our 30's and even though Star Wars is a huge part of our friendship none of us feel the need to see this film. And earlier today another friend in Corpus Christi tells me he just bought his IMAX theater tickets for Solo and the theater is practically empty Thursday night and Friday the entire theater is empty. I checked some other theaters I normally go to and it's the same thing there as well. 

Is now the time we can admit there's a problem? Can well come together and say even if we like the current stuff somethings gotta change?",StarWars,True,1527011714,2018-05-22

How I view Star Wars Canon (Updated),"Ever since Disney re-branded the old Star Wars expanded universe as Legends and started a new continuity, there's been a lot of debate on how to approach ""Canon."" When people say Canon, they usually mean what did or didn't happen in Star Wars, or what counts and what doesn't count. So after considering my own opinion and hearing what other people think, here's how I've come to view Star Wars continuity:

1) To me, Absolute Canon will always be Star Wars Episodes I thru VI and The Clone Wars TV series and movie. This isn't because of quality or preference, but because these are the cinematic works that George Lucas was directly involved in. They also form the foundation of both Disney Canon and Legends.
2) I see Disney Canon and Legends as two separate Star Wars continuities, and the only things they have in common are Episodes I thru VI and TCW. You can think of it like a Venn Diagram, with Legends on one side, Disney Canon on the other, and George Lucas's works in the middle.
3) With all this in mind, I see the overall Star Wars continuity as something like this:
        -Top Tier (George Lucas Canon): Outranks everything else.
        -Middle Tier (Disney Canon): Everything here can be 
         considered canon unless a story contradicts something 
         in the top tier.
        -Bottom Tier (Legends): Even though nothing here can be 
        considered canon, a lot of these stories could reasonably be 
        assumed to have happened when they don't interfere with 
        official canon.

So that's how I view Star Wars canon (though this may be exactly what Disney intended based on their original announcement, and maybe I'm way overthinking this). 

Do you agree or disagree? How do you approach Canon and continuity in Star Wars? Let me know what you think down below.

The main reason why I don't think Ben Solo's redemption is necessary.,"Anakin had a reason to be redeemed.  He was once a hero.  And he only turned to the dark side because he thought it would grant him the power to save his loved ones.  Misguided?  For sure.  But it's noble in twisted sense.  

Ben has never presented as a fallen hero (like Vader was).  He was a boy who flirted with the dark side (per Han and Leia's conversation in TFA), and then eventually gave into as he was training to become a Jedi (per TLJ).  

Unless they want to present us with new information in IX, Ben turned to the dark side simply because he wanted power for power's sake.  He liked the idea of being the new Vader.  It gave him a sense of purpose in the post-PT and post-OT galaxy.  

All we know about him is that he considers the OT heroes (especially Luke and Han) to be weak and stupid.  This isn't a character who is simply misguided (like Vader was).  This is a character who actively thinks being a hero is worthless.

So I don't see why it's necessary to randomly turn him into a good guy in IX.  He's not interested in being a hero.  Why should he change his mind?  He wants to rule the galaxy.  ",StarWars,True,1527016824,2018-05-22
What's up with the hyperbole in this fanbase?,"Maybe it's just the part of the community I engage with most often, but it seems like a lot of fans blow literally everything regarding Star Wars way out of proportion. A prime example is the reaction to the new Disney films. It seems like if even one of them is not to a person's taste they need to start a revolution, and boycott all future films. 

People are already planning on boycotting Solo, and I just don't understand it. I personally have no interest in that movie, but I can't seem to understand fans acting like it's existence means the franchise is knocking on death's door. Why can't people just chill out when it comes to Star Wars? I understand it means a lot to people, but they're still only movies. ",StarWars,True,1527017091,2018-05-22

First off, IMO, it's not that diverse, but, that's besides the point, I'm not taking about the film, just the reaction.

The most annoying by far to me is acting as though saying Rey advanced too quickly or is a Mary Sue is sexist, like, it's getting tired, hearing people act as though Anakin and luke' s training arc was like hers, they aren't, bottom line, both of those characters had to train a lot to get where they are, Rey didn't, it's not sexist pointing that out.

And, no, having force enhanced vision to get a lucky shot isn't equal to defeating a trained darksider and using a mind trick a day after you learned the force was a thing.

The Correlation between those who don't want the Han Solo movie and those who are begging for an Obi-Wan film,"This is a survey I would love to do in greater detail one day.

Browsing about twitter, reddit, Facebook and other sites, it is interesting to see the two common types of comments.

""Nobody wanted a Han Solo Movie!""

Then usually followed by:

""Give fans what they want Disney, give us an Obi-Wan Movie with Ewan McGregor!""

Obviously we can't all like the same things but seeing this two comments, sometimes back-to-back highlights a strange issue.

Yes, I can see why people would want an Obi-Wan film over a Han Solo film. You have a character played by an actor that a majority enjoyed despite the reception of the PT as a whole.

But this highlights a weird issue in this idea of ""Want"" and ""Asking"" I find and ultimately feels backwards.",StarWars,True,1527031091,2018-05-22

The Force Awakens,"Prior to getting into the post I would like to thank the people who commented on my post about ESB the other day. I watched it second time and I enjoyed it a lot more. Actually it is my favourite SW film alongside ROTS.

Today, I sat down and watched TFA for like the 10th time since its release. I hand it watched it quite a while and I have to say I am disappointed. It didn’t feel like SW to me like Rogue one or the the first 6 films. It is pretty unoriginal and feels it doesn’t have its own personality. I am surprised to hear people say the characters are great because aside Han, Chewie and Kylo, I feel the others (even Leia) are quite uninteresting. 

The plot is quite similar to ANH and it sort of feels that nothing has changed since OT. The Empire (First Order) is back in town, stronger than ever and the good guys are once again the underdogs. I have to admit it is my least favourite film out of the 9.

Not much to say about the film, my only issue was the character of L3 who was just irritating, and the fact that (much like all these new Disney movies) there was no reason for this film to be made other than money.

There are quite a few “hey remember this? well it’s this again!” moments, but not as much as in the other 3. Easily the best of the new films, and worth a rewatch or two for the pros outweigh the cons - but it never reaches beyond the scope of an enjoyable blockbuster and for me, Star Wars has always felt like more, however this is a problem shared with all 4 new films.

Solo; Cowboy or Pirate,"Reddit Friends,

I am after some assistance in settling a debate around the Character of Han Solo.

I whole heartedly believe Han Solo is a cowboy. Not just in appearance and behaviour. But also cienmatically as well. 

Just one cursery glance at the Solo trailer presents us with a number of different shots that are iconic to western films (and my association, Cowboys). Not to mention the many western inspired screen wipes through out the franchise. 

Now this colleague believes that Solo is a pirate, his evidence for this. He's a smuggler.  I have tried to point point out that Cowboys (not the actual profession, but the western outlaw sense of the word) also smuggled and did drug runs etc so it was unique to piracy.

I was wondering, Ney hoping, for some constructive debate or argument towards why he is a Cowboy. Or. A pirate.",StarWars,True,1527061163,2018-05-23

How would this make you feel towards Lukes arc in TLJ?,"Its fair to say that Lukes journey in the ST has been very divisive. Most peoples issues come from his retreat to Ach T'oo and his 'moment of weakness' at the jedi temple. For me a very simple borrowing from Legends can make this far more understandable. 

1. Luke did marry Mara Jade, and she is among those he trains at the temple. 
2. Mara is pregnant with child at the time of Ben Solos fall. 

This suddenly makes Lukes utter anguish and desire to get away all the more understandable, and at the same time makes his moment of weakness all the more understandable too if he foresees Kylo slaying not only his students, but also his own wife. 
As someone who didn't find Lukes reasons for isolating himself convincing enough, this would certainly make me feel better about it, and show Luke as more of a tragic hero than a 'coward', which is a word people have thrown around since TLJ. What do you think?",StarWars,True,1527068137,2018-05-23
About Luke in TLJ,"Something I just realized when commenting on someone else’s post:

Luke’s character in the TLJ makes perfect sense given the six prior movies. 

First, his decision to end the Jedi comes from the same conclusion that Anakin came to in Revenge of the Sith. The Jedi, despite their power, were hypocrites and failures. They walked right into Sideous trap, including attacking him or remove him from power and his justifying Order 66. Luke knows first hand how the old order acted, since he had two former council members lying to him in order to get to him to kill his own father. 

Now the way the movie seems to explain it, Luke thought that he could train Jedi without falling into the same pitfalls the old order did. But in the end, he couldn’t. The same thing happened this time as last time, a gifted student became corrupted and killed the whole order. So obviously something must be wrong with the Jedi teachings or the idea of the Jedi itself. That’s why Luke went to find the first Jedi temple, to figure out where the Jedi went wrong. Now I think the assumption is that there is something in the old Jedi texts that revealed to Luke that big temples and galactic influences are not a Jedi thing. Or at least nothing in them is a sufficient justification for those things. Therefore, Luke comes to the conclusion that the Jedi are abusing the Force and cause all the problems in the Galaxy.

Also, as for Luke even thinking to attack Ben...it actually is to totally within his character. Remember in RotJ, Vader taunting Luke with the idea of turning Leia basically turned Luke from “i don’t want to kill you” to having murderous rage. It was only after disarming Vader did Luke realize what he was doing. 

I think it’s reasonable for Luke, even after the years that passed, to become afraid when in Ben he sensed a darkness that was probably very similar to Vader. Maybe it was even reactive for Luke.

Just watched Solo. Need help,"On its own, Solo was great. I went in pretending not to know who the characters are, and while that’s quite impossible, it helped me enjoy the movie as....a solo movie. How it places itself in the overarching mythos, well, I dunno...I’m quite confused tbh.

From what I understand, every movie after the OT is intended to enhance its story or provide some information that brings depth to the characters.

* the PT explored what happened to the Clone Wars and the rise and fall of Anakin
* R1 explained the “plothole” regarding the Death Star’s convenient weakness
* the ST of course continues the story and begins a new one, while also exploring the nature of the Force

I consider all of them important, that these stories needed to be told. Even R1, though not really needed, tidied up things neatly.

Can someone who has watched Solo explain why the movie is important/needed? It’s interesting to see how Han met Chewie, won the Falcon from Lando, and did the Kessel Run, but they didn’t really seem integral to the main story. Am I missing some dialogue or scene that was important? Should I  be shocked when Enfys Nest revealed herself? What are the implications of bringing Maul into the picture once more?

I really wanted to enjoy the movie but I’m really confused.",StarWars,True,1527083793,2018-05-23
ANH:Are there deleted scenes with Threepio and Artoo before and after Luke sells the Landspeeder?,"I was watching the 1990 VHS release of the film for the first time in years and I noticed the editing before and after the Han/Greedo scene becomes noticeably disjointed. 

The first happens with Luke and Ben walking out of the Catina, Ben tells Luke he has to sell the speeder and there's a brief but clear shot of Threepio looking at them as they pass but they ignore him. 

Then there's the Han shot first scene 

Then there's another awkward cut to Threepio and Artoo hiding behind a door from Sandtroopers and Threepio says he wish he went with Luke 

Then Luke sells the speeder, you see Long Snoot/Garindan following them 

Then there's another abrupt transition with Threepio and Artoo suddenly with Luke and Ben, Garindan is still following them. 

I know about the deleted scenes with Jabba but it seems like a few scenes were removed from this segment but I can't find any details on them.

"[no spoilers] Purgils, Hyper matter, and Hyperspace. What Solo tells us about how hyperspace works","So many of us here most likely grew up with the Legends explanation of how the universe got hyperspace tech and how it worked. To rehash, the Rakata spread their tech and slaves and when they died out the people reverse engineered it to create Hyperspace canons then ships to explore. And Hyper drives worked on Hypermater reactors that allowed a whole to be punched into another dimension called Hyperspace. Though we never really knew where they got hypermatter or how.

The Solo offical guide book gives us some answers on the questions we've had ever since Rebels told us that Purgills (flying space whales capable of hyperspace) taught the ancient explores how to transverse the stars.

We start of with something called Coaxium. Coaxium is a form of Hypermatter that bridges the dimension of hyperspace and realspace. A thin coating of coaxium lines a ships hyperdrive reaction chamber.

So how do the purgils fit into this? Ancient space explorers found traces of Coaxium in its natural form as well as another gas called Clouzan-36 in the stomachs of Purgils. The creatures metabolize these things to form hypermatter and use it to travel though space.

So where does coaxium come from? Well apparently from planets that are found in turbulent areas of space where their is an increased stellar stress on the planet (gravity and radiation I would assume). Kessel is a good example of this due to its location to the Maw.

Also their is a map to the queen of Ranroon in the treasure vault and a skull from Xim the Despots hoard.

Dumb Question Regarding Morality and Sides in Star Wars,"For a long time, I've always questioned the morality within the Star Wars universe. The Light, the Dark - I know it's not truly black and white. The Star Wars universe is surely not as morally ambiguous as the Warhammer 40k universe with it being all *grimdark* and all - but there is a sense that there are heroes and villains on both sides.  

From the age of the Old Republic and up until now, many people claim one side is morally better than the other. Sometimes both sides fight alongside each other to face a common enemy - a bigger bad. Yet the Light Side and the Dark Side are always at conflict. Innocents are always in the middle of these conflicts. Both commit atrocities and crimes against the galaxy. Imperials with their slavery and tyrannical oppression. Rebels with their terrorism and murder. The Republic with their corruption within its bureaucratic system, along with annexation of unwilling star systems who want independence. Jedi who kidnap force sensitive children and indoctrinating them into their order. The Sith, who kill without remorse and bring even more death to the galaxy. 

Every side says they're better than the other - is there any truth to what they say?  ",StarWars,True,1527093168,2018-05-23

People Who Say 'Solo' Isn't a Necessary Movie are NOT Allowed to Ask for an 'Obi-Wan' Film,[removed],StarWars,True,1527096182,2018-05-23
Solo was a perfectly fine Star Wars film,"Nothing amazing or anything that adds a hell of a lot to the Star Wars series, but it was fun, and after the heaviness of The Last Jedi, whether you're in the Pro or Con group for that film, it was really the kind of film I wanted to see in SW. Its a film that really is a return to the serial adventure type of film that A New Hope was.  In many ways its more like the OT than the other new SW movies.

Alden Ehrenreich was fine. I never really saw him as the old Han, but thats mostly because nobody can really live up to Harrison Ford in his prime more than any problem with Alden. But thats OK, because this isnt that character or an imitation of it, its a much younger version and its not at all hard to imagine that this character could become the Han we know. He nailed the body language and mannerisms. Some of the lines and the way he delivered it would make you go ""Ok, now thats Han"".   

The real highlight of the film was the Han and Chewbacca relationship. After seeing them as buddies for 40 years of movies it was a lot of fun to see how they met and how their relationship formed. It was also great to see Chewy kicking ass in a way we've never seen before.  

As practically every review has mentioned, Donald Glover was a scene stealer as Lando. And he really was. He's everything anyone could want from a young Lando.  

There was a ton of easter eggs and references only real fans will pick up on, quite a few of them taken from EU sources like games and things, things that havent been mentioned in any of the movies before but have been in other SW media.  

  
I did have some issues. The movie is really dark, visually. The entire movie looks dark and muddy. Interior scenes are always dimly lit and hazy, and the exterior scenes always seem to be set at dusk. Sometimes it works and adds atmosphere, but it got a bit too much.  Also some of the action/effects scenes go on way too long. I dont know what it is with modern blockbusters but they seriously need to get their acts together when editing action scenes. 

In the end, I was worried about this film ever since it was announced that it would ruin the characters we know or otherwise affect the series negatively. But I neednt have worried, its just a fun ride filling in some background that we didnt need but didnt do any harm and some of which Im really glad to have seen. I think I'd give it a 7.5/10 ",StarWars,True,1527097098,2018-05-23

I’m wondering how much YOU think Lucasfilm should worry from both a financial and creative standpoint about this issue.

I just watched Solo (No spoilers),"Totally exceeded my expectations, although I must admit I wasn't expecting too much. IMO really similar quality compared to Rogue One, but definitely way better than the Last Jedi. Casting  Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo was not a mistake, he really felt like younger Han throughout the entire movie. The amount/intensity of jokes was  really just like in Rogue One, and I like that. It wasn't too filled with them and when there was a joke, it felt like a Star Wars kind of joke. The movie had no boring parts \(unlike The Last Jedi¨\), it just kept going until the end. And I imagine you guys will also be happy to hear that there wasn't really any SJW stuff, or at least I didn't mind/notice it. ""Solo:  A Star Wars Story"" gave us a solid background for Han Solo \(and some other characters, too\), it didn't contradict with what we were told in the originals, and I think I'll definitely buy this one on Blu\-Ray once it comes out :\)

My stab at the bomber argument from TLJ for anyone interested.,"First off. If this is something that's already been put through the grinder on this board, sorry for being late to the party. I hear a lot of people complaining that the bombs being dropped on the FO ship, in TLJ, wouldn't keep dropping in open space. I think they would. Here's my argument. The ship they drop from has artificial gravity. This is what enables them to fall in the first place. Once they enter open space, gravity is not there to influence the bombs. The momentum they gained from falling out of the ship still influences them. They are not being pulled, but pushed by their own momentum towards the ship. Well. That's it.

Why is Ethan Van Sciver so obsessed with Solo?,"Guy in question, if you don't know him, is a DC comics penciller. One of the spearheading attackers during the ComicsGate, possibly (although he denies) linked to the far-right movements.

Has also clashed on twitter with Pablo Hidalgo himself, who was understandably pissed off by his constant toxicity and boycotting of the (then upcoming) Solo movie.

Can we take a moment to appreciate the beautiful world-building in Star Wars?,"I just finished watching through all of the movies to get ready for Solo (I know I didn't need to, but I wanted an excuse to watch them all). 

Starting with the prequels, places like Naboo and Coruscant felt so real and alive. Then, O.T places like Endor or Hoth were so vivid and I felt like I just wanted to explore them when I first watch the films.

Even newly established places, like the barren and arid Jakku, the beautiful Scarif, or the surreal Crait. 

If there's one thing they do well, it's world-building. Sure, some places may not feel as fleshed out as others, but man...theres no other film franchise (except maybe LOTR) where I want to visit it so much.

Secondly,you could carry out to identify from the aspect of the texture whether it is real hair or not.Real [brazillian virgin human hair](https://easyvirginhair.com/collections/brazillian-virgin-hair/products/ishow-brazilian-curly-human-hair-weave-4-bundles?variant=4472991055883) will not be extremely straight or silky.generally,it is coarser,fake [virgin hair](https://easyvirginhair.com/collections/brazillian-virgin-hair/products/ishow-brazilian-virgin-hair-straight-human-hair-weave-4-pcs-lot?variant=4473006096395) has gone through other influences,such as silicone treatment and chemical straightener coating,which make the virgin hair silky and straight.But if running you finger through the hair,a good way you could get a feeling of the coating.

Another way is the flame test.Cut off a small sample of the hair and place them above a candle.Real virgin hair usually produce smoke when it touch a flame.While fake virgin hair like synthetic hair will flame quickly with a big flame when it contacts with a lighter.You easily identify the difference between the real virgin human hair and fake virgin human hair.

What’s more,virgin hair will retain its wave pattern or natural curl even if it is wet.while fake virgin hair make you feel heavy when it becomes wet.

Choosing real Virgin Brazilian Hair is quite importance ,because pure virgin human hair will not hurt your original hair and if you take care of the virgin hair well,it could last and serve you for a long time.So we should correctly identify the real virgin human hair.",StarWars,True,1527130447,2018-05-23

So my question is, are there any specific releases of the OT that can provide something resembling the theatrical cut of the film? I was looking at this release in particular, but wasn't too sure since it was released around the same time as the box set I already have.

Anyway, I hope this question isn't too complex or silly, and hopefully someone is able to help me out here. Thanks!",StarWars,True,1527145152,2018-05-24
It actually does make a lot of sense that Holdo kept her ultimate plan a secret to Poe,"I think it’s safe to assume that a few close people in Holdo’s orbit that she trusted knew about her ultimate intentions to abandon the ship and sacrifice herself by using lightspeed as a weapon, but telling that plan to Leia or Poe risked her not being successful in her mind.

The courageous Leia wouldn’t have let a subordinate sacrifice herself. She probably would want to do it herself instead. Holdo thought Leia - not herself - was a better leader to the Resistance if they escaped and did not want to risk any martyrdom on Leila’s part. They also had a close friendship and such a friendship would have jeopardized the entire plan with a power struggle.

She didn’t tell Poe because she was afraid his recklessness would have jeopardized her plan from the start. You could argue it could have been easier to just tell him, but if she was already in control it wouldn’t have mattered. She knew enough of her command would have subdued Poe if need be.",StarWars,True,1527145166,2018-05-24

Rebel Scum: A Study of Finn,"I feel like a lot of people don't appreciate Finn very much, and I can see why: he's not a mythologized hero, and he never was. His arcs aren't epic and bombastic. Instead, they just boil down to the direction in which he runs. In *The Force Awakens*, Finn's defining moment was his heartbreaking sprint TOWARDS the First Order in an attempt to save the only friend he has in the galaxy. And in *The Last Jedi*, it's his resolve to die for a cause that he was still not fully on board with when the film began.

But through Finn, J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson have both explored the same question: what does a random person need to become motivated into true heroism? For Abrams, the answer was friendship. For Johnson, the answer was compassion, not just for one's friends, but for *everyone.*

And in each film, Episode VII and Episode VIII, Finn is something in one film that he is not in the other. In *The Force Awakens*, Finn is random: a lone stormtrooper anointed by blood and given a great destiny with absolutely no tools or special skills with which to do it. And in *The Last Jedi*, Finn has attained significant status, and things happen to him because of who he is: he's on Poe's official payroll, and he even has fans like Rose... who he promptly disappoints. But what he is in THAT film, which he wasn't, ironically, in *The Force Awakens*... is a real stormtrooper.

So he's aggressive. He's single-minded. He's short-sighted. His morality is binary. When he goes out and fights crime, he just wants to ""trash that town, make them hurt."" Why? Because... they're bad? That's the First Order indoctrination that so many felt was oddly lacking in VII. And he spends the entirety of VIII learning to overcome it. The Finn of VII simply replaces one organization for another: the Finn of VIII learns to ask *why*.

And this is why Finn is one of my favorite *Star Wars* characters. His growth is subtle. His lessons are resounding. You'd think he was already firmly placed in ""hero"" status by the end of Episode VII, but as Rian Johnson clearly states, heroism is not a one-and-done box to be checked off. And Finn doesn't grow into a Jedi like Rey, or a Resistance general like Poe. He just becomes a good person, and his climactic scene is of him embracing his long-lost friend.",StarWars,True,1527146424,2018-05-24

What's your perception of L3-37? (Solo spoilers),"A lot has been said about the latest addition to the main droid characters before the movie came out/after Last shot came out.

As we all know, everything tends to be polarized these days and so was the case with L3. On one hand you have peopel going nuts about the ""first female droid"" (even though we've had female droid in the saga), on the other hand tehre are those people complaining about her being what you could would call a ""progressive leftits"" or all the nicknames given to that side of the spectrum.

I was a little worried about how political they'd make her in the actual movie, but what I saw in Solo kinda surprised me.

I knew who she was from Last shot, that she cared deeply about droid liberation and all that stuff, but I was mostly surprised by the way it was portrayed on screen.

In the movie, we can see her constantly going on about droids are opressed, yelling at people and berating them to the point whe the main characters roll they eyes at her. Kinda similar to people like The big red and similar.And you can hardly argue that she's the comic relief of the movie (well, one of them).

From that, I actually got the impression that she's a sort of satire of the ""SJWs"", a way of poking fun at them. Sorta like what Deadpool 2 did but more subtle. 

But I can imagine that if I was one of those ""SJWs"", I'd probably symphatize with her. Thinking about it, she seems like some social commentary left to the interpretation of the viewer.

What's your opinion about her?",StarWars,True,1527158020,2018-05-24
Rian Johnson is a Sith Lord,"One of the key doctrines of the Sith is that when something is no longer of use it should be destroyed.

I should preface this by saying I think RJ's take on Luke was actually very well done barring one moment, the death of Luke Skywalker. His death served no purpose to the rest of the film, if he had actually been there to face Ben and then done an Obi Wan style death then it would have been fine. However he isn't even there and he just dies from exhaustion or something \(admittedly it is a fantastic scene\). I could maybe forgive this had RJ been the one writing the next film however he has no involvement at all so he certainly doesn't have a plan. It breaks my heart seeing how involved and excited Mark Hammil was when the sequel trilogy began, only to be killed for no apparent narrative purpose.

Luke had fulfilled his purpose in RJ's film and was destroyed.",StarWars,True,1527158056,2018-05-24

Solo was absolutely phenomenal. (No spoilers),"When I walked out of the midnight screening for TLJ, i felt disappointed, upset, and empty. I didn't feel like i'd watched a Star Wars film. I'm not hating on it, i tried so hard to like it but it just wasn't for me. It made the magic of the franchise go away for me.

Last night, i felt the complete opposite. Ho-lee fuck. Solo was absolutely phenomenal. Alden and Donald nailed the roles of Han and Lando, down to the voices and the mannerisms. The origin stories fit so well and didn't feel shoehorned in at all, and the pacing was great. It was a 2 and a half hour movie, but it felt like 40 minutes. I left the cinema feeling like i'd just seen a Star Wars film.

I do not think that people who liked or loved TLJ can answer this, at least not in a way that would make sense to those of us who did not like the film.

[Major Solo Spoilers] Final Anthology Trilogy Film Theory.,"\*\*Spoiler Warning for those who haven’t seen Solo A Star Wars Story yet.\*\*

&amp;nbsp;

Solo Movie ended quite mysteriously with Qi’Ra contacting Maul who appears to be the guy who controls Crimson Dawn. He told her to go to Dathomir for some unfinished business. Beckett also told Han to go to Tatooine because a ""big shot gangster"" was setting up a crew.

This leads me to believe that there will be a sequel or at least a continuation of the Solo Movie. Most likely it will be in the form of the final anthology movie, which Disney have been very secret about \(We hardly have any details of it, and the Obi Wan spin\-off details are mostly rumors\). Maybe because revealing information about it could have spoiled the Solo movie.

So what would it be about? Well that big shot gangster is most defiantly Jabba and I think this movie would give us an idea of how Han became a smuggler under him as well as his connections with characters like Boba Fett \(Who Han seemed to know in the ROTJ\). It would most likely feature Maul and Qi’Ra as the villains and Jabba is probably after some sort of Holocron or something which Maul wants to find as well \(I don’t know really\).

For those of you have seen Rebels could you give some insight in whether or not this would be possible because I don’t really know what happened to Maul in the last seasons. Also do you think this is plausible or is the final anthology movie going to be the Obi Wan spin\-off? Let me know in the comments.",StarWars,True,1527173796,2018-05-24

Star Wars book list.,"So I’ve read Star Wars books off and on but I’ve recently decided that I want to dive in a little deeper and begin reading more.

I started with Splinter of the Mind’s Eye. I already know the story and that’s why I chose to read it because I think it’s very interesting and unique.

"Can we all admit that most star wars movies are bad? (spoiler text is so I don't get mass down voted before you read the whole thing, there are no spoilers)","1. &gt;!People calling something you like bad doesn't mean anything. You can admit that a movie is bad and still enjoy it. The prequels \(except rots\) are bad. That doesn't stop me from enjoying them. Simple. So don't take it personally when someone calls the prequels bad or the Last Jedi bad. You can like bad movies and still admit they are bad. But if you insult the gone droid, ITS TREASON THEN!&lt;

&gt;!2. The OT was not perfect. Episode 4 was slow IMO and I think it is a little boring when I look at it objectively. Episode 6 was George's way of copying Disney's trademark ""Putting in little furry bois to sell toys"" crap. \*cough\* porgs \*cough\*!&lt;

&gt;!3. You can have diversity in Star Wars without shoehorning them in. I personally liked rogue one, and I respect those who didn't. Rogue one was a perfect example of diversity that isn't just for diversity's sake. \(Although there should've been more humanoids\)  Fin is another good example, and think him being black is kind of a metaphor. Him being black provides a contrast between him and the other stormtroopers. IDK, just something that I just thought of right now.!&lt;

&gt;!4. Rey can still be saved from her Mary Sue title. If you have played KOTOR 2 I think it was, you learn that your character is a wound in the force. BOOFIRE191 made a good video on this, and the theory makes The Last Jedi less..... terrible. The link to the video is here. !&lt;

"RJ remakes The Empire Strikes Back. PARODY. Caution, obscene language.","RJ's first draft for the The Empire Strikes Back remake.

Of course this is a **parody**.

**Episode V: The Last Sith**

Sorry for my ... err RJ's English.

While reading this, please avoid mentally picturing Mark “The Legend” Hammill, and Carrie “The Princess” Fisher, they deserve better.

**It is a stressful time for the beautiful Princess Leia Organa. Although she and her young pilots destroyed the Death Star, Imperial troops have driven her forces from their hidden base and pursued her across the galaxy.**

**Evading the sexist no\-female\-officers Imperial Starfleet, a group of warriors wisely led by master tactician senator Princess Leia have established a new secret base on the boringly desolate ice world of Hoth.**

**The evil dirty old man Vader, obsessed with finding the young celebrity Princess Leia and her Rebels, has dispatched thousands of clunky analog probes into the far reaches of space....**

* The Empire can’t find the rebels, so they pay Boba Fett to search for them.
* In the next 10 seconds Boba Fett finds Chewbacca’s Facebook, the photos of tauntaun in some snow covered plains gives away the icy planet Hoth.
* By the way, RJ’s Tauntaun are some cute pink\-fur bipedal unicorn creatures. Anyone can be saved from the freezing nights of Hoth by being pushed like a suppository into their warm cozy asses.
* Millennial Han and millennial Luke kill a tauntaun by milking her too much, millennial Leia is grossed out by them.
* By the way, RJ’s Chinese inner\-beauty Princess Leia sports trendy knitted cap, pastel hair, overalls and Doc Martens, and she is stronger than ever in every possible aspect.
* RJ’s Han Solo sports a very manly looking lumberjack beard and metrosexual tight red jeans.
* RJ’s Luke Skywalker sports a rad messy comb over fade hairdo, buddy holly big black glasses and ear tunnels.
* RJ’s Chewbacca sports a plain flannel shirt, converse sneakers and no\-pants, but the millennial guys roll eyes away from him for trying hard to be a hipster.
* Chewbacca tries to eat a cute wampa but ends befriending its family, and shares his craft beer. The wampas would eat Chewie if they weren’t too drunk.
* By the way, RJ’s wampas are some always\-hungry purple\-fur bear\-monkey creatures. Anyone can be hilariously eaten by them.
* 
* The Empire deploys assault forces in the snowy surface of Hoth.
* The Rebels make some fake snow rebel soldiers to distract the Imperial snowtroopers while they wisely escape using the backdoor. But not before Leia sends hundreds of genxers rebel soldiers to save some cute wampas from the Empire, and orders other soldiers to pick up the polluting plastic waste in Echo Base, including tons of used batteries in her alcove.
* Some silly male rebel soldiers gets hilariously eaten by the wampas.
* Hothead hotshot pilot Luke attacks the AT\-ATs by himself, but he cannot destroys anything. “Fucking archaic snowspeeder with fucking buttons, fucking levers and fucking sticks, where is the touchscreen?” says Luke.
* Luke involuntarily collides his snowspeeder against an AT\-AT, but he survives crash landing, because everyone can survive collision and crash landing.
* “Savage! That was the most epic battle ever! Will be remembered forever,” says Luke, and runs to save his ass.
* 
* Han Solo distracts the snowtroopers by prank calling to the cellphone of Vader.
* “Hello?” says Darth Vader
* “Heeeyyy! Hellooo Darth Boomer,” says Han.
* “It’s V.A.D.E.R.! Darth Fucking Vader for you, millennial fucker!” says the Sith lord.
* “So salty! It’s really a miracle your prehistoric ass learned to answer a cellphone!” says Han.
* Untranscribable angry old man gibberish by the dark lord of the Sith.
* “Here, your boys want to talk to you,” says Han.
* “Whodafuc?” asks Vader.
* “Hey! I mean…respectfully hello? Mister Vader, sir?” asks the snowtrooper.
* “Who is talking? Dammit!” says Vader.
* “Sir, it’s me, trooper a553uk3d, sir, Vader, dark lord, sir…” says the imperial soldier.
* “Whadafuc you want!?” says Vader losing it.
* “Sir, that rebel scum said you wanted to talk to us, sir,” says the snowtrooper.
* “Bring me that fucking cocksucker millennial kid!” says Darth Vader.
* “Who?” asks the soldier.
* “Fucking Han Solo and his fucking friends, bring their fucking hipster asses to me! Right now!” says Vader.
* “Err… they were gone as we talked, sir,” says the trooper.
* Untranscribable angry old man gibberish by the dark lord of the Sith.
* 
* The Imperial Star Destroyers destroy every single genxer rebel transport that try to escape from Hoth.
* 
* Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, AnDroid C3PO, and 7 wampas and 50 tauntaun get away in the Nonmillennial Falcon, but they can’t jump to hyperspace
* “What the fuck is wrong with the damn Wi\-Fi in this shitty spaceship?” asks Leia trying to upload to Twitter her latest #me2hot4u video.
* “The MS Nonmillennial Falcon runs DOS 3.3, and that OS doesn’t support Wi\-Fi hardware!” roars Chewbacca.
* “We’re so fucked up, Chewie bring those old modems by your Wookie\-sandbox, maybe some of them could be cannibalized to improvise a router,” says Han.
* “Stinks of wampa in there, MacGyver,” roars Chewbacca.
* “Move your hairy ass NOW!” says Leia, and Chewbacca goes off.
* “By the way, the hyperdrive is broken, we can’t escape the Imperial Fleet,” says Han.
* “I can’t even…” begins Leia.
* Han gets it, “…wait for me Chewie, let me help you with the wampa poop,” says while leaving without aggravating the situation.
* Darth Vader and his imperial fleet are too slow to catch the Nonmillennial Falcon, so they persevere in a thrilling\-nail\-biting slow pursue of Han, Leia, Chewbacca, AnDroid C3PO, 7 wampas and 40 tauntaun
* 
* Luke escapes Hoth with iR2D2. In his iXWING’s computer googles “Jedi master” and finds Yoda in Dagobah.
* Luke arrives to Dagobah, which has some resemblance with the Everglades for tourists, there he finds the hilariously drunk Yoda partying with transvestite ghost Kenobi and momentarily passed out Qui\-Gon.
* “Training this fucking whiny millennial kid I am not. Yeesssssss...” says naked drunk Yoda. “Remove your gay earrings and then, train you I will. Yes, hmmm.”
* “Fucking weirdo homophobic Jedi frog, my ear tunnels are fire, not losing them,” says Luke.
* Ghost Ben is too busy drinking ghost whiskey with ghost Qui\-Gon to care for training Luke.
* 
* With 10 tauntaun less and an additional wampa baby, Han whatsapps Lando Calrissian and asks for some help.
* “Whassup whitey boy?” greets millennial Lando.
* “Suh my man, get me a hand with this fucking broken hyperdrive, please pretty please,” whatsapps Han.
* “Noprobman, my negro, just send me an uberorsomething, I will get you some ITtechnissianorHyperdriveguyorlatinoguyorsomething,” whatsapps Lando.
* Han and Leia use an escape pod to get to Bespin.
* In a Vegas\-like Bespin, Leia saves some ugnaughts, tossing them down from the Cloud City, so they can be free from the oppression. Included the robotic lumbersexual beard\-guy Lobot with the rad hipster Bluetooth thingy in his rad bald head.
* For an instant, Leia believes Han Solo is sparkling in the twilight of Cloud City, but is just the moisturizing skin\-care cream the manly beard\-guy is applying himself.
* The Latino master hyperdrive repair guy gets a $10 and a Taco Bell discount ticket, and accepts to go into the escape pod with Han and Leia and Lando, and return to the Nonmillennial Falcon.
* The Latino guy takes a look at the hyperdrive, but… from his toolbox takes out a blaster doing a gansta grip, and takes off his mask and reveals that he really is Boba Fett.
* Everybody points his or her gun at the evil bounty hunter.
* “I knew it, real Latinos wouldn’t want to eat chalupas at Taco Bell! Gimme my discount ticket back!” roars Chewbacca.
* “Yes they would! Any fatass Latino would eat that shit as long as is cheap,” says Boba Fett.
* “OK whiteys, hereismybustop, Igottago FOH, byebye my homies,” says Lando boarding the escape pod while doing some rad hip hop gestures.
* “Byebyemynigga,” says Boba while keeping the gansta grip with one hand, and doing some lame hip hop gestures with the other one.
* “Hey! Watchit! Racist genxer mothafucka!” says angry Lando getting out from the escape pod.
* “Just get the fuck outta here, or I am killing your black funky ass first,” says Boba Fett. Lando shuts up and jumps into the escape pod and escapes.
* To show that he means business, Boba kills a wampa. This is an epic bloodbath.
* “Oh nooo! He killed Kevin!” roars momma wampa.
* So everybody and the wampas surrender.
* “By the way, this is just my pal IG\-88, dead in his wampa disguise, the real Kevin is smoking all of Chewbacca’s secret stash,” says Boba Fett.
* “Fucking Kevin, I’m gonna kill him for real!” roars Chewie.
* Boba Fett forces Chewbacca to brake, so the Empire fleet can reach for the Nonmillennial Falcon.
* 
* “What the fuck are you doing?” asks hangover ghost Kenobi to the kid.
* “Pimping my iXWING,” says Luke while painting a poop emoji in the nose cone.
* “That’s a crappy one, and a waste of time,” says the ghostly boomer watching the smiling emoji.
* “Your generation is overly serious, even when getting drunk with your fucking shitty red label mainstream booze, you look ratchet now,” says Luke.
* “Your generation is all about wasting time,” says Kenobi while walking away.
* “You wasted your life,” says Luke.
* “You are wasting yours,” says Kenobi not stopping.
* “I will be the best Jedi ever, a legend,” says Luke.
* “That’s not what I am seeing,” says Kenobi disappearing.
* “You only see what you want to see, that’s why you failed,” says Luke, alone.
* 
* The millennial boy gets some Jedi training tutorials in YouTube, “Dammit, young people always does the crappy adulting and the mcjob, while lazy old derps get to party and enjoy retirement,” says Luke.
* Luke watches astonished at how hard are the Jedi training tutorials by some hotter than hot blue twi’lek chick, so he just keeps watching, procrastinating his own training.
* Senile Yoda dies of alcoholic intoxication, then ghost Yoda appears and everybody and iR2D2 laughs as the corpse floats down the swamp.
* Searching the web for incest porn, Luke finds that Leia’s Facebook has been taken over by the Empire. Vader has uploaded photos of Leia being grossed out as stormtroopers try milking Han, Chewbacca, AnDroid C3PO and the male wampas.
* Knowing that he is risking his life, seriously, Luke tries to save his friends by using the most advanced and deadly millennial Jedi power, remote attack by force trolling Vader’s Facebook, but he finds the old man has learned to block his account.
* “FUCK! I was ready for the most epic trolling ever!” says the exhaust and almost dead millennial boy, slowly regaining his strength and consciousness, knowing that he will need to bother himself to battle Vader in person.
* Luke milks away some swamp\-slug creature, jumps into his rad iXWING, and flies away to confront Vader.
* “Bye bye, you millennial wanker,” says ghost Kenobi.
* 
* Luke gets into Darth Vader´s Super Star Destroyer because anyone can infiltrate an Imperial Star Destroyer.
* Luke finds Vader already waiting for him. “How did you know I was coming?” asks Luke.
* “I read the Jedi and Sith for dummies book, your generation is just lazy. Join me boy, and I will read the book to you,” says Vader.
* “Really? How the fuck you turn on this fucking laser blade?” asks Luke. 
* “Push the damn button,” says Vader.
* “Button? Button? Buttons are for fucking old\-timers and blackberry lovers. Your generation is just a bunch of insensitive assholes, did you know that I am your son? I got all your receipts here,” says Luke showing his cellphone with Yoda’s Instagram photos of Ben Kenobi pulling out baby Luke from inside Padme.
* “Whaaaa!? Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!” screams Vader running into an airlock and getting sucked into the dark vacuum of space. Now, this Oscar\-worthy improved scene will go into the annals of filmmaking history and will be forever an icon of pop culture, and be the epic stuff memes are made of.
* “You can save your dad! He could survive a couple minutes with his breathing mask and his Sith powers!” beeps iR2D2
* “Nah, he is already dead, he is just a creepy old man,” says Luke and forgets his dad.
* Suddenly, Luke’s head falls to the floor.
* “Why!?“ Beeps iR2D2.
* “Because I felt sus inside him,” says Leia with Vader’s lightsaber in her hand.
* “You mean the dark side of the force inside him? How did you escape the stormtroopers? How did you learn to use the force to feel that? How did you know how to use the lightsaber? HOW???” beeps asking iR2D2.
* “Because this lightsaber called me, and being a woman, I figured it all out. And I sensed he is the one always lurking my reddit and trolling my posts,” says Leia.
* “OK…” beeps casually iR2D2, while quietly leaving with Luke’s body.
* 
* Leia gets everyone aboard the Nonmillennial Falcon.
* “Please leave my nipples alone…” wimps Han asleep while being put in a bed with a sleepy wampa.
* “Give him some tauntaun milk,” says Leia to nurse wampa.
* “We already ate all of the tauntaun,” roars doctor wampa.
* “Then give him some wampa milk,” says Leia losing her patience
* “Wampa milk is not for twerpy human males,” roars the nurse wampa
* “Give him something, he is my 50 shades twilight boytoy, you understand??” asks Leia visibly angry with her finger in the lightsaber handle.
* “OK, OK, I was only joking,” roars the nurse wampa and hurriedly leaves.
* “I love you bae,” says Han suddenly grasping Leia’s hand while crying of emotion.
* “I know, now don’t be a wimp, and let go of my hand because I got to get us the hell out of here,” says the Princess culminating the most romantic scene ever.
* “Fixed the hyperdrive?” asks Leia to hyperspace technician wampa.
* “Yeah, get me one of those Taco Bell discount tickets,” roars the hyperdrive technician mariachi wampa.
* “You! Bounce us out of here, Chewie help him, RN!” orders Leia to pilot wampa, and co\-pilot Chewbacca.
* “Where is iArtoo?” asks AnDroid C3PO.
* “The little narpy fucker is a traitor, now he is an imperial, let’s leave him alone,” says Leia.
* The Nonmillennial Falcon leaves behind the imperial fleet, jumping to hyperspace.
* 
* In the bridge of the imperial Super Star Destroyer, iR2D2 connects a mechanical head onto Luke’s body.
* Luke opens his mechanical eyes and looks his mechanical face onto a mirror.
* “Ah, hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha … uh… sorry, wrong character, wrong actor,” says Luke stopping the crazy laughing.
* “WTF!” says Luke watching himself once again.
* “WTF??? I did what I could, you ungrateful bastard!” beeps iR2D2.
* “Chill…you salty wheeled toaster… my dad was basic Sith, I’m the GOAT now!” says Luke.
* “I have a bad feel… oh no… put on a towel or something, I can see your pinky winky,” says Boba Fett arriving to the bridge.
* “Shut up old man, everything’s on fleek,” says Luke putting some tight black pants.
* “How is that OK?? Shouldn’t this surgery be done in the infirmary? Shouldn’t be better to connect your human head to a mechanical body?” asks Boba Fett.
* “Oh, swerve! You dumb mother fucker,” says Luke while slashing Boba’s chest and cutting his hand, severely injuring the bounty hunter as the imperial captains watch scared.
* “But, I hadn’t had a mother I could fuck, you insensitive millennial monster!” says Boba Fett before dying.
* “OK… iR2D2, go paint yourself black, I can’t let people watch me with you looking basic like that, I need an evil iDroid, I need you woke you know,” says Luke.
* iR2D2 goes without complaining.
* “Oh, and get me a flat blue Bantha\-latte, chunky non\-skimmed, pronto,” says Luke.
* “Now, now, I am thirsty for some rad touchpad black\-handle orange light laser blade…” says Luke browsing Amazon in his iPad.
* “Sir, some idiot white grandpa pilot put the hyperdrive instead of putting the brakes, so… Coruscant and the Emperor are no more…” says an Imperial Captain.
* “Meh, is all right, fucking boomer Palpatine was way too fucking old and fucking cranky,” says Luke.
* “What’s with all the swearing by everyone?” ask the agonizing Boba Fett trying to reattach his left hand.
* “RJ was binge\-watching Tarantino Netflix movies … err no, I mean that’s some Tourette Syndrome with a little Coprolalia and the occasional Copropraxia, we’re more interesting now, that’s nuanced for you, my boring vanilla friend,” says Luke with a tic in his left eye while watching the thousands of selfies on Leia’s Facebook.
* “Nuanced!? Like the freaky milking fetish?” points Boba with the hand in his hand.
* “I don’t know what are you hunty about,” says Luke, busy sipping purple milk while watching a youtuber trying to milk a Dianoga.”
* “What’s with the weird Lando speech? This satire\-writer, I mean RJ, seems to lack knowledge of suave Afro\-American behavior,” says Boba Fett sewing his own chest.
* “Shut up Boba, you are dying RN,” says disinterested Luke
* “But we just fucked up the possibility for a remake of episode VI! No Jabba, no Vader, no Emperor, no Boba Fett! No cool toys! What the fuck is Disney thinking? Your mechanical head is just a lame tactic to get another cheap no\-actor Disney puppet! This trend of subversion of expectations is just stupid and inconsequential,” says Boba suddenly feeling better.
* “The struggle is real! JOMO all that shit! Die you fucking genxer fucker!” says Luke killing again Boba Fett by cutting him in half.
* “Fuck! I should reappear in episode VI! I should have my own Star Wars spinoff movie! Asskissing fucking RJ!! Damn fan\-neglecting KK!! This is just a mainstream corporate PC product trying to look like a revolutionary indie film, and you are just a poser, a snobbish hipster sellout,” says Boba before dying again.
* “Shut your mouth off! Die! I’ll kill you, genxers and boomers, I’ll kill you all! And you, stop breaking the fucking fourth wall! You are not Deadpool! We will have your rad millennial clone Lola Fett in episode VI and her own spinoff, sorry not sorry, TBH,” says Luke cutting Boba Fett in pieces.
* Uncomfortable silence by the scared genxer imperial crew.
* “You are the new big bad, the ultimate boss, the new emperor, we can make a better episode VI and VII, and episode VIII is the GOAT nobody can do a better episode VIII …” says a millennial Captain.
* “Impressive… most impressive… we will break the internet,” says Luke with a deep and mechanical voice.
* “Litty!” whispers the millennial Captain with starry eyes while putting a black cape on Luke’s shoulders.
* Luke gazes at the stars beyond the windows, as the Imperial Fleet under his command travels the vacuum of space.

The soundtrack remasters might be hinting at theatrical remasters,"So I purchased the soundtrack remaster CDs that were released this month. All 6 films supposedly ""remastered"" from the ground up. Obviously I'm mostly interested in the OT soundtracks since they are much older recordings and I figured the PT would sound pretty much the same. I was definitely right about that. As an audio engineer I could pick out some differences in the PT here and there but nothing major. But the OT sounded pretty drastically better.

However I'm here to point out a very interesting part of this. The OT soundtracks have none of the special edition scores/songs, and actually brings us remasters of songs that were cut from the theatrical versions. Some big examples are in the ROTJ soundtrack. No Jedi Rocks is to be found \(thank the Force\), however the song featured in the original version is there \(called Lapti Nek\). In addition, the original Ewok song has been remastered, but no sign of the special edition song that replaced it.

This got me thinking. Could this hint at a remaster release of the original trilogy in 4k UHD Bluray formats finally? Obviously it could be a stretch of a theory, but I'm curious what others think.

Star Wars Celebration Line Experiences,"I've posted this before but I'm hoping to get some more responses so here I am again. Huge thanks to anyone who reads this and lends a helping hand: 

Hey fellow Star Wars fans! I'm currently daydreaming about my Celebration trip next year. I'm hoping I can queue for the Episode IX panel. I've found that there's not a lot of information on what this is like, and I want to change that. So what I need is for as many people as possible to detail their experiences waiting in line. I want to be super prepared!
So if you queued for any of these:
Star Wars: The Force Awakens panel (2015)
Rogue One panel (2016)
Star Wars 40th Anniversary panel (2017)
Star Wars: The Last Jedi panel (2017)

Please help me out and answer these questions:
1. Which panel did you queue for?
2. When did you arrive?
3. Detail your experience waiting in line as much as you want (the more the better, I'll take every minute detail I can get): like when you were admitted into the overnight hall (if applicable), what you did, whether or not you could sleep and for how long, what you brought with you, etc.
4. If you remember what number you were in line, please share!
5. Where did you end up sitting (in which stage, in what section)?
6. What were the positives and negatives about your experience and is there anything you wish you would have known going in?

ANY INFORMATION I CAN GET I WILL TAKE AND APPRECIATE! So if you want to keep talking about your experience outside of those questions, go for it!

I also have a couple specific questions that only one person has to answer:
1. Can you get in and out of line after the wristbands are given out?
2. Do you choose your seats when you get in or are they assigned?

Okay thanks EVERYONE so much! I really do appreciate every single answer I get to this post, no matter how much detail there is! And if you didn't queue or don't want to answer, please UPVOTE so others can see this! The more people see it, the more will have tips about queueing and the more people can give their own tips! Thank you all so, so much and MTFBWY!

Star Wars Vs Marvel,"Just a quick bit about myself, I am a Star Wars and Marvel movie fan, I am not into all the comics/cannon/legend. I am just comparing the movies. There are no spoilers either.

I just watched Marvel Infinity War (great movie) and got me thinking about these two franchises. Both are owned by Disney but have their own movie making company. 

How can Marvel get everything so right and Lucas Films in my opinion get everything so wrong?

The 3 new movies Lucas Films has done have been average at best. The character development in all these films have been poor and hence take away from the story telling. Where as Marvel have excellent character development. TLJ tried to put too many jokes in and took away from the story, when Marvel has jokes that are unexpected and are laugh out loud jokes. The special FX are both on par with each other. 

So do Marvel just have better characters then Star Wars? Or are they just better written then Star Wars? I believe characters and story telling make a movie great and I think that is what is lacking in Start Wars. I grew up watching the OT and these were amazing for me as a child. I look at them now and still think they are great but they are also not perfect. The characters made them great and the story followed.

This is not a rant about who or which is better, it is just my opinion of these 2 behemoth franchises. Please feel free to add or discuss.

Thanks for reading.  ",StarWars,True,1526177224,2018-05-12
Just started reading Heir to the Empire and was shocked to see Coruscant used by name. Did Lucas take it from this book? If so how many other aspects of the prequel trilogy have been influence by the series,I have always considered myself a decent fan of Star Wars. Seen most movies dozens of times over \(except for the Disney ones\) but never read any of the books. For some reason I began reading the books starting with Heir to the Empire and within the first 20 or so pages I saw Coruscant mentioned by name and it struck me as odd so I was just wondering what the deal is in regards to who is influenced by whose work and how much of an impact has it had on the whole,StarWars,True,1526178379,2018-05-12

Why didn't the Jedi expect their troops to turn on them in ROTS? I think I have an answer...,"You know how all of the jedi (minus Kenobi) died and how they didn't see it coming until they were dead? But for some reason Yoda saw them about to kill him and fought back. Also in Rogue One we learn that the dark side surrounds a creature that's about to kill. Why couldn't the jedi sense it? Right after the clones heard ""execute order 66"" why didn't that tip the jedi off? It's because of the inhibitor chips. The clones weren't surrounded by the dark side because they weren't about to kill. They were mind controlled and it wasn't them. It'd be more like a droid about to kill in that the jedi couldn't sense it because it wasn't a natural will to kill. Thoughts?",StarWars,True,1526182489,2018-05-12

"GF agreed to watch ONE Star Wars film, do I choose NEW HOPE or TFA?","So she's never seen star wars and is at the point where she is set on not ever watching them, I'm sure you've encountered people like that and there's no point forcing them (haha) but anyways for my birthday she has agreed to watch ONE film and one film only so this is my chance to get her into Star Wars. My only chance!! So I am split between A New Hope and The Force Awakens. On the one hand, Episode IV makes sense as this is where everyone has started and it's a great and magical film that really introduces the world of star wars. On the other hand, it's old and a bit cheesy and I'm not sure it can stand up to all the expectations she will have about the star wars universe. 

TFA is a great film and modern and fresh  but its downsides are, it has many old characters and nods throughout that my GF isn't going to understand. Help me reddit! You're my only hope. I have a few hours to decide!",StarWars,True,1526186700,2018-05-13

How about this for a Star Wars story?,"Open on a space station in flames, sirens blaring. The camera tracks forwards past separatist and Republic ships slugging it our and flys right through the windows on a concourse where variant clone era troopers fight along side two Jedi to repel boarders. They are business like in their efficient dispatch of the droid invaders. 

They come to a darkened corridor and cautiously approach. Something is down there...  Suddenly a battle droid runs out, looking back into the dark, in terror. It runs right into the leg of the biggest Jedi and crashes down. Shaking its head it looks up to see the Jedi and says despondently ""oh no, now Jedi, today is just not my day"". The Jedi smugly smirks and readies his lightsaber to chop the droid when the coughing starts.

Clank, clank, cough. Something approaches. The Republic forces shift their focus to the dark. The droid takes advantage of this and runs off (Jedi are bad news for a droid, but this thing is worse) . Clank. Cough. 16 packs a day cough...

One lightsaber ignites
Two

Four
Clank
Cough
Clank

Into the light emerges a cyborg fighting machine who snarls ""YOUR LIGHTSABERS WILL MAKE A FINE ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION"". Then he attacks, whirling and battling the two Jedi with four spinning weapons and enthusiastic grunts. The battle is three dimensions as the cyborg fights on any surface including the roof and soon comes to rest by a large observation window opening onto a massive space battle, to face the two Jedi.

A whole platoon of clone troopers run to the sides of the Jedi, many with anti-armoured vehicle weapons, rocket launchers, heavy pulse weapons even gungun energy things. The creature looks around and works out he's out gunned and puts his lightsabers back in their storage compartments in his Cape as if to surrender. He coughs a few times and laughs. ""YOU LOSE JEDI"" and punches the glass window and jumps out, laughing as he does, his cape billowing in the escaping air, sucking troops and Jedi along with him.

Just thought of something,"What if this were the opening scene in Solo:

Han is at the imperial academy training to do imperial shit. Suddenly Vader, Sidious, and Darth Maul come in. We have no idea why Maul is there and it never gets explained because Disney gonna Disney. 

Anyway, Palps says ""I have had a vision."" Han makes some snarky comments like Han, and then Palpatine rages. Han pulls his gun because he is a real man and would never shoot second. 

The three sith ignite their lightsabers and proceed to cut Han into a billion pieces all while laughing like maniacs. 

Flash across the galaxy to Lando waking up, probably on Canto Bight. He has a feeling of relief. Probably because he never loses the Falcon to Han since he's dead. Turns out the OT and ST were all just a fucked up dream he had on a 3 day long booze bender.

A question about what the community wants from Star Wars.,"Hello everyone, me and one of my friends are both huge Star Wars fans. Besides watching the movies we have played all the video games, read some of the book and most of the comics. And even though we disagree on The Last Jedi (i liked it, he didnt) we agree 100% on the fact that the best thing about Star Wars are the stories about force users.

So recently we saw that a lot of the content regarding Star Wars that is produced does not focus on force users. And here i am talking about Rogue One, Rebels, Battlefront II's story, Solo, the new Resistance series, most of the newer books. 

This got me wondering is this really what most of the fans want? I mean from my point of view there are space battles and blasters in any other science fiction movie we don't need them that much in Star Wars. We just want to see stuff about Jedi's and Sith's not Resistance and rebelions. 

Are we in the minority here? And if we are not in the minority why do they keep making this kind of Star Wars content?",StarWars,True,1526224312,2018-05-13

Initially, I was thinking about one of the corny seduction-love scenes between Padmé and Anakin. But remembering some of the dumb shit I said in relationships as a teenager, I can “tolerate” these: it’s just typical of kids freshly falling in love... (e.g “it’s because I’m so in love with you”)

After rewatching episode 8 with my kids today, I think the scene that wins the award of worse scene in the history of SW is Leia flying through space.

A sad story about Battlefront 2,"I posted this on r/StarWarsBattlefront but I think it’s appropriate to put this here also.

Here’s a sad story...

I have a group of six friends that I play video games with. We all know each other in real life from school and growing up together. 

Me
Friend A
Friend B
Friend C
Friend D
Friend E
Friend F

**General Background**
We started playing games together on Xbox during the glory days of Call of Duty when we were in middle school. I’m talking about the Black Ops 1-2 and Modern Warfare 3 era. We also played things like GTA, Minecraft, and Battlefield. As Call of Duty started to die off, we moved away to other shooters. In more recent years, we all started playing Rainbow Six Siege. 


**Star Wars Background**
I’m a hardcore Star Wars fan, hence while I still play this game and spend time on this subreddit. Friend D is a semi-hardcore fan. He keeps up with the community somewhat and knows the lore, but isn’t dedicated enough to follow all the main SW channels on YouTube and stuff like that, like me. He knows who people like BattlefrontUpdates and Star Wars Explained are but doesn’t regularly watch their content. Friends E and F are very casual fans... they know all the movies but don’t know a whole lot about the lore and definitely don’t keep up with the SW community online. Friends A,B, and C are not Star Wars fans and have never really cared much about it at all. They all think it’s a little gay but respect it anyway. 

So let’s look at Fall of 2015. Friend D and I suggested to everyone that we get Battlefront. We tend to get most major AAA games even if we’re not personally interested that much, mostly so we can all have something new to play together. We all enjoyed it as a group for a while, until around January 2016. The lack of content drove us to play games like Black Ops 3 and Rainbow Six Siege more and Battlefront less. By February, everyone except Friend D and myself had stopped playing it altogether. So us two kept playing, but only when nobody else was on and we were bored. By September 2016 (around the Death Star dlc) even he had stopped playing. So I kept playing it by myself through the rest of 2016 and into 2017 because I genuinely still enjoyed it. 

Let’s now fast forward to Fall of 2017. This is around the time of the Battlefront 2 beta. Friend F had since enlisted in the US Navy (he’s a year or two older than the rest of us) and only gets  on Xbox a couple times per month. Friend C didn’t even download the beta. He had absolutely no interest. The rest of us had fun on the beta. I was so happy when they extended it, and I looked forward to the full game.

Now let’s get to November 2017. Keep in mind this period was the early days of Fortnite. We were all playing it. Friend D and I were so excited to play like the gold old days of Battlefront 2015. As someone who was too young to play video games during the OG Battlefront days, being able to play as clones and characters like Maul and Yoda was something entirely new to me. Even playing as Rey in a video fans was insanely new experience, like it probably was for all fans since she’s new. It was just the two of us playing though. Like I said, Friend F is kinda out of the picture because he’s in the navy, and Friend C didn’t want the game. Friends A, B, and E all wanted to wait until December to get the game, mostly because they were much more interested in Fortnite. 

As we all know, the Pay To Win situation rattled the game and it’s community. Friend D, my only friend who’s almost as dedicated to SW as me, quit playing. He was disgruntled by the horrible loot boxes and the ridiculous progression system. He was also not pleased with the lack of Clone Wars content. I felt the same way about everything, but my being a super fan was enough to keep me playing. I put too much time into the last game and looked forward to this one too much to just stop playing it after a few weeks. By late November/early December, Friend D had uninstalled and stopped following this game on the Internet. 

Around Christmas time, Friends A, B, and E got the game. As a small refresher, A and B don’t really care about Star Wars and E is just a casual fan. They only played it occasionally for a couple weeks, but still somewhat enjoyed it. The progression system didn’t bother them because they didn’t play enough for it to affect them, and the lack of content didn’t bother them because they don’t know/care enough about Star Wars to be upset by the fact that major characters like Obi-Wan weren’t in the game. They were just here for the fun gameplay. But they got tired of it, understandably. You can only get stomped on by tryhards in HvV so many times before you get sick of it. 

So I was back to flying solo. It’s now around January/February. Glitches/bugs and no new content reign supreme over Battlefront 2, with no news or information about the future. I’m not the type of person who likes finding random people online to play with, so I prefer playing by myself. 

When we heard about the progression overhaul, I was delighted. I told Friend D about it, but he didn’t really care. He gave up on the game months earlier and had no reason to come back. I told him about Ewok Hunt, and he still didn’t care. Same with the customization. I didn’t even bother to tell him about season 2. 

The decisions made by EA have killed this game. Even die hard Star Wars fans have been driven away. I’m sure there are thousands of people like my friend who would’ve supported this game, but will now never return because of the way this game has been handled. 

The state of this game has killed my interest in playing it lately. I stuck with it hoping it would improve, but it seems like the game’s been given up on. I don’t mean to suggest that EA has killed my interest in video games, but through extenuating circumstances revolving around this game I’ve more or less stopped playing Xbox altogether for the most part. Playing Fortnite with everyone else isn’t even that exciting to me anymore. 

I don’t know how this game will survive when so many other titles are coming out within the coming months, like Black Ops 4, Battlefield 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2, and The Crew 2. 

I didn’t mean for this to turn into a sob story, but I think this story is relevant to the current state of Battlefront 2.

Why I'm Staying Away From Solo. (From A Fan Whose Seen EVERY Other Film In The Theaters Opening Weekend),"Big corporations respond with how we spend our money so I'm withholding mine because I want to see Disney dramatically improve the writing of the Star Wars movies.

And Glover's Lando is so enticing its painful for me to make this choice. TLJ was just too heavy a blow of plot holes, bad character decisions and weak writing in too many places for me to continue to support Disney until they see mediocre is not what some of us fans think of when we think of a Star Wars movie... an event for me.

Why I think Luke will be coming back to teach Rey and the future Jedi after EP9 and beyond,"So the death of Luke hit all of us hard. As a Legends fan it devastated me. Not how he went out because that was cool but that he left nothing beyond. Unlike Leia where it felt like she was passing a torch to a chosen successor who she had trained in poe it felt more like Luke had dropped the torch for a random person to come collect it and then at the end realized his mistake right before it was to late. Their will be no chance for a Jedi Academy game like so many of us grew up playing. No Jedi Order that fixes the mistakes of the past led by the son of the man who destroyed it.  It feels more like any new order that comes along will be soley Rey's and have no connection to Luke or the Yoda\&gt;Quigon\&gt;Obiwan\&gt;Luke chain of masters. So to me I'm really hoping they bring him back to let him teach the future jedi. And I think their are both solid in universe and out of universe reasons for why this could happen. The first bit I will cover is the inuniverse. They say Jason Fry wasn't brought in as a fixer but Fry is one of the people who have had the largest impact on the lore of the universe having written or designed a number of RPG guides and lore books. Over the course of the book he does his best to bring back a Luke that many of us fans would be familiar with, including having a tidbit about Luke's academy being like the one in Legends an allowing emotions, relationships, and training all ages. Now I know we can't take novelizations as 100&amp;#37; canon but their are some scenes that point to Luke's journey as a teacher not being completed. Lets all turn in our copy of TLJ to Chapter 21 just after Luke contacts Leia. He has finally let the force back inside and is letting it flow into him. This is the penultimate step back to the man he was **""A will that had been silent, dormant after the demise of the Sith, only to wake once again during Luke’s exile. A will that Luke finally allowed himself to acknowledge once again""**The force has left him something to do, he still has a mission to complete and one that he has given up on after the destruction of the academy. **""Rey, you were right,” he called as he crossed the meadow in the driving rain, lightning flashing overhead. “I’m coming with you. Rey?.. In trying to shield the galaxy from his failure, he had walled himself off from everything—including the prospect of hope.. The Force had sent Rey, of that Luke was now certain. She had arrived bearing the message he had refused to hear. She was also a young woman, powerful with the Force, who needed his help—and who had believed in him even when he gave her no reason to.""**As he goes looking for her he has realized that he was mistaken that he is still needed and so are the jedi. For a moment he has finally broken out of his bitter depression that made him swear off the jedi and try to drive Rey away in her three lessons. And it comes close to working except for the fact that he finds Rey in the hut talking to Force!Kylo. This slams the door shut once more on the old luke and brings back all the fears he had about what happened to Kylo happening again.  Now lets skip to the scene with the tree. Luke is getting boinked on the head by a little green frog man and told how misguided he was. While Yoda's comment on Rey having everything she needed with her and the tree containing nothing is a play on words with her having already stole everything he also means her outlook and faith in the force. He also brings up something important**""Decide we do not, where our place in this story begins or ends. But time it is for you to look past a shelf of old books.”**The first is to look past the books because they don't matter in connection to what really makes a jedi a jedi. And this will be important in a bit. **""Lost Ben Solo, you did,” Yoda said, gently but firmly. “Lose Rey, we must not.” ""I can’t be what she needs me to be""**The first line by Yoda tells us that Luke's time is not at an end. He even says in a previous line that we don't get to choose when we enter or leave a story. He says that for the survival of the Jedi and the Light Luke must train Rey. And Luke's worry is about not being what she needs. It isn't about dieing and he seems to have no intent in it. Its just about his failure. From whence we get the great line about failure being the best teacher. But with the Falcon already gone how is he to teach Rey?Skipping way to the end of the fight on Crait we get this description of Luke's fate**""Its energy escaped the fragile, temporary boundaries of their bodies and spread until it surrounded and permeated everything..And he heard a familiar voice. Maybe it was real, or perhaps it was just in his memory.*****Let go, Luke.""***Luke's death is different than most jedi. Its more of a conscious decision to  become one with the force not due to death in battle or old age like his masters but though a deep meditation and connection to it. Their is also the possible hint of him being helped along by someone unseen. Also we then have the line by Rey talking about how it felt like he had left with a purpose. So what is all of this leading to? Well that Luke had a reason for becoming one with the force, that in some way it is the next step in Jedi Evolution and will allow him to help guide and train Rey. If all he had to do was buy them time to escape he didn't have to let Kylo kill him though the force projection. And we saw in the fight that the only way Kylo was going to hit luke was if Luke allowed him to. And all he would have had to do after that was send Leia a force message to come pick him up on the island. With the idea being that him ascending to the force allowing him to somehow better teach Rey we have to look at if its possible. Well like a lot of people like to point out the NEU is being sold on everything being super interconnected and on the same level of canon \(now if that's true is another discussion\). So we should be able to find proof that this can happen in the Canon. WE could also look in Legends since RJ himself showed a pick of a Legends Reference book in response to the mind link and force projection powers being used. But we will stick to canon for now. We have to very large examples of this. The first comes from TCW and the Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir comic. In that we can see Mother Talzin use the force \(and yes it is the force and not a desperate brand of magic unconnected to it\) to become incorporeal, exist as a disembodied body and in the comic its self even possess Dooku before creating a physical body out of pure force power and will. Now if that is to Dark Side we have the Bindu, a ancient creature that Kannan Jarrus runs into. The Bindu is also able to take on a incorporeal form, disappear and reappear and other things though shear force power. The Bindu along with the rest of Rebels and things like Mortis in TCW opened up the way for a more spiritual/afterlife/higher existence brand of force usage.  So it is possible that Luke could have planned it out and have the ability to come back and teach but why would he? Well it has to do with Kylo and Rey. First things first lets get this out of the way. THE JEDI ARE NOT GOING AWAY. They are not getting rid of a central IP that every kid and adult dreams of being. What a jedi is and believes may change like it did and legends \(and like Fry said Luke had already changed it in his academy\) but its not going anywhere. So what's wrong with Rey doing it alone? Well first off is that while she is really powerfull thats all it is. Raw power with abilities learned by downloading them from Kylo's head. She has no formal training like Luke had, her personal skills are lacking, and she doens't seems to have the drive or reason to restart the order. Plus most of the Jedi Artifacts/holocrons/scrolls Luke found probably went up with his temple so she would have an even harder time tracking down information. And Kylo? Well if Kylo is redeemed and doesn't die helping to restart the order would be a good way to atone. But first off I'm not sure how the galaxy would feel about that. People balk at how Kyp Durron got off with what was a slap on the wrist for the sun crusher incident. But now imagine he went on to try and run an academy. Or if Revan or Ulric Qel Droma started their own academies. No one would trust them and the viewers would be skeptical of it. So while he can help out with finding students and training them \(if he even wants anything more to do with the force\) I really don't see him running it. Though if they did go that route it would be a nice way to continue the skywalker line and have him seek redemption. Now for all of the OOU or out of universe reasons why I think Luke will be coming back to teach Rey and Future Jedi. Right now love it or hate it the ST is kind of known for killing off the OT. This has left a bad taste in the mouths of many fans and also left a slight problem. And that is who will be there to guide the ST heroes in helping restore the galaxy after the films are over.  Some would say they should do it theirself but to go back to yoda's comment the best teacher is failure and who can teach them if they were all dead. Now maybe if Carrie Fisher hadn't died Leia would have survived on to help guide them into the future. Heck if they keep her off screen Leia can still survive to show up in future books and EU material. But the basic idea is they need someone from the OT cast still alive to connect the series back to the rest of the saga and to act as a guide to the ST heroes going forward. Espically since in mine and many other fans opinions it just feels like everything was torn down just to see the ST heroes do everything the OT heroes did in Legends. Having at least one of the three \(if not both Leia and Luke\) around to guide them would make it feel more like a earned continuation than just ripping it all down and starting over. A second thing is that Mark Hamil seems much more pleased about the next movie. Now he is a trickster and he likes to joke a lot on twitter but some of his recent tweets have seemed to suggest looking forward to the movie. And this is after him saying he didn't really feel the same about it without Fisher and Ford being there. The comment \(joking or not\) about May the 9th not ruin anyone's childhood had sparked a bit of hope in people along with him tweeting back a person asking if he will be in the next episode the line ""no one is ever really gone""The third and final thing is that JJ is a large Luke Skywalker fan and had talked about wanting to be able to use him. He didn't get the chance in TFA though he set up a good base that TLJ could have followed. So  this movie would be his \(possibly last\) chance to use Luke Skywalker in a film. And with his love of the OT what better way to end it with Luke returning the Jedi to existence by trainign Rey and future jedi. What do you guys think?AN: I will say their is bias on my part since I want my Grand Master Luke back with a functioning Jedi Academy and that having one led by Rey just wouldn't be the same at all to me. I like Rey but growing up with Legends, the Jedi Academy games, etc Luke is the one I need to see bringing the light of hte jedi back to the galaxy. ",StarWars,True,1526267463,2018-05-13

Best thing and worst thing about the new trilogy so far?,"We've gone through Episode 7 and Episode 8 of this new trilogy, and Episode 9 is a year and a half away, which will end it. So, looking at this new trilogy so far...what would you say has been the best thing and worst thing about it?

I'd say the best thing so far has been the new characters. There's been a couple duds *cough*Rose*cough*, but overall, all the new people are great. Rey is awesome, Kylo Ren is awesome, Finn is awesome, Poe Dameron is awesome, I even think General Hux is awesome. The two movies have done a great job of bringing in great new, memorable characters. 

To me, the worst thing is the wasted potential. I won't get into anything, but, I  feel like there is a ton of things that this trilogy could've done going as far back as certain things in Episode 7, that they haven't done. The trilogy has been good, if not great so far, but I feel like if they did certain things they could've easily done, it would've been amazing. I am hoping Episode IX does bring in certain things. 

For example...I feel like we need to learn something new. We need to learn something new about the Force, older characters, unanswered questions, etc. We need something that really takes something we've had in the Star Wars lore and flip it over it's head. I don't think this trilogy has really done that. But hey, JJ Abrams still can in Episode IX. ",StarWars,True,1526272443,2018-05-14

As the first episode of Clone Wars, Ambush did kind of have to make a good impression, and from my point of view, it succeeded. It didn't really have too much of an effect on the overlying story, it was just a fun standalone episode to start everything off. It also gave us a bit of initial insight into the clones, and their view of themselves, and I liked how Thire was retconned into the soldier who says 'No sign of his body, sir' in ROTS.

"How can the new movies possibly be bad, when original participants are involved???","The issue is: Disney is partaking in the corporate level of name dropping here. "" john Williams is scoring the movie!!!"", ""Lawrence Kasdan is writing the script!!!"" That's great; if I was Disney I would do that for sure as an easy way to associate current projects, with previous projects that have a high level of nostalgia. In tandem this technique also creates a nice, neat deflector shield of sorts to nullify any criticism towards the new project.  ""How can you criticize this new project, it has original participants working on it?"" 

Here's the rub: Even though Lawerence kasdan is involved, doesn't mean that he is beyond current Disney corporate guidelines \(agendas\) when penning the script. Remember, at the end of the day, this is just another paycheck for Lawrence. He has had writing success throughout the years but, realistically this is an opportunity for him to cash in on a project from his golden era. For what they are paying him, I'm sure he has no issues towing the line. Also... As disappointing as it may be, at almost 90 yeas old, I'm sure John Williams is involved in name \(drop\) only and a team of ghost composers are writing the music for the new movies. Is this an assumption? yes. But it is probably the truth.

There is a very large community of intelligent, articulate focused people who have legitimate criticism for for this ""Disney Corporate agenda"", The criticism is largely focused on a specific and forced type of social politics That they feel Disney ""irresponsibly"" injects into the new movies. These same very passionate Star Wars fans feel that Disney is also proceeding very carelessly with the quality of writing and the handling of classic characters in their beloved franchise. if you were interested in learning more of the specific issues a large population of the fandom has with the current state of Star wars watch some vids from these you\-tubers:

Could the First Order have limited heavy anti-ship weapon production?,"So I love a good space battle, so it puzzled me that the First Order has many very large ships in TLJ that don't really do anything. 3 ships in the begining who just wait for the Dreadnought to do the heavy lifting and only launch fighters. And more ships that just shadow the Supremacy while it fires at the Raddus and co.

It makes very little sense given how they can build Starkiller Base and the Supremacy and Dreadnoughts and thier own versions of Star Destroyers so why not the weapons to equip them to do thier job? If they were equipped to fight capital ships why don't they?

I would ask you, what would you do given you outnumber your enemy, you are not limited on fuel, and have many ships capable of fighting ships of equal size? Is the answer, just wait? Personally I would hyperspace those ships into ambush positions and drive my enemy into them.

So again I can only imagine they cannot hold thier own against the Raddus and that would require them to not have weapons capable of damaging it at all. Outnumbering your enemy and barraging them with weak but effective fire is a strategy and it works.

"About moment in the Solo trailer when Beckett says ""betray you"", and it cuts to Lando","As a black man, I've always been sad that the biggest black character in star wars' name, is synonymous with betrayal. That moment in the trailer always stings a bit.

Especially since I feel Lando is misunderstood. His actual deal, when the empire arrived on his door step with the deadliest and most cruel man in the galaxy, the emperor's right hand man, was to protect Han and his friends, AS WELL AS, the people of Bespin who obviously trusted him to look out for them. With the only person to suffer, some guy named Luke, who Lando had never heard of before and owed no allegiance to.

The end of the film makes me feel that Leia and Chewie, although angry with him in the heat of the moment, understood what an awful position they'd put Lando in, leading Vader to him and endangering the people of bespin. They seem very chilled with him, and Lando even borrows Han's clothes, which I feel Chewie wouldn't allow if he still blamed Lando.

As a poc, I naturally have an affinity for Lando, who for almost 2 decades was the only black man in the galaxy. It's just painful that a big part of his legacy is ""BETRAYAL"".",StarWars,True,1526319433,2018-05-14

Does anyone else think Rebels honestly has the best Vader portrayal?,"At least in terms of showcasing what a juggernaut he really is. People constantly talk about how Rogue One shows Vader as OP, but for me it's honestly Rebels. The thing with the Rogue One scene is, the whole slaughtering a bunch of dudes with blasters is pretty common jedi/Sith fare, but with Rebels? We finally see what happens, on screen, when Jedi try fighting Vader. Sure, he only has two duels, but, just look at them, very first duel Vader nearly manages to kill Kanan and Ezra while *wanting them to escape*, for most of the fight he never even utters a word, just appears and attacks. Then immediately after slaughters a fighter squad singlehandedly. Then of course there's Malachor, where Vader disarms Ezra in about three attacks after uttering one of his best lines that really captures the menace of Vader IMO, ""You will die braver than most"". And then, later on, after the Ghost leaves Malachor he starts attacking Ahsoka so viciously that literal divine intervention had to save.

In my opinion, Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori--the composers for the original Halo Trilogy and the first Destiny game--should be picked to compose Kenobi's music.

I think O'Donnell and Salvatori have the right style to convey the emotions of a beaten man who is entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the galaxy's hope for peace and freedom, and the one who will help bring balance to the Force. Their greatest work so far, ""Music of the Spheres,"" is evidence of their ability.

The Mortis Arc tells the entire star wars 9 movie arc. INCLUDING LAST JEDI,"Obi-Wan Kenobi: Where's Anakin?

The Father: He came to me for guidance, but at the crossroad, only he can choose. The Force will be his guide now.

Obi-Wan Kenobi: I don't like this. What have you done?

The Father: I have done nothing. I am merely letting the will of the Force take shape.

Obi-Wan Kenobi: Where has he gone?

The Father: To the Well of the Dark Side. 

----------------------------------------------  

 Luke: You went straight to the dark.

    Rey: That place was trying to show me something.

    Luke: It offered something you needed and you didn’t even try to stop yourself.

_----------------------------------------------------

  Rey: Why did you hate your father? Give me an honest answer. You had a father who loved you; he gave a damn about you!

    Ren: I didn't hate him.

    Rey: Then why?

    Ren: ""Why"" what? [pauses] ""Why"" what? Say it.

    Rey: [sobbing] Why did you...why did you kill him? I don't understand.

    Ren: No. Your parents threw you away like garbage.

    Rey: They didn't.

    Ren: They did, but you can't stop needing them. It's your greatest weakness. Looking for them everywhere, in Han Solo, and now in Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened that night?

    Rey: Yes.

    Ren: No. He'd sensed my power, as he senses yours, and he feared it. Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.

    Anakin: You must know I will never join the Dark Side willingly!

    The Son: How simple you make it. Light and Dark...as if there is one without the other. Allied, you and I can restore balance wherever we go, peace to the universe.

    Anakin: By becoming a Sith?! Never!

    The Son: [furious] We will DESTROY the Sith! And the Jedi!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ren: It's time to let old things die. Snoke, Skywalker, the Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels; let it all die. Rey...I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy!

    Rey: [starting to tear up] Don't do this, Ben. Please, don't go this way.

    Ren: No, no, you're still...holding on! Let go! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Anakin: No. No. NOOOOO! [he falls to his knees, close to tears] I will do such terrible things...

    The Son: Yes...but it doesn't have to be that way. The choice is still yours to make.

    Anakin: How?

    The Son: The future, by its nature, can be changed. Join me, and together we will destroy this Emperor that you see in your visions, then we shall end war, corruption and suffering throughout the galaxy!

 Anakin: [hesitant] Will we bring peace?

The Son: Of course.
-----------------------------------

The Father: Forgive me, Daughter. I am an old fool who believed he could control the future. Now you are gone... and all is lost. Sleep well, my child. Sleep free.
-------------------------------------------------

Rey: You didn't fail Kylo. Kylo failed you. I won't. 
---------------------------------------------------

    Luke: I saw darkness. I sensed it building in him. I'd seen it in moments during his training. But then I looked inside, and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction and pain and death, and the end of everything I love because of what he will become, and for the briefest moment of pure instinct, I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow, and I was left with shame and with consequence. And the last thing I saw were the eyes of a frightened boy whose Master had failed him.

    Rey: You failed him by thinking his choice was made. It wasn't! There's still conflict in him. If he would turn from the Dark Side, that could shift the tide! This could be how we win!

    Luke: This is not going to go the way you think!

    Rey: It is. Just now, when we touched hands, I saw his future. As solid as I'm seeing you. If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

    Luke: Rey...don't do this.

    Rey: Then he is our last hope.

---------------------------------------------------------------------



The Father: Do not underestimate my son. He will seek your ship to escape our isolation and sow terror through the universe. And while you are here, he will use you to do it.

Anakin Skywalker: What will you do now that he's given himself over to the dark side?

The Father: It is my actions that have unleashed great danger on the universe. I must kill him.

Anakin Skywalker: But he's too powerful for you alone.

The Father: Hmm, perhaps, perhaps not. The Force will decide.

Anakin Skywalker: I can help you.

The Father: The choice is no longer yours to make. Both our destinies are clouded. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Father: I held hope that you could resist the dark side. But I see now... there is no going back.

The Son: Father.

[the Father stabs himself]

The Son: No! What have you done? It did not have to be this way.

The Father: Yes, my child, it did. You and I are tied together, and your strength runs through me. This way, I take your power.

The Son: [gasps] Please, don't die.

The Father: I always knew there was good in you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Rey: Is it true? Did you try to murder him? 

--------------------------------------------------------

The Son: [gasps and groans as Anakin stabs the Son with his lightsaber] And so you have betrayed me, Father.

Luke:See you around Kid

The Real Problem with The Last Jedi (Not Clickbait!),"Like most of the people on this subreddit, I grew up with Star Wars. It is my childhood and unfortunately it is being RAPED by people who DO NOT understand Star Wars. That’s the real problem with The Last Jedi. Rian doesn’t understand what makes Star Wars Star Wars. So I figured I would help Lucasfilm by telling them what he got wrong with Star Wars: The Last Jedi since it’s evident they don’t understand. And before anyone says “well this is just your opinion” I want you to know it’s not just my opinion. My mom agrees with me. 

1-The Dun Duns. 
Every Star Wars film HAS to open with the dun duns! I can’t put my finger on it, but The Last Jedi has bad dun dubs! HOW COULD THEY MESS THIS UP!? 
2-Dog Man Rawrs
The dog man HAS to rawr. In the previous movies he got like 30 rawrs a movie but in The Last Jedi he only has like eight I DON’T LIKE THAT! 
3-It’s a Trap Fish
Rian mercilessly killed the its a trap fish like he was nothing but a meaningless background character fans only remembered he’s a meme with a fish head. WE LOVED THE TRAP FISH! HE DESERVED A SPIN OFF TRILOGY! 
4-Leia
Is it just me or did they turn Leia into a lesbian with purple hair girl? WHY NO KISSING SCENE!?
5-Snoke
Snoke was supposed to be Darth Plagueis the Wise yet no one in the movie mentioned his tragic story! IT’S NOT A STORY THE JEDI WOULD TELL YOU!
6-Canto Bight
Why did they spend so much time on space horses? SPACE HORSES!? So uncreative! I WANT FILONI SPACE WHALES! 

7-Kylo Ren
Kylo isn’t scary. Villains MUST be scary! He needs his mask! Star Wars villains have to wear a mask! CHANGE MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE!
8-Rose
ASIANS!? IN MY STAR WARS!?
9-Luke
LUKE ISN’T SUPPOSED TO BE MEAN! LUKE IS SUPPOSED TO BE NICE! ME HATE! ME HATE A LOT! 
10-Han Solo
WHERE WAS HE!? Darth Maul got cut in half but he survived! Han Solo was a secret force user! He should have used his light side abilities to survive and come back in a surprise twist and beat his dumb son up! ME HATE!

The video game side of Star Wars is lacking...,"I have a proposal to Disney and I know they won't see this, but I just wanna say that if they would approach the video game side of Star Wars the same way they approach the films, we would be better off. Let directors and Game Studios pitch ideas and lease out the license to them to tell stories. 

For example you could even re-brand the titling of all the games that get released to make it clear that they are canon. Similar to how all the spin-off films are 'A Star Wars Story' maybe the video games would be 'Insert Title: A Star Wars Experience' treat them like the spin-off films. 

I think a Darth Maul centric game would be amazing to do. Or even a game set somewhere in the 10 years that separates Phantom Menace &amp; Attack of the Clones that deals with an Ashoka aged Anakin and his master Obi-wan. There's so many stories to tell that it just blows my mind that no one at Lucasfilm is jumping on this. 

I just really want EA's grubby and greedy paws off of Star Wars. There is so much potential for stories to be told. Imagine Cory Barlog of Santa Monica Studios directing a Star Wars game? Disney needs to really begin to re-think their deal with EA imho. Flame me, idc, it's how I feel. Peace.",StarWars,True,1526341450,2018-05-14

The Old Republic Is Canon (Confirmed Via Clone Wars Quote),"After re-watching The Clone Wars, I've noticed a peculiar detail in one of the scenes. While watching Obi Wan's fight with Pre Vizsla, (linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vtj5YxDcCk ) there was a peculiar quote that caught my interest. (Can be found around 38 seconds in) ""This lightsaber was stolen from your Jedi temple by my ancestors during the fall of the Old Republic."" This is most likely referencing the Sacking of Coruscant, in which the Jedi temple on the planet was attacked. Since The Clone Wars is considered canon in Disney's timeline, this quote alone is enough to prove that Star Wars: The Old Republic is in fact canon.

Kylo, er, probably the one that annoys me because, far as Rey and Finn are concerned (and very many characters in the SW-verse) he got off pretty light, basically had a mental breakdown because his uncle got into the booze again and his parents weren't around much, pretty crappy if you're a kid, still easier than half the SW universe and definitely doesn't justify becoming a murderous nutjob.

But Finn? Why is there absolutely no attention to his backstory whatsoever? We're told to feel bad for Kylo, we're told how hard he had it, but, Finn was a fucking slave too, like Rey, except his slavery consisted of being raised from birth to be a soldier.

Discussion: The Last Jedi is not that bad,"A lot of people bashed on this movie and I wanted to share my (unpopular) opinion. The Last Jedi was pretty good. To get it out of the way, yes, Rose wasn’t all that great and the casino story was way to long and Leia flying through space looked corny. The movie had bad parts, but it was not bad. There was some amazing stuff, like Crait, the hyperspace scene, Rey and Kylo’s story, the throne room scene. Not to mention they finally addressed the balancing of the force. It isn’t about light side users eradicating all dark side users or vice versa. It’s about the force being balanced between the two. The mosaic in the pond in Luke’s cave is of the Jed’ai (ancient Jedi) who held both the light and dark side of the force. This is a great set up for episode IX with the force being balanced instead of dark side or light side winning. Also, Snoke has a line that justifies the sith rule of two. I don’t remember the line, but imagine the force is like a bucket. If there are ten Jedi using the light side, then they each get one tenth of the bucket. If there are two, they each get half. This is why the sith are so powerful in the prequels, because each Jedi only gets a small percentage of the light side, while each sith gets half. Make sure to defend this movie whenever you get the chance, because it doesn’t suck.",StarWars,True,1526347024,2018-05-14

"An analysis of ""balance to the Force"" in the wake of TLJ (opinion piece)","Most devoted Star Wars fans are aware of George Lucas' original intent that ""Bring balance to the Force"" was synonymous with ""Destroy the Sith"".  The Dark Side itself brought imbalance to the Force, nothing to do with a balance between light and dark but since he never put that concept to paper or film it was up to the Lucasfilm storygroup to interpret after the sale of the franchise to Disney.

Over the last few years we've had fed to us bits and pieces of their seemingly different interpretation, capping off with TLJ in 2017 which dropped the biggest nuggets of info.  The quality of the ST as Star Wars movies will always be up for debate between fans but the lines of dialog regarding balance in the Force are now part of canon and they warrant some further analysis.

Together with revelations from the Clone Wars series, Rebels and the saga films we can piece together how we're now supposed to understand this concept of ""balance"" (I'm omitting novels and comics since they get ret-conned all the time so they always need to be taken with a grain of salt).  This is how I summarise it:

* A light side user can be out of balance (Bendu episodes of Rebels and Yoda's final episodes of the Clone Wars)

* A dark side user can be in balance (rebukes from Snoke, a dark-sider to Kylo for being imbalanced).

* The first Jedi preached balance (Luke's dialog with Rey in the first Jedi temple on Ahch-To)

* Anakin (or Luke or both thanks to the uncertainty thrown in by Obiwan and Maul in Rebels) was the chosen one who would return balance to the Force when it was in a state of imbalance

None of these points negate the possibility that Anakin was the chosen one who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith.  One of the things that, though never stated, actually makes a lot of sense is that the Sith are not just dark side users but *unbalanced* dark side users, like Kylo Ren.  Such disciples of the Force bring about responses from the Force itself to reattain balance (Anakin and Rey).

This begs the question then, why did it take so long for the chosen one to be born?  This is where the episodes of Clone Wars and Rebels dealing with Yoda and Kanan respectively provide some insight.  If it were only Kanan we could chalk it up to lack of wisdom but Yoda being forced to deal with his darker side I think shows us that the Old Republic Jedi were also themselves bringing imbalance to the Force to some extent.  Everything was at tipping point come ROTS, where the entire un-balanced dark side is represented by two Sith against hundreds of Jedi and one of those two Sith are killed.  This is the time for the chosen one to act, first to balance the overwhelming light and then against the darkness that is left.

Some Jedi like Obiwan and Yoda under the guidance of Qui-Gon (the first truly balanced force-user we see in my opinion) or Kanan with the Bendu are able to attain balance and as such they become one with the Force when they die (time will tell if we ever see Kanan as a Force-ghost or whether we already have as a wolf).  Anakin also achieved this, not because of any teaching but because he attained the same balance on his own when finally finding his redemption.

This also explains in part why Yoda and Obiwan were so certain that you couldn't come back from the Dark Side.  They were fighting against the very pull of the living Force to save Anakin before the purge was achieved and how a farm boy from Tattoine could achieve what these Jedi masters could not.  Anakin really did have ""new powers"" that Obiwan underestimated in their battle on Mustafar and Palpatine's weakness really was his overconfidence built by years of having the living Force behind him.

So take it or leave it, to me these revelations have made Star Wars so much more interesting.  It reminds me of my time as a kid reading the EU and ingesting every little detail of how the Force worked.  The answers will never all be there but I'm keen for more from the current storygroup.  I'd love about other people's take on it all.",StarWars,True,1526367104,2018-05-15

Crucial Solo detail: Parsecs and piloting,"In the original film, Han tries to sell himself as a pilot and the Falcon as a ship by claiming that it “made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs.” Since parsecs are a measurement of distance instead of time, I’ve always found that line intriguing as it foreshadows Han as both someone who will lie to get what they want and someone who can think quickly on his feet, which in my mind always made Han along with Lando the most morally intriguing Star Wars characters.

But from the upcoming LEGO sets and a Ron Howard tease, it’s as good as confirmed that this interpretation of the character will become invalid as we see him zoom through the Kessel Spice Mines. What does everyone think about this characterisation of Solo - does it matter? Is it more or less compelling?",StarWars,True,1526388877,2018-05-15
Mortis predicts Episode 8 - an explanation,"Earlier I posted a long line by line comparison so I thought I would post a short version.  Mortis basically foreshadows a lot of what is coming for Anakin, Luke, and Obiwan in the future. Its like the revelations or nostradamus vision of the series with a lot of symbolism. 

Lucas wanted a long dagobah scene when he asked for it. As the jedi are trapped in the force conduit, the sights sounds and events match and fortell whats coming.

Interestingly if you watch it now youll notice that it just doesnt foreshadow the rise and fall of vader, but the events of new trilogy as well. Kylo Ren and the Sons lines and views line up in their goals. They both kill their father to free themselves after they are seduced to the dark side. They both attempt to turn a jedi against both the sith and the jedi to bring balance peace and order.

Luke and the father both concerned with the deviation of the son or Kylo try to change the path of the force, cementing the very path they were trying to avoid. They both atone for their sins with a battle and act of betrayal. Saving the heroes from the wrath of the Son who was attempting to find the ship belonging to the heroes to symbolically release their wrath on the galaxy

Rey plays a bit of anakins role their she goes to the father, Luke, and enters the well of the dark side which is calling out to her. They literally confront the dark side of the force for an understanding.

Thoughts about dissatisfaction with Luke in TLJ,"I just recently rewatched TLJ and I realized something about the general dissatisfaction of many fans about how Luke is portrayed. If the prequels had come first, and everyone was aware of Obiwan’s past when watching ANH, I think there would be very similar concerns about Obiwan and the anticlimactic way that his and Vader’s fight ends, especially considering their history (which was unknown to the viewer at that point). If the story had been established by then, I think people would have expected a lot more from that interaction, or from Obiwan in general. He himself really shows no interest in being the hero, as seen by his beginning to train Luke—he also considered himself ready to retire the hero role, much as we see Luke do in TLJ. The parallels of their stories are quite interesting, and I do think we’ll be seeing some more of Luke going forward, in force ghost form, which is pretty exciting to me actually.

Did the TOR story ever end? So what happened to the Eternal Empire? Do you want any of it to inspire the future?,"I know that the whole story from The Old Republic is a bit of a bloated mess due to it being based of a MMO and that it isn't canon anymore so it doesn't really matter but I just wondered if they ever resolved how that all went down.

Don't hate me but I never really found the story and lore created from that game to be that engaging as it all felt super derivative and bleak in how the galaxy was locked in what seemed an eternal cycle where basically the same conflict would just repeat over and over again with it not really mattering who won or lost. That's some 40K level grimdark right there.   

Just looking at the old EU we had these Sith conflicts 
1.The Great Hyperspace War
2.Great Sith War
3.The Jedi Civil War
4.Great Galactic War
5.Second Great Galactic War (electric boogaloo)
6. Eternal Empire conquest
7.New Sith Wars
We get a break from the monotony of some version of the Sith Empire Invading the Republic with the Clone Wars and Galactic Civil war
8.Sith–Imperial War

I'm sure we each have our personal favorites among that list but we have to admit that there was a lot of retreading there. For anyone who is critical of the sequals for being too derivative you have to admit the old timeline was pretty cookie cutter. 

For fans of TOR or for any of the other mentioned old republic materials what would you like to see either covered in some new material or at the very least codified in some form of history of the galaxy? All I know is I'd like to keep the number of Sith invasions down to an actual thematic and interesting number and possibly keep the number of secret thousand year old god emperor's below zero

Does anyone else hate the First Order?,"I don't mean ""hate"" as in because they're bad villains, I mean hate as in they're *bad* villains.

They keep pulling out superweapons like they're some Scooby Doo villains. Like seriously, how many superweapons were destroyed in the last movie, like 4? It seems a recurring plot point, ""Oh no, the first order has a MacGuffin! We must destroy it!"".

They really have no explanation for why they have more resources than the Galactic Empire anyway, which is weird, to say the least.

On top of that, the names in the First Order just inspire no dread about them. Hux seems like a discount Tarkin, Kylo IS a discount Vader, Snoke is a discount Sidious (albeit he's probably the best antagonist out of any of them), and Captain Phasma is...interesting to say the least, I don't think she had any real role in the movies, her total screen time in both movies amounted to less than [4 minutes](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls027631145/)

While we're discounting stuff, overall the First Order is just an Empire rip-off. They could have done something cool with them, like maybe change the way that they're governed, but no, they're almost the exact same besides the visual design.

And while we're talking about that, the Empire at least had the cool aesthetic of being evil space Nazis, but the First Order is ethnically diverse now which kinda ruins that aesthetic. As much as people grilled that Rogue One writer's tweet for saying that the Empire were white supremacists and the rebels were ethnically diverse, I think Rogue One staying true to the roots of the original trilogy and acknowledging the parallels between Nazi Germany and the Empire was better than this convoluted piece of shit.

Remember Digimon? Does Kylo Ren seem a lot like Ken to you?,"*It's been about 20 years since Digimon began but it's still Crunchyroll, so **SPOILER ALERT** if you haven't seen season 02 and need a not-crap anime to binge.*

The redemption of Ben Solo in particular is really important to me. Meanwhile, other people around here don't think he's redeemable at all. What am I seeing in Ben that they're not? Maybe I'm seeing Ken.

I watched *Digimon* on Fox Kids back in the 00s. [Ken, The Digimon Emperor](https://i.imgur.com/WFzZp72.jpg) (""Kaiser"" in some regions) from season 02 reminds me a lot of Kylo Ren. No, it wasn't an influence on the ST; Ken and Ren just draw on common tropes of darkness and redemption. Similarly, I imagine that if The Green Ranger was your favorite Power Ranger, you might be more sympathetic to Kylo Ren also. Digimon Season 03 [continues the redemption theme as well](https://i.imgur.com/v7rD90z.jpg).

Here are some things Kylo and Ken have in common:

* Is a formidable villain the heroes fight
* Later it turns out there's some other baddie above him
* wears dark clothes with a cape and a mask
* Uses an evil alter-ego and the heroes initially do not know who he really is
* Feels entitled to rule everything
* Has a flying warship base
* wields ""dark"" powers
* Is actually *very* insecure
* has exceptional talents but also looks down on others because of that
* Was at first a good person with a great destiny (Digi-destined), but was corrupted by darkness
* As a child, tragic events and pressure to be successful make him susceptible to the influence of an adult with powers of darkness who promises to make him stronger but is actually using him as a tool
* His parents are good people but they don't realize what's happening to their son
* Is isolated from other people
* Handsome, has nice black hair. One of the hero girls is attracted to him
* Eventually has an [emotional one-on-one confrontation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyTJxvHvgFo) with one of the heroes and gets knocked on his ass

Yet unlike Kylo, Ken [enjoys the villain role](https://i.imgur.com/lkziN1R.jpg), while Kylo doesn't seem to enjoy it at all. The other Digimon heroes defeat Ken and and he redeems himself, becoming part of the hero team for the rest of the season, where he is more demure and deals with his guilt. Kylo's story isn't over yet, but I don't think it's going to end in darkness either, nor would I hope for something so hopeless.

And yes, Ken actually [does end up marrying one of the hero characters](https://i.imgur.com/r2IkXhi.jpg) he had fought earlier in the season and they make babies. So although I do not require ""reylo"" the idea doesn't seem implausible to me because Digimon done did it already.",StarWars,True,1526416450,2018-05-15

"""The OT heroes are now failures!"" | Is that a fair complaint?","The way I see it, each generation of heroes has some successes and some failures.  No generation is perfect.  

Obi-Wan failed to keep Anakin on the right path.  HUGE failure.  But he makes up for it by keeping an eye on Luke and introducing him to the Force when the time is right.  This ultimately leads to the destruction of the Empire.  

Luke failed to restore the Jedi Order.  Again, a major failure.  It is part of the reason why the First Order is currently seizing military control of the galaxy.  But like Obi-Wan, he gets his redemption.  He is the spark of hope that will inspire the next generation of Jedi Knights.  And given how TLJ ended, I can only assume that he plans on taking an active role in the formation of whatever Jedi organization comes next (""peace and PURPOSE""). 

Maybe while Rey is off being our main hero and saving the day, Luke is putting together a family of potential Jedi for her to lead into the future.  He gives her the gift of family that she's long desired (outside of her new friends).  That's how he can make it up to her.  

I dunno.  All I'm saying is that just because the previous generation left of a mess for the next generation to clean up doesn't mean that the previous generation was worthless.  And that's what some people here are making it sound like.",StarWars,True,1526419230,2018-05-15

Disney Springs Orlando Store Merchandise (Lightsaber Question),"Hi All

I went to the Disney Springs Star Wars store tonight and the one unique thing was they had full size lightsabers for $150. 3 styles. Rey, Vader, and Kylo. The heft and feel was excellent (as a 501st member, I found them pretty darn nice) but they were not Black Series. Just Disney labeled versions. 

I’ve never seen this before and the staff claimed many have come and bought several because you can’t find them anywhere else. 

Can anyone shed any light on this model who may have passed through Orlando? I didn’t take photos and I apologize. I’ll be back tomorrow as my trip is ending but wanting to see the pulse of reddit first. 

Thanks",StarWars,True,1525317819,2018-05-02
Unpopular Opinion: I enjoy the both the Legend/EU and the Disney cannon.,"I love the EU. But there's no real way in my mind that starting filming so long after ROTJ would allow the EU to have been truly adopted. The suspense of what's next is gone and a lot of the EU sunk into disarray over the years. Given the current ages of actors involved, there'd be so much history missing to the general audience about our main characters. We'd also have no Chewie which would be a rotten shame. I do love how Disney is incorporating elements from the EU in the new cannon here and there. It's a bummer that so many posts here end up being flame wars over Disney sucking. Kathleen Kennedy has produced so many films I've loved since childhood and the creative teams involved all love Star Wars, it saddens me to see so many hateful comments about her. I don't know, I just feel it's perfectly fine to have two universes that are vastly different. 

Lastly. Here's George Lucas talking about the EU. 

“Once Vader dies, he doesn’t come back to life, the Emperor doesn’t get cloned and Luke doesn’t get married…”

“I don’t read that stuff. I haven’t read any of the novels. I don’t know anything about that world. That’s a different world than my world. But I do try to keep it consistent. The way I do it now is they have a Star Wars Encyclopedia. So if I come up with a name or something else, I look it up and see if it has already been used. When I said [other people] could make their own Star Wars stories, we decided that, like Star Trek, we would have two universes: My universe and then this other one. They try to make their universe as consistent with mine as possible, but obviously they get enthusiastic and want to go off in other directions.” – George Lucas, from an interview in Starlog #337",StarWars,True,1525318534,2018-05-02

They look awful in the films, but in the animated shows they’re really awesome aliens that I could totally see being a thing in real life.

Why is Kylo redeemable?,"I’ve seen some people on this sub (and tons of people on r/starwarsspeculation) post about their expectations for a redeemed Ben Solo in Ep. IX, and it leaves me scratching my head in disbelief. 
This guy is responsible for the murders and destruction of Luke’s entire Jedi Academy and indirectly responsible for Luke’s death, serves as Emperor of a regime that is literally a metaphor for the nazis, and stabbed his own father through the heart (who in irl is one of the most popular characters in all of pop culture). 

Also, I understand that Kylo has shown moments of doubt or weakness, or pulls to the light. But, this is a guy who has had multiple opportunities for redemption and every time he’s thrown it away: the bridge, the throne room. He clearly wants to be a bad guy, even if it rips his soul in half in the process. He’s the opposite of Darth Vader in the sense that he’s joining the dark side not to save his loved ones like Anakin did for Padme, but rather to serve his selfish hunger for power. 

With all that being said, if someone on here could explain to me how or why this character is redeemable, that would be most appreciated. 

P.S - Reylo is not a cute couple idea in my mind. It’s kind of sick, so I’m not gonna buy it as a good reason why Kylo should be turned.

To those who liked or disliked TLJ and the Sequel Trilogy as it stands.,"What are the reasons as to why you believe others like/dislike TLJ and the ST in terms of its creative and narrative direction? 

Specifically, to those who are fans of TLJ and the ST, what are the reasons that you believe explain the views and perspectives of those who dislike both? To those who disliked TLJ and the ST, what are the reasons why you believe there are still fans who enjoy the film and Disney's handling of the franchise in spite of the immense and plentiful amount of criticism over the direction the franchise has taken since TFA? 

This is a thought experiment I had in mind to gauge what fans on both sides of the TLJ/Disney divide have to say about the other side. And in a way that tried to avoid the usual ""Older fans hate the ST, younger fans like it"".

And also try to avoid comments like saying:

&gt;""People who like TLJ and the Sequel Trilogy are Disney/Rian Johnson apologists with absolutely no standards and do not get Star Wars. It is an objective fact that TLJ is a terribly written, poorly executed film that has caused irreparable damage to the franchise's reputation, and is an insult to everyone who grew up with the OT with how they treated Luke. There will be no arguing this fact"".

&gt;""People who hate TLJ and the Sequel Trilogy are just a bunch of reeing OT fanboys that are still bitching about why their fanfiction ideas and fanon theories for the ST weren't made canon, why Rian Johnson raped their childhood,  and they act like they are the only ones whose opinion matters when it comes to Star Wars.""",StarWars,True,1525320942,2018-05-03

I think people are wrong about their hate for the ST,"Hate me all you like but the OT did the same thing not fulfilling potential set ups made in previous movies like “There is another” and so on. You really think they planned for Leia to be Luke’s sister after Luke had a serious crush on her for the first two movies and they even made out? No, that was a decision they made later on. Ewoks are campy, Rose is campy. The emperor was teased in ESB just like Snoke was teased in TFA. It’s the same thing except this time they killed that red herring off a movie early so the final movie in this trilogy can explore something new. “The whole movie is one big chase scene”, yeah well so was ESB. Hate the humor in these movies? Does anyone refer back to the amazing jokes in the OT? No, because they were just as silly in those movies. 

“ They destroyed Luke.” But like how tho. Just because Luke helped turn Vader, doesn’t mean he can’t be tempted ever again. Let’s not forget the circumstances of Vader’s turn. Luke had already gone rage on him, but off his hand and was ready TO MURDER HIM if the emperor hadn’t opened his mouth and snapped him out of it. Luke had a moment of weakness when he sees the horrors of what Ben’s future will bring on the galaxy and specially those that he loved. When was the last time Luke raged out like that? Oh yeah, when Vader specially threatened his sister. Just as Yoda told Luke, his problem is that he’s always focused on the future and never focused on here and now. That’s his massive flaw. And Rian explained that his exile to the island was a misunderstanding of the lesson Yoda taught him. He was supposed to stay on Dagohbah and complete the training even if that meant sacrificing his friends. Now, Luke is making that same hard decision that he couldn’t make before but to he extreme. Yoda is the one who brings him back and tells him that there is still good the legendary Luke Skywalker can do besides seclude himself form the galaxy. And Luke dies in the act of being the ultimate representation of the Jedi there could ever possibly be. “A Jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack.” The force projection to defend the rebellion and allow them to escape while sparking hope in the galaxy once again is such a powerful send off to one of the greatest characters of all time, Im sorry if you feel otherwise, but it’s so true to what heroes and the Jedi Luke always wanted to be.

There’s always gonna be people saying “this movie is objectively terrible on ever front.” And to that I say I’m sorry this movie hurt you, but I find it to be incredibly faithful to what Star Wars is. Of course there’s so much more people like to complain about like Rey is a Mary Sue, Poe’s an idiot, Holdo is the worst, Leia’s scene is unbearable, Rose is a horrible character (this is one complaint I kind of agree with, I just find her to be overly preachy and cringey), and the hyper space attack breaks the Star Wars universe (if you think this, I feel bad for your inability to enjoy epic moments like this in a universe about space wizards and laser swords). I can argue about all of these topics. You’re not wrong to dislike these aspects of the ST, I just find a lot of it to be hypocritical. However there is also some legitimate critique like Poe and Finn’s arcs in the movie are kind of at odds with each other which makes it tonally confusing. There are some other ones as well. I have a feeling I’m going to be called a blind SW fanboy or just an arrogant asshole who can’t let others have opinions, which really wasn’t the point of me making this. Just after so many months of seeing people call this movie trash and a franchise killer, I just wanted to point out why this doesn’t make any sense to me.",StarWars,True,1525330267,2018-05-03
"According to you, which are some of the major plot holes in The Last Jedi?",,StarWars,True,1525334826,2018-05-03
"To those blaming JJ, Rian, Kathleen, &amp; Disney for not making Luke, Han, and Leia a ""badass trio"" as the focus of the sequel trilogy.","That thread showing ""what could have been!!!"" with the EU book cover is really ignorant, along with a lot of the comments blaming JJ, etc..

I feel like the ST hate crowd thinks this is somehow JJ/RJ's fault that they're not the focus of the trilogy, or immensely badass and awesome, going on adventures and whatnot.

Lucas had 30+ years to make a 7-9 while the actors were still able to be main characters (and physically able). Even then, Lucas has said if he ever made 7-9 it'd still be about the younger generation (focusing on young teens). His outline that he had for 7-9 basically had a version of Rey (then called Kira) going on an adventure and finding an exiled Luke Skywalker at a Jedi Temple, and her helping him reconnect to the force, etc.  It's pretty likely that Kylo was also in George's notes to some extent. If you don't believe me, go read the TLJ art book or any of the interviews with the production and concept art crews. So, no matter what - Lucas was never going to make them the focus. It was going to focus on the new generation, as Star Wars always does.

Not only could the OT cast no longer be action stars because they're 65-75 by the time 2015 came around, but in what world would that be a good story? ""Hey kids, let's go see the new Star Wars! The main characters are old people that I used to watch!"" 
Again, Star Wars is primarily made for kids. Always has been. They were never going to make Luke, Han, Leia the focus of the films after the Disney acquisition. 

Well why not?!

Carrie could barely walk on her own, Harrison looks like he was about to have a heart attack in TFA trying to run around, and Hamill wasn't even able to do many of his own (very minimal) action scenes in TLJ. None of them are in particularly great shape - but aside from that, they're old.

Again, Lucas had the chance to make films where they could be that badass trio you imagined. But the films Lucasfilm made starting in 2015 were never going to focus on those characters. 

If you want to be upset that we didn't get Luke, Han, and Leia in action again like the OT - be upset with George Lucas. Don't blame JJ, Rian, Kathleen Kennedy, or any of Lucasfilm because they didn't make a film with out of shape 65-75 year olds as the focus.

You guys can dislike TFA/TLJ all you want. But when the source of your hatred is ""they did xyz to the OT chars, and they should've been the main story! Fuck you JJ!"" That was never going to happen. Luke was never going to be the Qui-Gon Jyn or Obi-Wan in ROTS type Master, Leia was never going to be able to run around and be a badass, Han... well, Han got to do more of that - but it was pretty noticeable how out of breath the poor guy was on screen. 

TL;DR: Stop blaming Lucasfilm or Disney because you didn't get your head canon with the OT trio being super mega awesome for 3 more movies.  It was never going to happen in 2015. Maybe 1995.

I can't help but wish a company like Rockstar Games were given EA's contract.

Something you can pick up and play whenever you like and just cruise around trading, collecting bounties or even make money from moisture farming ha!

Does anyone know why we can't get a game like that?

So im a newbie to the StarWars franchines and well the first film is kinda meh...,"First of all, please excuse the spelling and grammar as I'm on my phone.

I'm a self proclaimed geek, I love all things to do with space and aliens and stuff like that.

I'm 27 and I've never watched Star Wars so decided to jump in with the first film as I was tired of feeling totally out of sync with popculture. 

This is my 3rd time watching the first film the first 2 times I stopped halfway through, I just kept losing focus constantly and found it rather dull.

I felt like it sprung so many characters on the audience with little to no background or build up on those characters, I found it difficult to relate to any of the characters and just struggled to find the film interesting.

The only thing I liked was probably the droids, chewie and the other cool alien life that appeared throughout the film. Janna the Hutt was entertaining and cool to see, while they were on that planet that was the best few minutes of the film in my opinion.

There was some humourous bits the R2 unit and the other droid were funny but that's about it the plot line was rushed and I feel like I was dropped into the middle of a story that I'd missed loads of, there were also so many scenes that I felt pointless and felt my attention drifting so many times.

My question is, does it get better than this, this was one of the best selling, sell out Star Wars movies, yet I'm failing to see why. I want to love it, I want to love the franchise, I'm normally very easily pleased and not a huge film critic but this was a bore fest.

I had never seen Star Trek either and gave that a try over the last few days and I LOVE IT! Even the older versions, the stories and characters, plotline, the science and tech it's all amazing even the pilot episode from so long ago was cool seeing the aliens do an Adam and even experiment on the crew. That was fascinating.

I was kind of hoping Star Wars would be on the same level or better but I have to say I'm so disappointed so far. 

Does the series get better? Do I stick it out or if I hate it this early on in am I still going to hate it later on?

I hope I've caused no offence here, I want to love this desperately I feel like I'm gonna be one of the few people who doesn't like it but I'm failing to see what the draw is to this franchise at the minute.",StarWars,True,1525389754,2018-05-03
I think we need new labels for the eras.,"For a long time now, people have referred to the eras of Star Wars as the ""Original Trilogy"", ""Prequel Trilogy"" and ""Sequel Trilogy"". However with the release of Rouge One, Rebels, and the upcoming Solo, the placement of certain content is starting to get a bit too messy.

Personally, I've consider those three, as part of the OT due to the fact that they take place after the rise of the Galactic Empire, however many claim they should be considered part of the PT, as they're set before A New Hope.

This has brought me to the conclusion that we really need to adopt new labels for the eras. Because there's no denying the fact that Rouge One, Rebels and Solo are all connected far more to the OT, than the PT, yet they're also all considered prequels.

Now I'll admit, that I'm probably not the best person to actually come up with this, as I couldn't actually think of one that wasn't just as confusing for the PT (though either CW (Clone Wars), but that leaves out anything prior to AotC, or OR (Old Republic), but that get's confusing with KotOR's era), though anything set after RotS could simply be GE (Galactic Empire), and anything after RotJ perhaps NR (New Republic).

Anyway, just a thought I had.",StarWars,True,1525390137,2018-05-03
"So I've just watched the first movie for the first time ever and well, I hated it...","First of all, please excuse the spelling and grammar as I'm on my phone.

I'm a self proclaimed geek, I love all things to do with space and aliens, the cosmos, I love sci-fi films, stories, so I thought Star Wars would be right up my street.

I'm 27 and I've never watched Star Wars so decided to jump in with the first film as I was tired of feeling totally out of sync with popculture. 

This is my 3rd time watching the first film the first 2 times I stopped halfway through, I just kept losing focus constantly and found it rather dull.

I felt like it sprung so many characters on the audience with little to no background or build up on those characters, I found it difficult to relate to any of the characters and just struggled to find the film interesting.

The only thing I liked was probably the droids, chewie and the other cool alien life that appeared throughout the film. Janna the Hutt was entertaining and cool to see, while they were on that planet that was the best few minutes of the film in my opinion.

There was some humourous bits the R2 unit and the other droid were funny but that's about it the plot line was rushed and I feel like I was dropped into the middle of a story that I'd missed loads of, there were also so many scenes that I felt pointless and felt my attention drifting so many times.

My question is, does it get better than this, this was one of the best selling, sell out Star Wars movies, yet I'm failing to see why. I want to love it, I want to love the franchise, I'm normally very easily pleased and not a huge film critic but this was a bore fest.

I had never seen Star Trek either and gave that a try over the last few days and I LOVE IT! Even the older versions, the stories and characters, plotline, the science and tech it's all amazing even the pilot episode from so long ago was cool seeing the aliens do an Adam and even experiment on the crew. That was fascinating.

I was kind of hoping Star Wars would be on the same level or better but I have to say I'm so disappointed so far. 

Does the series get better? Do I stick it out or if I hate it this early on in am I still going to hate it later on?

I hope I've caused no offence here, I want to love this desperately I feel like I'm gonna be one of the few people who doesn't like it but I'm failing to see what the draw is to this franchise at the minute.",StarWars,True,1525390500,2018-05-03

What are your thoughts on a Qui-Gon movie?,Personally I would love to see how Qui-Gon met the force priestess but I hadent seen anyone talking about about this idea so I was wondering what you guys thought about it.,StarWars,True,1524445464,2018-04-22
My concepts for Star Wars IX,"The concepts are not write in a proper order to a script, they are just humble ideas of my head that i would like to see. Pardon my bad english.

The movie begins with Leia and Han bringing Ben Solo to the Jedi Temple of Luke as a kid, the sequence represents hope and shows the epitome of Luke's joy with his goal, there is a strong sun light, the first shot is the back of Leia and Solo with their son in front of then, Ben is introduced to Luke, we see numerous kids of numerous species training while Luke talks to Ben. Ben goes to sleep and the scene cuts, to the exact same bad, with Ben in the exact same position, but now he is older, the camera walks back, we see a green lightsaber, Ben wakes and the whole Last Jedi scene is shown, but this is by Luke's perception, we see the regret on Luke's face, Ben push him in the fight, everyone wakes up, Ben starts a riot, some of the apprentices get confuse and reluctant of what Ben is talking, it's very fast, some of the apprentices go to Ben's side and others defend Luke, forming the Knights of Ren, they execute the others apprentices and destroy the Temple, some of them are not sure about and feel regret. It's raining and we see that shot from TFA, Snoke calls for Ben, the sequence end.

Now is present time, six months after TLJ, we see Rey training in this academic center, in one line of dialogue is established that she is training with masters beyond anyone of the Resistance could understand, a reference to force ghosts. The Resistance is in a planet with many features, a prince contacted then and offered shelter and assistance, this happened after the First Order increased taxes and regulated trade routes. The prince already had contact with the Resistance, but decide to join then now that their economy is being interrupted, and they know that their taxes can go to another genocidal nuclear weapon like the Death Star. They are alien, i don't know the species, i'm lazy.

Kylo Ren is in one of his homes, a great palace, he is sitting in this chair, it is night, the only apparent light is from the fireplace and the moonlight from the window behind him. He goes to this room of artefacts, open a capsule, Vader's helmet is there, he confess to the helmet like if it was a priest, says that he is bigger than Vader, even the Palpatine, now that he dosen't have a master, he tries to contact Rey, he want's something more now that he has everything, she cut the force call, she knows that Kylo chose and there is nothing that she can do it now, she's still training, he goes train, we see this parallel of Kylo's training, with anger, and Rey's training, with control, it's a simple way to show the protagonist and the antagonist.

Kylo wakes up, he goes to a First Order base, we see the knights of Ren, without helmets, the goal here for Kylo is to summon the Knights to find the Resistance, since Hux has failed to track down the militia for months, Kylo knows their knights, he knows that some of then have regret and doubt, he ask to one of then, to make contact with Luke, this Ren Knight is sort of a monk, not a Sith, and far from a Jedi, but a force user, that permit him to manipulate the force in sort of a balanced way, he accept, he trust Kylo.

We see Luke, in this little home, not with the glow around him, we are in his spiritual plane. Luke feels the call, he allows contact for a fraction of the time, but he knows what happened before, his failure is based of impulsive attitudes with his apprentices, Yoda appears, he closes the apprentice, he says that Luke already fixed his mistake, there is no need to do this again, he contacts Rey, it's reveal that he continues to train her. We see the Ren monk locating Luke, with that little time he was able to find his location, now he has a planet in his mind, a palace, for the First Order this may be the Resistance location, or not, but with Hux failure, this can be the closest that they had in months of finding the Resistance.

One scene would be about Luke and Anakin's relationship of father and son, Anakin would appear as the exact same from Revenge of Sith, they would talk about failure and how Luke still could convince his old apprentices, telling the truth to then, there would be this shot of Hayden Christensen and Mark Hammil resting their heads on each other, i would cry like a bitch, genocidal Anakin and Luke almost killed Swolo in the same scene... My dream.

The movie would finish with Rey training the next generation of Jedi's continuing Luke's legacy.

Question about Palpatine and Anakin,"Palpatine created Anakin Skywalker, right? Because in Episode III, it is implied that Palpatine was taught by his master Darth Plagueis to create life by the manipulation of midichlorians. It was also determined in Episode I that Anakin had the highest midichlorian count of any Jedi ever. Even if it’s not canon, this is something that boosts my opinion of the prequels and midichlorians themselves as a logical platform for Darth Sidious to create his ultimate pawn for galactic domination.",StarWars,True,1524445888,2018-04-22

The first contradicting Star Wars title?,"After watching TLJ again, I noticed the title kinda contradicts itself in the end. Luke really nailed down why the Jedi needed to end with him, as foreshadowed by the title. However in the end he tells Kylo that he *""will not be the last Jedi""* and Rey will evidently be taking on this place.

If we look at the other SW movies, the titles always meant what they read.

-The first one made you think Maul was the phantom menace but it was later (in the same movie) revealed to be Palpatine.

-The clones attacked.

-And the Sith are getting their revenge.

-Luke was the new hope.

-Then the Empire struck back after the Death Star.

-And the Jedi [Anakin] returned.

-Now the force awakened within Rey?

-And the last Jedi was meant to be Luke but they're coming back now.

I just found this one detail kinda odd, what do you think?",StarWars,True,1524451213,2018-04-22
If Disney doesn’t make a Kylo Ren movie that’s a huge opportunity lost.,"Adam Driver is arguably the most compelling actor in the newest trilogy. His character is multifaceted, charismatic, tortured, and the ultimate scene stealer. They’ve already set up an opportunity for a spin off movie with the flash back that Rian put in the Last Jedi.

This also gives the opportunity for everyone to get the traditional Luke Skywalker action that everyone craves, before he turned his back on the Jedi and became jaded. I think both actors would be on board, especially Mark Hamill who hasn’t held back on his opinions in terms of Rians perspective on Luke. This will give him the opportunity to Luke again. 

It would also be cool to dive deeper into Kylo Ren and see exactly how he got to be the way he is in the trilogy and maybe how he came to be apart of the Knights of Ren. Kinda how we saw Anakin’s transition, but preferably in one movie and less convoluted.

The only issue is that we already know a lot of his past and it would be easy to have the film be an unnecessary addition to the universe. With that said I would still welcome it regardless. ",StarWars,True,1524451429,2018-04-22

"A plot device in Rogue One that really bugs me - how come the X Wings are not able to be contacted once they are engaged?

On Eadu or whatever it was called, they can't call the X-Wing attack off because they're ""already engaged"". This hasn't ever been a problem, communicating with ships in combat. Like, ever. 

The OT, PT, ST never had issues with contacting someone who was in combat, even if it was from far away. 

I've seen a lot of people excuse this as the weather being bad, so that the comms weren't working, etc... 

Well, that excuse is invalid because the Rogue One crew was using the walkie talkies or whatever to talk to the Rebels on Yavin, in the exact same place the X-Wings were at.

I have some ideas about episode IX that I really think would be good.,"Obligatory IMHO stamp. (It should be obvious in this sort or post but trust me, you can never be too careful)


So let me just establish the level of my fan-dedication. If you don't care, skip over the following paragraph.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I just want to say that as Star Wars fans go I am not the most vehement. Never played any of the video games, the only EU I've read was a couple comic books (Dass Jennir, bless him). My opinions are bog standard, prequels have value but are hard to watch, fantastic designs, not so fantastic conveyance. OT is great, I enjoy ANH the most, agree that ESB is probably the most superior film, ROTJ has problems but has high highs. Went mad for TFA when it came out, calmed down a bit now, wish there was no starkiller. As for TLJ, let me say I'm one of those 'better on rewatches, has good and bad bits, overall good impression' people.
Right, those are my credentials. Assess my opinion as you will and have mercy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, so now, episode IX. Nothing here is a coherent plot outline, just some factors I believe would be good.

Gotta have a couple of years in time jump. Gotta. Just makes everything easier for the writer.

In regards to Kylo Ren: On the one hand, I think he can't just be redeemed and hang out with the good guys. A redeemed person would feel tortured by his deeds. Heroic death is always an option, but we've already had that with vader.
I think he should be redeemed, because isn't that what star wars is about?
So exile is probably our best bet. After all, what do force users who have failed do?
One more thing: I find myself still not feeling convinced that he is Han Solo's boy. 'Too much of your father's heart'? When exactly? I'd love there to be something in him which made me think of Han. Both Han and Leia were boxes of Sass in their youth, so with Snoke gone, he should somehow indulge.
Also, had a little idea for his redemption. Correct me with lore if I'm wrong, but perhaps only light side users can see force ghosts. As such, Kylo Ren, conflicted as he is, eventually gets a call to the light so strong that he sees his grandfather, and they have quite the chat.

In regards to Hux: I don't think there's much chance of making him the big bad, but he could still come into play. (See: regarding the knights of ren.)

In regards to Snoke: He's dead, but that doesn't mean we can't give him a lil' bit of backstory. A couple of lines would do, just to quell the fan outcry. Here's my idea:
He was just like Anakin, a boy, a slave strong in the force. However, he was never picked up. He developed power on his own, watching from the sidelines. He lived a bitter life, and was inspired by what Anakin became, Vader and all. Imagine if Harry Potter never got the letter to hogwarts and was left with his abusive guardians. To me, that could be Snoke. AU harry potter with a dash of Tetsuo.
This could also establish another character who developed the force without training, but through belief in himself.
This could just be a throwaway somewhere, it would at least make some fans happy, right?

Regarding Rey: Rey's never had a problem with the force because she has always had belief. She is a diehard fan, believed all the stories of skywalker, she even called Solo 'the smuggler'. Yes, she eventually lifted some rocks, but size matters not. Now that she's had some years to comprehend the fact that her parents were totally unimportant (if you subscribe to the idea, which I do), she has started to lose all that confidence. Maybe she's like the fanbase? Maybe she thinks that she can't do it if she has no skywalker pedigree. In a reverse of Luke's character from Jedi, she is troubled with power, and is actually trying to hide her weakness from the rebellion. They want her to start training more jedi since she is the last good force user, but she doesn't even know dick! And she cannot read the texts, because wouldn't it sort of make sense for Rey to be partially illiterate?
Maybe, like in crouching tiger hidden dragon, she is trying her best to enhance her technique using only the pictures.
And maybe it is Ben Solo's belief in her power which will allow her to get a hold of it.
Dunno, just spitballing.

Regarding Finn: He's been rising up in the ranks, but he's having troubles of his own. Namely, how can he keep killing stormtroopers? How can he command anyone, lead soldiers to their death. He could remember times in the past where he and his comrades shared feelings of defiance. This crisis could be sparked when he shoots an old comrade without realising. His problem is no longer loyalty to the resistance, as Rose said, he now believes in saving what he loves. But there are stormtroopers he loves. Do they not deserve to be saved?
Perhaps in a twist, his real role will be to inspire the Stormtroopers themselves to insurrection. That would change the dynamic for the final battle, wouldn't it? He could have a cool outfit that was resistance but with symbolic stormtrooper paraphanelia.
And with that, Finn becomes 'A Big Deal.'
He needs to fully reconnect with Rey about this too.

Regarding Poe: Poe has learned the lessons Leia and Holdo tried to teach him. But now he needs to earn respect from the old rebellion advocates (who have helped rebuild the resistance to something reasonable). Lando can be here if we so desire. Poe needs to earn their respect, after Leia promoted him to General as her last act. His loyalty to her name is fierce, but everyone is going on about what she did, and they are less preoccupied with what he can do NOW.
These people are the same ones who distrust Finn and don't think Poe was right to promote him. So now Poe is under Leia's shadow, and he's got a turncloak Ex-stormtrooper as a best friend! One who assisted him in a mutiny which caused the near end of the resistance, no less!
There might also be contention building between Finn and Poe of it's own kind. Finn has begun to object to the killing of stormtroopers, and when he vanishes to perform his insurrection, he has to lie to Poe about it. Ooh, tension! (Even romantic tension, if you want to go that way.)

Regarding Rose: We can't just get rid of her. That would be mean and sloppy IMHO. She doesn't have to be a main character, but then again, neither was Lando in Jedi really. Just there to help in the final battle is all. Her arc can be getting over Finn in some way.

Regarding The Knights of Ren: I want them. Give me the evil knights of the round table. And give me a selfish knight who wants to overthrow Kylo. Perhaps Kylo is less harsh than what some people expected, and black-knight thinks he can do a better job. Perhaps Hux teams up with him, and between them they have an angry hux and a force user to protect hux from being bullied.
Don't know what the rest of them do. Probably side with Kylo, since it's more interesting if the antagonist isn't a goliath for once.

So between insurrection which weakens internal structure, and a growing stormtrooper insurrection, and attacks from the resistance, the first order falls apart. But instead of being eradicated, it collapses into warlord (knight) factions which will have beef with each other.

In regards to Reylo: Forcetime messages again. They are still bridged, they were all along, all Snoke did was press the call button. What makes it interesting now is that it only happens when one of them wants it to happen. Rey finds herself going to him because she has lost faith in her own force, and although he knows he shouldn't, he's helping her. And that is what makes him fall to the light enough to meet his grandpa and let the sand tip him all the way to good.
No kissing required (but possible).

Smaller things I think would be kinda nice: C3PO tries to help Rey with reading the jedi texts, since he's a protocol droid. They have a heart to heart about Luke, and Rey knows stories of C3PO in the legends. And she has a soft spot for droids. C3PO gets bashful.

Something between Chewbacca and Kylo. Ben probably knew Chewy as a child, like a fluffy uncle. Getting attacked by him cannot have been nice. Chewy doesn't have to forgive him, but there should be some aknowledgement of some kind. He's more than a walking carpet.

Perhaps a good way to introduce the black-knight character would be to show him leading an assault on Canto-Bight, destroying the town and burning those horses. Good way to show how scary he is and a bit therapeutic for the fans that hated the place.

Maybe there's a statue of Phasma somewhere that Finn and the rebel stormtroopers could topple, I dunno, could be stupid, could be nice.

An old man once said the 'death' of a Jedi makes him more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Luke, prove it. Just once.

And that's it. That's what I got. What do you reckon?",StarWars,True,1524491261,2018-04-23
Is it worth it for me to get into the Clone Wars or Rebels animated series?,"Hey r/StarWars,

I'm a moderately big fan of star wars and have enjoyed all the movies (yes, prequels and sequels too, don't hate).  Recently I've heard from multiple sources that the clone wars (and rebels?) series are pretty good and interesting and worth watching.  I've watched the first 2 or 3 episodes of clone wars and didn't love it.  It seemed a little too kid-ish for me and not really compelling.  Does it get better? better writing/plot or anything?

Please stop saying that the rise of the First Order meant the OT Rebels fought for nothing,"Tomorrow is ANZAC day in Australia where we commemorate the Aussie and New Zealander soldiers who fought in the first and second world wars.  Too many times since the release of the first two installments of the sequel trilogy I've seen fans try to justify their distaste of these movies by their impression that the achievements of the first Rebels meant nothing if the First Order rose out of the ashes of the Empire.

If you're someone who thinks this I want you to understand something:  TFA occurs some 30 years after ROTJ and the second world war occurred 21 years after the first.  Now perhaps the people I'm addressing are too young to even consider this possibility but would you have ever told a first world war veteran that they fought for nothing since there was only a reprieve for 21 years before another threat replaced it?  I sure hope not.

It might seem like a romantic idea that heroes fight in wars for the future generations but most heroes fight in wars for the people of their own generation.  Countless innocents through the first half of the 20th century owe their lives to the bravery of soldiers who were willing to shed their blood to save a stranger from oppression.  To those who served in the first world war the fact that another war would come in 21 years was irrelevant in light of how many people were suffering in their generation.

Now it's perfectly justified to dislike the sequels because you would have preferred a happier ending for Han, Leia and Luke.  I'm a little bummed about that myself.  That said, the next time you try to say that the rise of the First Order makes meaningless the defeat of the Empire, consider the disrespect you heap on the very real people throughout history who've offered their lives to save the oppressed.  No war in history has ended all wars and no defeat of an evil power has meant that another would never rise in its place.

The Rebels won 30 years of galactic peace and freedom from oppression.  If only the people of this planet could be so lucky.

What are some alternatives to Starkiller Base?,"I'm a big fan of TFA, I think it's the best Star Wars film since 1983, but there are some criticisms I have.

The homages to the originals didn't bother me much, seemed very intentional to ease people into the film, but once the audience is in you should start to take it in new directions.

The three major criticisms I have are 1) R2 waking up for no reason, 2) The ground literally splitting apart to end the battle with no casualties, and 3) Starkiller in general.

Starkiller is the biggest, most prevalent problem in this film, and I'm having trouble coming up with solutions, if we were to hypothetically remake Force Awakens.

So far I've come up with is having the First Order take over with shear military might, and having the finale be the rebels disabling a flagship.

BioWare Appreciation Thread,"Not to take away from some of the other video game developers that contributed to the Star Wars Video Game Golden Age. a.k.a SWVGGA, or ""Swagga"" for slang.  (Say, for simplicity's sake, 2000 - 2010, although 1996 did have Shadows of the Empire that I took a shine to.) But BioWare truly opened my eyes to the *story* potential within the rich Star Wars Universe.  I was fortunate to grab KoTOR when it released, not sure what to expect, but I was absolutely floored.  I realized, almost right there and then, that I was an official Star Wars fan, not realizing it had more to do with the games and novels and not the films, but I took it all.

KoTOR was awesome in so many ways, claiming to be 4000 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire.  It dove into lore and treaded new ground that still fit in with everything Star Wars.  I don't want to belittle Obsidian Entertainment, as they carried the torch with KoTOR II quite well.  

But I avoided the MMORPG The Old Republic, due to the fact that I have never enjoyed a true MMORPG.  I even bought into the Destiny 2 hype train, and still got the sticky feeling that I loathe so much.  So, I saw a post last week-ish here on this sub, showcasing at least an hours worth of TOR cinematics, and was stunned.  I downloaded the came this weekend and threw in a dozen hours.  It's certainly still a MMORPG.  You walk up to a NPC who has a quest, claiming they are in danger and you are apparently the only one who can help fight the monsters, whilst another live player in the background is seen tearing through monsters and moving on as they respawn.  Standard MMO stuff for me, but what I have seen so far in terms of story is still huge in my eyes, introducing all sorts of lore that feels real within the SWU.  The OT and ST still have us stuck on a 30 year time span, following a small group of characters, which now feels incredibly small, thanks to BioWare.  

If we are to have hope that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss will visit an entirely different time period than the Skywalker Saga, then I pray to our Universe that the Star Wars video games, highlighting BioWare's entries, are listed on their homework list.

Do old fans just hate Rey for some reason?,"I have observe two rather common types of people who I'm not sure about

The ones who think she is overpowered: well, to be fair she has advanced rather quicky especially compared to fan favourite Luke. She isn't really exceptional compared to other popular characters like Ezra or Bane or managed some pretty impressive stuff with little or no understanding of the force. I guess some people just don't know about that time Ezra gave out a rather nighty force push to save his teacher simply because he was scared that the big bad sith leader was about to kill him, or read the books about Bane. Or saw that one episode where Ezras friend flew a tie fighter  hanging outside by his feet which is a pretty amazing display of flying ability by any star wars standard.

the other type are the reylos: I just fundamentally disagree that she should have any responsibility in the fate of Kylo, and am creeped out by the people who want her to want him or feel like she should even care.

My theory on the Force [TLJ Spoilers],"This is my idea of what is happening with the Force throughout the films.  This is my first post here. Sorry it's long.


The Force has always existed. It is part of all living things, but desires a deeper connection with the intelligences of the universe.  The Force discovered it was able to have rudimentary communication with people who had midichlorians in their bodies. The more midichlorians, the stronger the connection would be.


But there was a problem, the midichlorians became imprinted with the emotions of those they inhabited.  As they became imprinted they only responded to certain aspects of the Force, the so-called dark and light sides. 


This is why the Jedi chose children to train, to imprint their midichlorians with the light side of the Force. Over time, the generations developed more and more midichlorians leading to stronger connections with the Force, especially for some families, but wider divisions between the light and dark sides.


The Force sought to create a balance between the light side and the dark side, to stop the endless war between the Jedi and the Sith.  It created a person with midichlorians that were already imprinted with the dark and light sides, Anakin Skywalker. 


The Jedi were unsure about Anakin because he didn’t fit the into their ways of thinking. No one had ever had both light and dark side midichlorians in their system. Their hesitation to train him and to deny him the title of Jedi Master stems from this. Anakin also struggled between the light and dark sides. Eventually, he chose to follow the dark side, but still having the light side midichlorians in his body, Luke was able to reach him and turn him back from the dark.


After Ben Solo fell to the dark side, and Luke Skywalker shut himself off from the Force, the balance again needed to be restored. But by now, the Force had learned something new. Through communicating with those Jedi who had become one with the Force, it had learned to connect with people without the need for midichlorians.  The first person it was able to communicate with this way was Rey. 


Rey is not tempted to belong to either the light side or the dark side. She feels the calling of both sides and does not resist either one. Her natural connection gives her abilities not seen in the midichlorian-based Force users, enabling her to use lightsabers and Force powers without extensive training.


At the end of The Last Jedi, we see the young boy casually use the Force to grab his broom. This indicates to me that the Force is now connecting with more and more people. Soon, all the people of the galaxy will be able to communicate directly with the Force.  I believe Yoda explains this to Luke while they watch the tree burning. This is why Luke is at peace at the end of the movie. I don’t believe he dies. After reopening his link with the Force he discovers that he can choose to become one with the Force without dying first.


TL;DR. The Force at first used midichlorians as a conduit to connect with people, but this was flawed and led to the Sith and Jedi wars. Anakin was an attempt to balance the Force that failed. With the help of Yoda, Obi-Wan, et al the Force learned to reach everyone without the need for midichlorians. Rey was the first, and the rest of the galaxy will follow.

Tell me if you think anyone would fund this short film idea. Here’s the setup:,"17 year old Breton Seer and his father, Dax Seer, live in the heart of Hosnian Prime. Split from his mother at a young age, Breton doesn’t know much about the circumstances of her disappearance... but Dax does. And when he receives a sudden and unexpected secret message from his wife, urging him to take Breton and leave the planet, he questions the validity of her request. She was, after all, part of a strange imperial remnant faction. 
But then he saw the lights. The red lights, in the sky, hurtling towards them. 

Breton saw them too. Currently flying the loop of the city in his dads old YT-2600 freighter. Accepting an urgent comm from his father, he was told to break atmosphere immediately. 

“Get as far from the planet as you can, Breton.” Dax said calmly. 
“Dad, what in... what’s going on?” Breton asked nervously. 
“Do as I say, Breton. Now.” 
Knowing not to disobey his father, especially with the tone he was displaying now, Breton pulled up, and the freighter sped into space.

“Punch it.” 
Dax said into the commlink. 

Breton saw a blinding red light streak past him.

His fathers last thoughts were of admiration...and love. 

As Breton pushed the throttle forward, he watched in silent horror as his home planet was torn to shreds. 

Streaks of light blew past him, and the ship made the jump.

Luke knows what Ben is doing. Tried to stop him. Then came to the realization that if he does he will doom the galaxy. So he basically hides himself so he’s not tempted to interfere. 

Seriously, watch the movie and think about this. A lot of things start to have totally different meanings. 

Basically Ben had a vision that he alone could stop the First Order. But to do so he had to do a lot of bad things. I would imagine Leia knows. Han maybe caught wind and didn’t like it.

What versions of each movie do you like the most?,"Star Wars has so many different versions across almost all of the movies, but these are the ones that I like the most for each movie. 
 

*TPM Theatrical Version*
This version was the one I first fell in love with as a kid, the dvd/Blu ray extended the pod race which made it so much worse and for some reason I prefer Creepy Puppet Yoda. 

*AOTC DVD Version*
Almost identical to the theatrical release. The Blu Ray reordered some scenes and made it more awkward than what it already was. 

*ROTS Theatrical Version*
It’s just the DVD version with a wipe instead of a cut on one scene. I don’t like change much and the few small things added to the Blu ray bug the crap out of me.  

*ANH 1997 Special Edition*
I know I know,  but hear me out. I love the color correction done on this release, I like Mos Eisley and the new effects, and I enjoy the Jabba scene with all of its bad cgi goodness. 

*ESB Blu Ray*
Every single change was so good and made ESB even greater as a part of the saga. Ian McDarmid as the Emperor, the redone Wampa scene, Cloud City looking beautiful, and the recomposited Hoth effects...beautiful! 

*ROTJ Despecialized*
Yeah the Special Editions for this was so bad, from the dance number to the sarlaac beak they felt so unnecessary and out of place. The original version for this is so great.

The good and bad of The Last Jedi from my point of view (Because apparently I'm a glutton for punishment.),"So I've recently rewatched The Last Jedi on Blu-Ray and I've come up with some thoughts. And because I apparently didn't learn my lesson the last time I posted about TLJ, I'm going to do it again.


Let's get the negative out of the way firsts.

**ADMIRAL HOLDO**

Let's get this out of the way, I am not labeling myself anti-SJW or sexist or any of that bull crap. I just see some flaws in her character. Don't get me wrong, her role in the story is important. Poe's arc needs for someone to butt heads with. And I completely support her decision to withhold the information of her plan from him. He just cost the Resistance a significant chunk of their fighters and all of their bombers, not to mention disobeyed direct orders. But the fact that even the bridge crew seemed skeptical of her actions means she withheld the info from them as well. We were given no indication of Holdo being paranoid enough to keep the highest ranking officials in the dark. Had they mentioned that, I would be a bit more satisfied with her character.

**FINN'S SUICIDE RUN**

This was just poorly handled altogether. The fact is, the way it's presented, Finn's stunt would have worked. The siege cannon would be disabled and bought the Resistance more time, and Finn would have finished his arc about finding something to fight for and not just running away. I've heard it said that the attack was supposed to be portrayed as futile. If that's the case, show the ski speeder take more damage than a busted blaster cannon.

**PHASMA'S DEMISE**

They should have kept the deleted scene. That's all I have to say.


In spite of my grumblings, I still enjoyed the movie. In fact I have a few stand out moments.

**KYLO AND REY'S BOND**

This was fun to watch unfold. Watching as they go from pure enemies to people who care about each other gave the movie heart. And it gave me a reason to feel sympathetic to the Knight of Ren (Seriously, though, we NEED more info on these guys.)

**THE HOLDO MANUVER**

I audibly giggled when the hyperspace ram went down. It was beautiful. And the silence definitely accentuated impact. As for if it invalidates all that came before, here's a tip from me to get more enjoyment out of these kinds of things. Instead of focusing at the reasons why something shouldn't work or seems to contradict prior canon, instead use it as a thought exercise to figure out how it *could* fit into canon. Speaking as a trekkie I tend to have to do this on a regular basis with that franchise. Trek has enough inconsistency to fill a mega-class star destroyer.

**LUKE'S FINAL STAND**

So, I'm a bit biased here due to an unusual circumstance. See, I caught wind of a spoiler that Kylo would slay Luke. So when the scene came, I expected Luke to be cut down. Boy was I surprised when he revealed that it was a projection. Seeing Luke best Kylo without even striking him was just perfect. And done like a *true* jedi master. ",StarWars,True,1524530429,2018-04-23
[SPOILERS] 2 ways I think would improve The Last Jedi and it contains 2 items: Kylo's helmet and Luke's lightsaber,"I like TLJ just fine but I feel like two objects in the movie could have made a difference far beyond the complaints of Holdo's plan and the bullshit on Canto Bight. 

The helmet of Kylo Ren. It is destroyed far too early after an outburst on the elevator after seeing Snoke. According to Wookiepedia the helmet was to hide his face FROM the First Order so no one knew his true identity as Ben. He should have kept it on in every scene EXCEPT for in his private room when he force communicates with Rey. After their fight with the Praetorians he should have given his speech about letting go of the past, the Jedi, the Sith, the Empire, the Republic, and smashed his helmet right there to show he is letting go of being in Vader's shadow. Would have made that speech much more powerful. 

The other is when Rey confronts Luke. After luke disarm a her once with the staff and she draws the saber Luke should have drawn his green saber and defended himself and disarmed her again. It should have been him over her saying ""This is not going to go the way you think"". Not only is it nostalgia but also a reminder that he is a master. Rey needs to taste something she has not felt before and that is defeat. It would give her much more characterization in that she STILL runs off to save Kylo just as Luke ran off in ESB believing in only hope.

Genius of Lucas,"To me perhaps one of the most iconic scenes in a New Hope is Obi-Wan’s and Lukes conversation when Luke receives his fathers lightsaber. While Lucas claims not to have thought about Vader being Lukes father, the dialogue still baffles me today it is so perfect and the expression on Alec Guiness Face is the Cherry on Top. 

Prehaps even greater was the mention of the clone wars in this scene. While we had no idea what the war was it allowed for Lucas to back track to then. This was a genius move just having seemingly made up history inserted into the movie.  
  
I wish this was done more, like i feel Lucas could have insert random comments in Revenge of the Sith if he knew he would visit the clone wars. I almost wish they inserted some dialogue about Anakin having a padowan when Anakin tells obi-wan from his point of view the Jedi are evil... Nothing too in depth...

Did Obi-Wan think Anakin/Vader was dead when he took and re-homed his kids?,"When Padme dies and the Jedi hide Luke and Leia, did they initially think that Anakin was dead (not from a certain point view, but literally dead)? I can't recall.

If they had known that Anakin was still alive, they arguably wouldn't have had the authority to steal the babies, since they're still his kids. Anakin being assumed dead removes that dilemma.

My Personal Canon(s),"Many fans like the idea of choosing which stories from a fictional universe to ignore and which stories to acknowledge. My method of doing this with my Star Wars fandom is to have three different continuities.

“Classic Canon” includes most material produced before TPM came out and Lucas began to flesh out the past of the Prequels. This mostly includes the original cuts of the OT, the classic Marvel Comics series, the Ballantine novels (or at least the ones that take place before Vision of the Future), and some of the Dark Horse comics such as Crimson Empire and Dark Empire.

“New Canon” is anything published after Disney’s reboot, as well as the current editions original 6 movies and TCW.

“Personal Canon” is the most nebulous one. Anything is eligible for this as long as it takes place between TPM and ROTJ. This canon includes the Clone Wars material published before the 2008 show (Tartakovsky’s CW series, Cestus Deception, Labyrinth of Evil, Republic Commando, etc.) in lieu of the 2008 stuff, much of which contradicted the previous material.

The Knights of the Old Republic and Dawn of the Jedi stuff exist in a vacuum for me, likely in all three canons to a degree. None of my canons include the Yuzzhan Vong War or SW: Legacy.

What about you folks? Do any of you have a personal method to determining what’s canon for you, or do you just defer to Lucasfilm for that stuff?",StarWars,True,1524585573,2018-04-24
Some things I wished happened in the Sequel films.,"1. Have Luke Skywalker training and failing Ben Solo be the main story. Luke doesn't have to try and kill him, Luke just has to fail at showing him another way from turning to the dark side. 

2. The Jedi should be looked down upon by the galaxy as they basically failed to defeat the Sith and allowed the Empire to be created. This should be a factor into the fall of Ben Solo.

3. Ben's obsession over Darth Vader should have been showcased more. He thinks Darth Vader and the dark side of the force are compelling him to turn, while Ben is conflicted about the fact that Vader redeemed himself. Ben worships the *idea* of Darth Vader.

4. Once Ben Solo becomes Kylo Ren, he and the Knights of Ren (who should be the other Jedi-in-training who willingly join him) should be the main antagonists of the series, along with the First Order. Speaking of...

5. The First Order would be way cooler if it was an evolved form of an leftover Imperial faction led by the blue man himself: Grand Admiral Thrawn. 

6. Snoke shouldn't exist. It should just be Kylo and the Knights of Ren betraying Luke and falling to the dark side themselves. 

7. Kylo Ren and his knights should join Thrawn and wage a guerrilla war against the New Republic (which should have also been showcased more) in order to restore the Empire. 

8. Kylo and his knights could also be trying to hunt down Luke Skywalker along with Han Solo and Leia. 

9. Have the First Order eventually be left with a single fleet. Maybe even kill off the First Order and Thrawn to really show the contrast in how the Rebels/New Republic is the overwhelming force against the tiny numbers of Kylo Ren, his knights, and the First Order.

The destruction of Alderaan has always kinda confused me,"So Tarkin gives Leia the choice of either having Alderaan destroyed, or the hidden rebel base. She then tells Tarkin the base is on Dantooine. He destroys Alderaan anyway and says ""Dantooine is far too remote for an effective demonstration"" Tarkin believes shes telling the truth with his later line ""she lied to us"". Is the ""effective demonstration"" he speaks of to be to show off the Death Star to the rest of the Galaxy? Wouldn't blowing up a sovereign planet give the rebellion a shit ton of support? I know he expects fear of the Death Star to keep the systems in check, but it seems a littke crazy. Or is it that Tarkin is simply a bad guy. Ive always been bad at picking up details like this in movies. 

This has confused since i first watched this movie 18 years ago.

"Tupac as Mace Windu, Michael Jackson as Jar Jar Binks: Star Wars Prequels could have been so wild.","Tupac reportedly auditioned for a Jedi role in Star Wars before the rapper's murder in 1996

Rick Clifford, a former engineer at Death Row Records said ""He was telling me that he was supposed to read for George Lucas and them. They wanted him to be a Jedi. I'm serious. Samuel L. [Jackson] got Tupac's part. [Tupac] said [to me], 'Old man, keep your fingers crossed.' He said, 'I've got three movies coming up. One of them, I've got to read for George Lucas.'""

And King of Pop wanted to play the most hated character of the prequel/best Sith Lord Jar Jar Binks. George Lucas denied Jackson because Jackson wanted to do it in prosthetics and makeup but Lucas wanted Jar Jar to be CGI.

Ahmed Best (Jar Jar actor) told Vice: ""Me, Natalie Portman and George [Lucas]'s kids – we were at Wembley arena at Michael Jackson's concert,"" Best said. ""We were taken backstage, and we met Michael. There was Michael and Lisa Marie [Presley]. George introduced me as 'Jar Jar,' and I was like, 'That's kind of weird.' Michael was like, 'Oh. OK.' I thought, 'What is going on? After Michael had driven off, we all go back up to a big after-party. I'm having a drink with George, and I said, 'Why did you introduce me as Jar Jar?' He said, 'Well, Michael wanted to do the part, but he wanted to do it in prosthetics and makeup like Thriller. George wanted to do it in CGI. My guess is ultimately Michael Jackson would have been bigger than the movie, and I don't think he wanted that.""

Imagine being in 1999 and having the first Star Wars movie in 15 years starring Tupac, one of the West Coast legends as a Master Jedi and Michael Jackson, King of Pop as an alien.

Just imagine Tupac vs Palpatine. Tupac in Battle of Geonosis against Dracula/Saruman. Tupac cutting Jango Fett's head. Tupac with a unique lightsaber maybe? (Samuel Jackson requested George Lucas the purple lightsaber).

Those of you who were unhappy with how Luke hid himself on an island. What reason can you think of that would make sense for his character to do that?,"I’ve been thinking of this every once in a while and I’m not entirely satisfied with his reasons for abandoning everyone. With Yoda and Obiwan it made sense for them to go into hiding because of Order 66. But for Luke? He failed his nephew and his temple got destroyed and unleashed a deadly force onto the galaxy. That is a big deal. But to give up? Is that essentially what he did? It just doesn’t add up to me. I’ve been trying to think of a better reason but keep coming up short. I might like the idea that instead he went to this island, the first jedi temple, to gain more wisdom and be able to come back a better Jedi and was maybe just unaware that they needed his help. Maybe he was cutting himself off from the force as a sort of training exercise and he was unable to connect with Leia. I really would have liked to see a proper Jedi Master Luke. Not some defeated old man. Failure is a lesson and I would have liked to see Luke more committed to learning from instead of just giving up entirely. ",StarWars,True,1524601185,2018-04-24

"[Opinion] For the sequel trilogy to truly fit into the OT and PT, Ben Solo NEEDS to survive in some capacity.","So the prequel trilogy and original trilogy both had clear, connecting stories they were trying to tell. The prequels were about the rise of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader and the fall of the Jedi, the original was about the return of the Jedi and the redemption of Anakin Skywalker by his son.

In the sequel trilogy, we're 2 movies in and the deeper meaning is still a bit more nuanced than the other trilogies(which is fine). On the surface, the new trilogy is about the return of the jedi again and the end of the first order, but that is a very simple concept and lacks the kind of deeper character essence that the other trilogies had, especially centered around the Skywalker name. 

If Episode 10 is as simple as Rey and the resistance defeating the first order, killing Kylo, and starting the new Jedi, it would fall flat in my opinion. It would feel boring and like ""What's the point?"" The key to making the whole thing work and fit within the trilogy is having Ben Solo survive and be redeemed to an extent.

I really hope we don't get a Vader-ala redemption arc where Kylo turns good to save the day but then ends up dying because:

1. We already saw that exact storyline in Vader and it would feel cheap.

2. Not the same, but we just had Luke ""redeem"" himself than die at the end of his arc.

Think about it, have we ever before seen a character in Star Wars that turns away from the darkside but stays alive doing so? I'm not saying he should turn into a ""good guy"" and marry Rey and all his sins are unpunished blah blah blah...but I think there are a lot of clever ways Disney could take a surviving Kylo. In fact, it would make for an extremely interesting story twist to see a bad character turn good and NOT be forgiven for all their sins just because they do one good deed. Turn him into an outlaw on the run or something, just let him survive so that the Skywalker story and the legacy of Anakin Skywalker doesn't end so...flat and straightforward.",StarWars,True,1524609883,2018-04-24
Episode IX (post-credits) epilogue,"I feel like it'd be really cool for them to do a post-credits epilogue, set a few hundred years into the future. By then, the new Force order (whatever it may end up being - Jedi, Grey Jedi, etc.) would be in full swing.

The only character left from the Skywalker saga is R2-D2. All the Force-sensitive students gather 'round the ancient droid as he tells of his experiences with the galaxy's most impactful (for better or for worse) family, the Skywalkers. 

R2 tells of how he met Padme Amidala, then embarked on missions during the Clone Wars with Anakin Skywalker, stumbled upon Anakin's son Luke years later, helped him defeat the Empire, years later witnessed his Jedi Temple be burned to the ground, and then it all culminated in the proper balance of the Force between light and dark/Rey and Ben... that last one is my personal theory... oops ;)

But anyway - of course we wouldn't actually hear him telling these stories, for time's sake. Perhaps it will be made known that that's what is happening, though, in the form of questions by the students.

Just thought it'd be a cool epilogue idea, inspired from the Legends story of how R2 was telling people about the Skywalkers 100 years after the OT. But in canon, it'd be awesome if this were to take place several hundred years in the future. That way we see how far the galaxy and its Force order have come.

If encountered so many people being nasty to people who like “The Last Jedi” due to “the plot holes that make the movie crap”. I disagree.,"I recently commented on another site about how I really liked “Star War: The Last Jedi” (that’s seriously all I said.) and, MY GOD did I piss off the alpha nerds.
I got a hell of a lot of “colorfully spoken” commentary about how wrong I was. 
I got a lot of, “They changed the established rules!” (They really didn’t.) and “There was too much humor for a Star Wars film. (Maybe. It’s not like the old movies had and really annoying comic relief characters or anything.) But the number one thing I’ve had people up my arse over are plot holes. There are apparently so many plot holes the movie is “unwatchable”. I mean to address some of these plot holes. Disclaimer: I’ve not researched these or anything (aside from looking up one fact, which I linked to) All this is just stuff I gathered from watching the film ONE WHOLE TIME.
First: the slow space chase everyone complains about even though it’s explained in the movie. “ Why didn’t they just blow them out of the sky?” Because they were faster and out of effective range of the destroyers. Meaning they couldn’t use short range fighters either because the big ships couldn’t lay down cover fire and they’re unshielded. The cruiser still had defensive guns. Also, Hux likes to be dramatic.
Then there’s Leia using the force to pull herself through space. It was established she had force potential in ROTJ and, although untrained (or maybe she was, we don’t know!), it wouldn’t take much strength to move through a vacuum. As for surviving in space, a human can survive about 15 seconds. http://amp.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/08/can_you_survive_in_space_without_a_spacesuit.html 
Considering the short time she was out there, and with that sci-fi space magic the force instinctually helping, it’s feasible she survived. (Plus it did almost kill her. That’s important.)
“Why didn’t Holdo just tell Poe her plan to begin with?” Maybe because it’s established he can’t keep his mouth shut. He leaked BB-8 having the Skywalker map in TFA. And it was him telling Finn and Rose Holdo’s plan over Commlink while KNOWING an untrustworthy stranger was present that led to all those rebel deaths anyway. He’s been with the resistance a while. They know he has loose lips.
Obi Wan says to Yoda, “That Boy is our last hope.” To which Yoda replies, “No, there is another.” If he’s referring to Leia that doesn’t make any goddamn sense because if Luke stays with Yoda, Leia dies. Vader already has her and they know it.  (Oh wait, that’s not TLJ, that’s ESB, the undisputed best movie in the series. Oops.)
And the most common one I’ve heard about: “Why don’t they use ‘The Holdo Maneuver’ more often if it’s so wildly effective?”
Why don’t Navy Admirals use their Aircraft Carriers as battering rams? For one thing, the ship was empty except for Holdo and that’s a rare case. Also, a giant ass space ship is Hella expensive, I’d wager. And so is a hyper drive for those suggesting missiles (and hard to aim, probably). Lasers are free. Most importantly though, it wasn’t that effective compared to other weapons in the Star Wars universe. Everyone or nearly everyone not in the immediate impact area survived and escaped to fight another day. That’s not worth the cost of a battle cruiser and an Admiral in a normal situation.
I know these are only possible explanations and they aren’t the only plot holes, but as a fan I’ve come to realize EVERY Star Wars movie is full of plot holes. My opinion is to just accept it and let people enjoy things instead of filling every forum with seething hatred.
Thanks for letting me rant.
Edit: I’ve. The titles supposed to start with “I’ve”. Dammit.",StarWars,True,1524612975,2018-04-24
Is being Force sensitive a terrible fate to inflict on someone?,"I keep hearing this meme a lot over the over years but I wonder how much of this is actually true? The Force isn't some malevolent entity that makes everyone's lives miserable however it seems like some games or even other stories, it seems like it is the Force users who are portrayed as the ones who cause trouble for everyone. I might be wrong about this but why this even a thing? Are there other ways to interpret the Force? ",StarWars,True,1524614018,2018-04-24
I just had an epiphany and I think I now know why Kyle Ren’s lightsaber crystal is cracked,"I think it’s important to go with what has been revealed in canon as a foundation. 

My theory on his cracked focus Crystal is based on two things we know in canon. **First** is the conflicted nature of Kylo Ren, and the **second** is the process by which a dark side user turns an existing light saber crystal red.

First of all, let’s remember that we already know that when a dark side user builds a light saber and takes a crystal from a conquered enemy, The reason that the crystal turns a crimson color is that the dark side user literally makes the crystal bleed as it forces the crystal to bend its will to his.

**Kylo Ren’s cracked light saber crystal is a testament to the conflicted nature within him.**

My theory is that his light saber crystal reflects him perfectly and the very process by which he created his new lightsaber. 

Do you remember when he proclaims that his old self was “weak and foolish like his father” so he destroyed him? He knew that wasn’t true. Adam driver delivered this line beautifully. You can hear the desperate plea to himself that it has to be true. **His proclamation was another desperate attempt to fool himself into believing that Ben Solo was dead.** After he burned the Jedi Temple, he took the light saber of Ben Solo - his old “conquered“ self. He hadn’t defeated and snuffed out the light within himself. He was simply trying to convince himself that he had. I think his complete turn to the dark side was too soon. He thought his master had tried to kill him and so he ran away in fear. He turned himself over to the dark side because he felt like he had no other choice at that point. It was time to jump off the fence.

When a dark side user creates a red crystal, it’s done using a existing light saber crystal from a conquered enemy, as we saw in the new comic series about Darth Vader creating his Sith light saber.  **Except Ben Solo wasn’t conquered**. It creates conflict and anguish in Kylo Ren to this day. When he frustratingly yells “no, you’re still holding on!“ To Rey, you can hear the desperation in his voice because he knows all too well the consequences of not fully committing to the path you decide to go on.  Snoke was very insightful when he declared that when he killed his father that the deed split his spirit to the bone.

So now you have an **imbalanced, indecisive boy who is trying to pretend he is something that he really isn’t.** He’s holding the light saber crystal of Ben Solo. He channels all of his malice, his hatred, his resentfulness of his mother and uncle and his distant father. He was a boy with all the anger issues of an adolescent **but with none of the reasons and true conviction of a real dark side user. He was simply going through the motions trying to make himself believe in the path.** He had love. He had family. Still he persisted, attempting to bend the will of his old light saber crystal. But you cannot fool the force as easily as you can fool yourself. The weight of his imbalance, all came crashing down on this inanimate object, splitting his lightsaber crystal into two halves of a single crystal trying to be two things at once — just like the boy trying to be two different things.

Everything about his dark side life is more about trying to convince himself. The mask. The cracked crystal. The lies he tells himself that he destroyed Ben Solo. The murder of his own father. **None of these things served any purpose other than to try and convince himself that he’s something that he is not,** and is crackling light saber is a physical reminder and testament to his conflicted soul.

TL;DR - He took his original Jedi crystal and tried to turn it into a crimson dark side light saber crystal but he couldn’t do it right because he was too conflicted, causing his crystal to crack in the process.",StarWars,True,1524615023,2018-04-24

Rank these Star Wars heroes from best to worst pilot.,"So I was thinking the other day, basically every hero is a good pilot. Luke is great. Han is great. Rey is great.

* Han
* Leia
* Chewie
* Poe
* Wedge
* Rey
* Ben/Kylo
* Anakin

Republic droids versus separatist clones.,"Watching clone wars right now (no spoilers please) and one thing I've been thinking is Sidious set the chess board up and was playing both sides.  So what if he set up the war so that the clones and clone technology were the main force of the separatists and the jedi and republic were reinforced by droids.

First thought was, it would be much darker. Seeing Jedi slice through waves of clones is more jarring than when they do it to droids. Even if they are simply grown as tools of war.

Which brings me to my second point. Was this the case simply because Jedi were more likely to throw themselves in danger for the sake of clones as opposed to droids. They certainly still treat them like people. One of the goals of the war was to weaken the Jedi enough to execute order 66 effectively. In Kotor 2 if you talk to HK 47 about ways to kill Jedi he specifically mentions putting allies in danger to lure jedi into doing something stupid. Im not sure if KoToR is canon or not but the concept is still valid. So in war if your goal is to kill jedi and make it seem as collateral damage it would make most sense to stick them on the side of clones as opposed to droids since aside from a few like R2 there doesnt seem to be the willingness to sacrifice.

Either side could have easily been a valid standing force for the eventual empire but I'm curious just how differently things could have played out if the chess board were switched around a bit.",StarWars,True,1524623086,2018-04-24

It's better to have an egotistical fool with heart in charge than an empty suit. George Lucas is honestly kinda awesome.,"George Lucas isn't that bad. 

Yeah, just like everybody else, I watched the Plinkett reviews. They were undoubtedly entertaining but they had the unfortunate effect of tainting my prior love for the prequel films, which I watched as an 8 year old boy. 

Goodness, what a time to grow up as a little boy. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Pokemon every Saturday. I had an endless pool of material to fuel my imagination. 

All these films sold me a fantasy. I could be a Pokemon trainer, or wizard, or a Jedi Palawan like Anakin Skywalker (clone wars Anakin, not phantom menace Anakin.) 

Back to Star Wars: Rarely has a film made me feel the way I felt while watching Yoda stride on screen to face off against Count Dooku, or the execution stadium on Geonosis.

I felt none of that magic while watching the sequel films. That magic which is hard to describe and impossible to create through sheer funding. It's something you know when you see it. They felt like your generic marvel action hero movie. Dull, and made by an empty suit. 

George Lucas is probably an egotistical maniac and maybe a little bit crazy but at least he is passionate. A passionate, ego-driven man. 

I can feel the passion put into the prequels, and while not always well-executed, the magic is still there. ",StarWars,True,1524631607,2018-04-25

An Alternate Version of The Last Jedi (Very Long Post),"Okay. Before anyone jumps the gun, I wanna be clear: I personally didn't like a majority of The Last Jedi. Not because of Star Wars lore or standards nitpicks, though I did have plenty of those too, but mostly narrative and filmmaking issues. What I propose here isn't a ""better"" version of The Last Jedi, but merely, something I think would satisfy more of the fanbase. Not watered down, not Star Wars-ified, but what to me, would make more sense from a storytelling perspective, from a Star Wars perspective, from an EU-fan's perspective. To appease and appeal to the most of all of us. It isn't complete, and it isn't everything.

I think there are some good ideas here. Take from it what you will.
Also, not everything is listed in chronological or scene order. Just a blueprint.

If you like it, great, if not, no big deal.
Just know that I'm not looking for criticism, praise, agreement, or disagreement. The comments section is yours. (And I hope this doesn't start a trend, because I don't wish to cause a flooding of such things on the sub. I know how annoying that can be.)
Without further ado.


Opening crawl states that it has been several weeks or months since the destruction of the New Republic, and the First Order have been obsessively chasing after the Resistance following the assault on Starkiller base, while the planetary governments are furiously trying to maintain peace and are unable to make a stand against the First Order and help the Resistance ""fleet"". During one such skirmish between jumps, the ace pilots Poe Dameron and (whatever Rose's sister's name was) Tyco managed to cripple the First Order's Command Dreadnaught, giving the Resistance a brief reprieve as they begin to make their way to an old Rebel Alliance base on the planet Krait.

Show that people are tense on board the main Resistance command ship, fuel is still depleting but isn't an emergency just yet, but will be soon. Rose is much younger in this version, somewhere around the age of 16 or 17, and show a lengthy scene of her and her sister interacting wherever they room on the ship, and give a little visual and verbal exposition about how Rose was always the brainier of the two and better with tech while being more introverted and scared, while her sister was more the gung-ho courageous type, and is an ace pilot always ready for action. (Maybe have her and Poe be hinted at having a bond deeper than just fellow soldiers that may be going in a romantic direction. Not a needed addition, but dealer's choice there.)

Don't cut to Rey and Luke at their first meeting, instead show Rey going about her training activities solo, on one of the smaller nearby islands in a lengthy montage, before she goes to bed, showing that her power has grown and she's putting in the effort to control it, and that she sees glimpses of visions when she rests, of the past present and future, including their first meeting, which goes down VERY differently and exnays on the lightsaber-chuck gag. Luke is still begrudging about training Rey, and change his purpose for coming here as looking for answers that the ancient Jedi might have had about the Dark Side, the balance, etc. That, when he ""failed"", he questioned whether he was or was not truly a Jedi Master, that there was more he needed to know and lacked (however, as time progressed, the simple life, much like his own on Tatooine before his first adventure, has slowly creeped back in and he has become disillusioned and complacent, which the movie did kinda try to portray but not well), but has not found these answers. Rey coming into play, presenting him with his old lightsaber, his father's old lightsaber, shatters this, and it takes him time to put it together.
Then have a vision of Snoke, who in this version can either be Plagueis or is merely a puppet of an Embodiment of the Dark Side (not necessarily The Son from Mortis, but more like Abeloth) reaching out trying to find her. She wakes up, frightened, and Luke enters, having sensed it. They talk, he exposits a bit about ultimately deciding to train her, stating that he realized with words of wisdom from a strange old hermit, that the answers came not from where it began, but where it must go, and that he thinks Rey will play a role in that. (Training and teaching Rey is the redemption Luke realizes he needs, not this isolation and study)

Much of the movie's events play out similarly; Finn wakes up from his medically induced coma, his body recovering to the point where he can get back on his feet, albeit weakly and in struggle (as opposed to the goofy slapstick), he talks things out, albeit aggressively, demanding to know where Rey is, what's going on, etc. He accepts the fact that she's someplace safe for now, and visually we see he wishes badly to message her and make sure she's alright, but cannot. Add in some bits where any communication that has been sent out from the Resistance to planets they are near go either unanswered or the planets are so scared of risking the wrath of the First Order, or they have way too much on their plate in keeping panic and hysteria down, that they are unable to give any aid. Fuel is going to run low, with only enough to maybe make one more jump from each ship. A meeting of the leaders of the Resistance is called.

Cut to show that Phasma is indeed very much alive, having barely managed to escape Starkiller base with a ship that was damaged and marooned her on a very hostile but uninhabited world (without sentient humanoids I mean), her armor is damaged, but we're shown that she obsessively polishes it; she is seeking out possible hideouts that the Resistance may look to find refuge in, going over the figures and calculations of lightspeed jumps, until she figures out that there /is/ a pattern to them, and old Clone Wars era ploy used by Mon Calamari once they were liberated by the Republic (being a military career-ed warrior, Phasma would have studied such things, we'll suggest), and the end point: Krait. She uses her rebuilt ship on whatever planet she has since used as homebase, and she fires off to jump to Krait and begin searching for them. (The main focus on Phasma is that she feels disgraced, and she will ensure before she returns to the First Order, that she will have proven herself worthy of returning to her position. Also, make sure to never show her face directly without her helmet on.)

Eventually, the Resistance will make the jump to just outside of the system Krait is in, hoping to coast their way towards the planet, but they will send several volunteers on a mission to collect more fuel and hopefully, some allies. Finn and Poe gladly sign up, as well as the Tycos, albeit Rose goes along to stay close to her sister and at her sister's request.
They arrive in the system's edge, power down enough to coast, and the four depart for a spaceport in-system.
Remove Canto Bight as a whole, but have a SMALL, very small moment where we see Rose interact with an animal like the ones in the movie, and how she's only seen holos of them, and they're beautiful to her, that it's a shame they lock them up like this, and they all have a moment where they talk about how you have to take a stand, to fight for what you believe in, or nothing ever changes. Finn sees himself in a way in Rose, being ""machine-like"" with introversion, not being able to be himself when he was with the First Order, too afraid to be an individual, and he does something crazy warmhearted and frees the animal. Nothing spectacular or grand, but a quiet, sweet scene (the owner of the creature is pissed, but Finn gets aggressive with him, either with a blaster or grabs him and pins him to a wall, letting his combat instincts guide him), and he or Rose accidentally drops the info they're Resistance to him, and he runs off.
They find fuel at the port from a dealer, B. deltoro's character, who's still a snake in the grass, plays all sides kinda guy. He's made aware they're Resistance, and it seems like he's going to betray them, but apparently is ""on their side"" (when in fact he isn't and betrays them/rats them out like in the movie).

Phasma finds the fleet, sends word to the First Order, is reinstated by Snoke himself via transmission, and goes to the spaceport to track down the stragglers.

Phasma is waiting for them at their ship, tipped off by Deltoro's character's message to the First Order, an action packed shootout battle commences, Rose's sister dies in the fight, Phasma fights with Finn and it's just part one of their resolution, as neither wins nor loses, as an explosions separates them and they manage to fly the ship out of the port and make tracks back to the fleet; thanks to some clever quick tech work by Rose, who in light of losing her sister, her sacrifice, has gained her own fiery courage, and takes a stand following Finn's and her sister's examples.

The First Order show up in-system, a space battle commences, the Fuel crew team get back barely, and now it's a race to the planet. (The First Order command ship still can't move as quickly as the Resistance fleet, but more ships are jumping into the system at various positions and angles)

Meanwhile, Rey has another vision amidst her trainings, and it's of the impending doom that will face the Resistance: Kylo Ren. She and Luke discuss her leaving, Luke warning her, speaking from experience, but she is as determined as he was; Luke looks to his submerged X-Wing and recounts ""...if you're going to go... you /won't/ be going alone.""
(Bear in mind, we still have similar discussions and lessons between them like in the movie, but more ""hey, Master, what about this?"" or ""Why did the Jedi do this?"" things like that.)

But where's Kylo Ren been? Well, since Snoke dismissed him until he proves himself worthy, as a true disciple of the Dark Side, he has put himself through Hell. Similarly to Phasma, he's been on a horrid world: Korriban. While there, he has learned from Sith Spirits, he has faced lethally dangerous creatures corrupted by the Dark Side, and he has truly become a Sith Lord; however, he is still haunted by the murder of his Father at his hands, Snoke's rebukes still ringing in his mind.
All the while, the same strange connection between Rey and Kylo take place, though Luke is unaware, yet he senses some connection Rey has going on that seems familiar. (They're more subtle this time, not as dramatic as in the movie.)

Kylo Ren sees a vision much like Rey has, of the Resistance going to Krait, a base he was at for a while as a child with his parents, and that there he will find his ultimate destiny: one way, or another. And he leaves for Krait.

At many lives and a high cost, including Ackbar taking command of a smaller Resistance cruiser and slamming it into the commandship dreadnaught to slow down the incoming fleet, they manage to get to the base on Krait. When those large doors open, for the first time, we see Kylo Ren without his helmet in this movie: the scars he sustained deforming him slightly, he no longer needs to wear the helmet, as his inside matches the out. We see the Grandson of Vader unleash his power. He assaults the Resistance, the groundforces of the First Order are landing, attacks will soon come from both sides, and as Kylo attacks again, Leia steps in, saber blazing in hand, fending him off as best she can, making a remark of ""Luke taught me as well, son..."" It's clear her son is no more. They battle, Kylo Ren furious with his mother, accusing her of abandonment and failing to protect those closest to her (we're led to believe in reference to his corruption by Snoke and leaving him with Luke to be trained), though Kylo has clear advantage. She is fatally wounded but not instantly killed. As he goes in for the killing blow, he and Leia react to a sudden tremor in the Force.

The Falcon and T-65 X-Wing scream in from the sky, destroy the ground forces of the First Order, and Kylo Ren is in such shock that he ignores his mother completely as he walks towards the wasteland of a planet. The Resistance and First Order clash on the ground, using the old Rebel Alliance's defensive weapons, thanks to Rose's quick work, keep that side of the battle even, while Finn and Phasma also have their final duel, with Finn finally killing her and throwing off his chains of fear and following his own path, as opposed to that which the First Order programmed him to be. (Mind you, this death isn't meant to be cold blooded murder; it could be played up as he lets her live, and attacks Poe to try and bait Finn into it, it could be played around with a lot).
Poe tries to see to Leia's wounds, but it's clear she won't make it.
Luke and Rey land, they have a brief dialogue, as a shuttle also lands: Snoke himself has arrived. He is impressed by Kylo Ren, grants him the title of Darth (not sure what name, Caedus would be a nice nod but not needed). The battle commences, Luke and Rey versus Kylo and Snoke (think of the Old Republic trailer with the two Jedi vs the two Sith)
During the fight, Snoke taunts Rey's parentage, until he reveals that she is in fact, the daughter of Han and Leia, the sister of Ben Solo.
It's revealed that during one of their adventures, she went missing when the Falcon was stolen from Han. He and Leia spent years looking for her, but never did. This broke Ben'd heart, his twin (non-identical) sister lost forever. It was this that drove him, to find her again. To get the power his grandfather had, to search for her through the Force, and bring her home. This was the lure Snoke had dangled for Ben all those years ago: to get the power to find her, to make the galaxy secure so that families wouldn't be torn apart again by embracing the Dark Side, that only the Sith could rule the galaxy, like his Grandfather had. While Ben suspected Rey might be her, he couldn't be sure. But in this moment, two things happen:
Rey is overcome with fury at Ben: he killed their father, HER father, and likely killed her mother.
Ben, on the other hand, has come at the end of his search: and it didn't require the Dark Side to achieve it. And Snoke had known, had know all along where she was, and never told him. The tide of the battle shifts, Kylo trying to defend himself from Rey, and trying to attack Snoke, Luke attacking Snoke and trying to keep Rey from embracing the Dark Side.
Snoke is severely wounded by Luke, but not killed.
Utter chaos, as Leia looks on, tears streaming, as she calls out her daughter's name with her dying breath (Jaina, or whatever other name works best), Rey looking at her in that last moment, and seeing her die from Kylo's wounds. She snaps. The Dark Side erupts from her, Snoke watches, speaking of how his Master will be pleased, Luke looks on in utter horror at the revelation of Snoke referring to an embodiment of the Dark Side as his master.
A massive explosion of Force energy ends the battle. Snoke and Rey depart, as Rey has turned to the Dark Side, and seeks to forge her own path as she chooses, renounces her lineage as a Skywalker, as a Solo, as a Jedi.
Luke digs through the rubble and finds Ben, wounded but alive, now redeemed, but ridden with guilt. Luke speaks of how nothing can change the terrible things he has done, but like his own failings, like his father and Ben's grandfather, there is always hope. He looks to Leia's body, unaffected by the Force explosion, tears running down his face with a sad smile, and remarks how ""she always gave this galaxy hope, that it can change. That you, could change. Now, we have to do our part.""

My Origin theory for Supreme Leader Snoke,"Yet another ""who is snoke"" observation but...

I believe he's one of the many powerful semi-apprentices that Palpatine sent to usurp Darth Vader.

Snoke got his wounds from his subsequent confrontation with Vader, failed in his attempt on Vader's Life, was bested, mutilated and either left for dead by Vader or intentionally left alive by Vader for some degree of lasting suffering.
  
After the Battle of Endor is where he gets amped.  The line ""Darkness rises and Light to Meet it"" is critical here.   

After the Battle of Endor, the last remaining powerful force user in the galaxy is Luke Skywalker.  The force was looking for a vessel and one of the few trained and powerful force users was the rehabbing Snoke in the Unknown regions.   Light rose and Dark to meet it.   Balancing the force. 

With his force steroids and training from Palpatine he was able to show his worth and power to the young First Order who desperately wanted to become what the former Galactic Empire had been.  They had found their emperor.

This also shows why Snoke is obsessed with Vader and his power and trying to recreate it as his own tool of destruction and shows his own weaknesses by seeking out the Vader bloodline rather than seeking out a possibly more capable student than Kylo Ren is.

The Throne Room in TLJ would be a full-circle moment where the man who was bested by Vader was once again bested by his obsession with Vader and even killed by Vader's own lightsaber.

What if Anakin isn't actually that good of a pilot????,"This sounds crazy. Anakin/Vader was supposed to be the best fighter pilot of his era. But then how did he fail to react to Han Solo's sneak attack, who is driving a frieghter? We see him foil all other starfighters in previous conflicts.....
I think that Anakin is actually a shit pilot, and R2-D2 was actually piloting the ship the entire time, at every single battle Anakin was in. R2-D2 was trying to save the Galaxy from darkness by convincing Anakin he was a good pilot, trying to give the poor kid a sense of worth. Like, I understand that the kid built a podracer, but podracing skills on a relatively 2 Dimensional track probably don't transfer over to star fighter skills, which makes me wonder how Anakin was even able to survive the Space Battle of Naboo. R2 did it.  In the clone wars, Anakin temporarily loses R2, and replaces him with Goldie. In a later conflict with his Twilight frieghter, he struggles against some fights or something I think. The same goes for Luke.  The only reason he survived the death star was because of R2. You see him in the battle of hoth, where he fails to do anything effective in the battle of hoth, which is much more similar than an x-wing to his original skyhopper. And guess who wasn't with him on hoth? That's right. R2.",StarWars,True,1524665752,2018-04-25

Is Yoda the worst Jedi in history?,"I just saw this on Quora and was interested in opinions:

There is a very good argument to be made that Yoda was actually one of the worst Jedi in history.

Powerful in the Force indeed Yoda was, but never has it been said that pure power is what makes a Jedi great!

Yoda lived over 900 years, and trained Jedi for over 800 of them. It isn’t clear how many years he spent as Grand Master of the Jedi Council, but he must have been highly influential in the Order for centuries.

And those centuries coincided with the decline and downfall of the entire Order. Everything bad about the Jedi Order in the Prequels, everything that led them inexorably to their ruin, their rigidity, their failure to manage attachment, their fear of the Dark Side that led them to their most egregious mistakes, the arrogance and self-righteousness that blinded them to the truth until it was too late, all of that happened under his watch. He either made it happen, allowed it to happen, or did not fix when he inherited it from his predecessors.

He was the Little Green Friend in charge. The buck stopped with him. And he dropped the ball big time.

Wise, they say he was? How wise, really? Wise enough to be played like a fiddle by Palpatine, time and again? Wise such that his advice to Anakin on dealing with his fears of loss was worse than useless? So wise that Luke only triumphed by ignoring half of what he told him? Wise enough to voice, time and again, vague reservations about general courses of action, and yet not once ever do anything to actually change those actions? (When as Jedi Grand Master he had all the power in the Galaxy to do just that?)

A great teacher he was? He supposedly trained lots of Jedi, but of the only two students explicitly stated to have ben instructed by him before Luke, one became a freaking Sith Lord, and the other one ended up training a freaking Sith Lord. And if Luke hadn’t explicitly disobeyed him in ESB, Luke probably would have ended up a freaking Sith Lord too (or dead). And if he did have a hand in the training of other Prequel Era Jedi, like Mace “they’re all too dangerous to be left alive” Windu, well the actions of those Jedi do not reflect well on their teacher at all….

If the Dark Side is about the aggrandizement of the Self, and the Light Side about the subservience of the Self for the greater good, then surely the truest measure of a Jedi’s quality is he left the galaxy around him a better place than it had been before him.

And on this count, if it were not for Luke cleaning up his mess, Yoda failed in every imaginable way, and his great power only made the consequences of his many mistakes all the more terrible.

On this scale, Yoda has been less successful as a Jedi than even Ezra Bridger….",StarWars,True,1523560998,2018-04-12

Don’t you think Lucas really tainted Chewie’s character in Episode III?,"So in the grand galaxy of Star Wars, Yoda just happened to have met both Luke and Chewie on independent occasions decades apart? The coincidence of this is just ridiculous. 

Not only that, but Chewie’s depiction in Episode III is this noble ambassador loyal to the Jedi and the Republican authority. That’s not who Chewie is supposed to be prior to A New Hope! He’s a smuggler and a scoundrel who, like Han, learned a lesson in ANH about the importance of joining a greater cause against evil; leaving behind a life of self-interest and personal gain.

The only thing that now interests me about Chewie in Episode III is how close he is to the age of 190!

Lucas shoehorned Chewie into the movie as a lame attempt at fan service. I refuse to consider this canon! There better be no mention of this creative choice in “Solo”.

"After TLJ, how can Poe, Finn, and Rose show their faces at all, let alone lead?","I re-watched The Last Jedi, and I was shocked by how little criticism Poe, Finn, and Rose got for their actions which were (a) insubordinate, (b) stupid, and (c) had absolutely disastrous, lethal consequences.

Specifically, they have a conversation about the transports -- an unbelievably sensitive military secret -- in full earshot of a completely unknown quantity, namely Benicio del Toro. This results in the deaths of an uncounted number of people -- hundreds? thousands?  

But once they rejoin the group, nobody screams at them. Nobody strips them of all rank. Nobody seems bothered at all by what they did.

It's a bit disturbing, no?

I didn't really notice it when I was watching the movie the first time because all this different stuff was happening. But when I sat down and watched it again, I thought, ""Wow, all these horrible consequences are completely and utterly their fault -- apparently including the death of a certain very central, long-running character -- and they have no excuse."" 

Perhaps nobody is bothered because their actions were required to keep the plot moving along to where the writers wanted it to go. But for the characters in the reality of the movie, the utter lack of shame from these characters doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.

Regarding a childhood heroes fate (Spoiler),"I know that I am in the minority saying this, but I really enjoyed TLJ. Despite its flaws like hyperspace ramming, the whole casino plot the humor (perhaps my biggest criticism) I really liked the film. This might be because I really didnt like TFA as I thought it brought nothing new and original into the franchise and I didnt like the characters. With the new film that twisted almost everything, I think that especially Rey and Kylo got way more interesting. 
But my favorite aspect of the movie was, how he treated Luke.
Now, I have to say that I grew up with the prequels and Clone Wars and not so much with the OT, so I might not have the same attachment as some older fans have but I think there was one major problem with Luke and how TFA sat him up: He stood in the way of the Story of the new trilogy. The first movie was all about finding him and he was so important both to the fans and the characters, that he would have overshadowed them. And I think he already did that in this film. Every scene with him I could only watch him and I am not even that attached to him. And that is the problem, because the new trilogy is about Rey and Kylo, and they shouldnt be overshadowed by anything. So we need to find a way around that. We could keep him In the back and have very few interaction with him, but I think nobody would be happy about that. Or we could keep him around and have him stay in the way of the story just for fanservice, which might please some, but at least I would not like that as the whole story is more important for me. The last option would be killing him off or letting him disappear. I think we can all agree that the last thing wouldnt make sense so we need to find a way to kill him that would fit his development. Luke struggled with the dark side again and again and we have seen this in Return of the Jedi and in the last Jedi. But the important thing here is, that he was able to resist it, even though it was to late in Kylos case and Kylo was already the ""scared young boy"" because he thought that his master betrayed him. But in reality, he didnt do that, and thats why I do not think that TLJ destroyed his character. But that would have done this, would be killing him off in some simple way. Do you really want your childhood hero just struck down by a lightsaber? Do we really want Obi-Wan 2.0?  Do we really want him to be killed at all? When I walked into the movie, I was afraid that that would happen. And when I walked, I thought that they found a great way for Luke. In the end, his bond with the force was stronger than ever and he peacefully got one with it, while saving his friends on the way. I dont think it was the force projection that killed him, I just think that his journey was over. It begun under the twin suns and it ended under them and I think that was the best way to end Lukes journey because a simple death would not feel appropriate to his character.

So, this post got much longer than I wanted it to be and I apologize for any mistakes as I am not a native speaker and its late over here. Please kepp in mind that all of this is my own opinion and feel free to share yours with me.

Did anyone else despise Vice Admiral Holdo?,"No matter how many times I rewatch this movie my disdain for Holdo continues to grow. I just cannot bring myself to see things from her view and I consider myself a pretty open minded person. As reckless as Poe and Finn’s and Rose’s actions were, Holdo’s were in direct contradiction to what Leia’s words actually meant. She was, as Poe said, a coward and a traitor for simply giving up when things got hard. ",StarWars,True,1523576745,2018-04-12
Please read this. It's about the state of the community.,"First offs, I'm sorry if this is a bit rambly - I'm just lying in bed trying to get my thoughts out 😂. After watching Star Wars Theory's latest video, I really felt like I needed to ask everyone here. Please read the whole thing.

So before reading this I would recommend reading the comments of SWT's video:

https://youtu.be/JcjRqZX0o6I

The problem wasn't with the video itself - I am actually a big fan of SWT's work. The problem is with the comments.

Just look at the comments. Nearly every. Single. One. is bashing on Disney and absolutely hating on the sequels and TLJ.

Where to start? Ah - The Last Jedi. I'm sure other people have posted more on this so I'll keep it brief. I went to see the film a day after release with 2 friends and having finished the movie one of my friends just straight up said, 'the Last Jedi is now one my FAVOURITE films of all time - up there with TSB.' I mean, we all felt the same way. It was just brilliant. And although many people don't feel as strongly about it as we did - that's fine. But I felt there was too much unnecessary hate coming its way. In fact, Jenny Nicholson sums it up brilliantly in her video 10 Worst Reasons you Hate The Last Jedi where she counters TLJ hate very well. 

https://youtu.be/JpoUN_A12Eg

I would like to add a few more things on. Having read the comments on SWT's video I saw that people were concerned about Luke's portrayal in TLJ. But I'm sorry - what other logical course could they have taken with Luke? He said it himself - he didn't exile himself and go to the most undiscoverable place just to go back because some girl gave his lightsaber back. Also, she was seen bonding with Kylo Ren and he didn't want to help a girl who he thought would turn to the dark side. And if Luke was a prominent character in TFA then that would completely reduce the role of the new characters and the new heroes in the galaxy as well as give a much less compelling plot. 

That segways brilliantly onto my next point. The Original Trilogy. This was actually the main reason I felt in need to write this. As I quote from a YouTube comment on SWT'S video, 

""If I was Mark Hamill I would definitely leave Star Wars after the force awakens, it's not the same Star Wars it used to be. They shouldn't be trying to kill off the original characters, I feel like they should have left them all alive in the end. Also, why bring back the original characters if they just make them the bad guy and kill them off, Disney f***ed up the Star Wars universe, should have just been continued with Star Wars legends.""

And this is what I'm talking about. Nostalgia has made people blind and now they are clinging onto the remains of the OT instead of appreciating new, fresh characters in the same universe with the OT characters supporting them until they die. You can't just have the same characters over and over again! Heck, it was Harrison Ford who wanted Han to die. It is also well known that the prequels get a lot of hate. Again, not original trilogy yada yada yada.

Having watched all 8 movies a countless number of times. I still do not get where the hate for the prequels and the sequels are coming from. As movies I think they are brilliant and add so much depth to the Star Wars universe.

If you claim to be a Star Wars fan and hate anything that is not the OT or other SW TV series's then SHAME ON YOU. 

I didn't think there would be many of these people but having read all the YouTube comments, I guess I was wrong. 

So that's why this is a discussion. Are you one of these people? And how many of these people do you know? If you got to the end then thank you so much &lt;3

Having said this I do admire most parts of the community - this was an issue I needed to talk about.

Edit: Yes there were definitely things I didn't like in the Last Jedi like Rose but I still did like the film.",StarWars,True,1523577773,2018-04-12
What order to show GF Star Wars,"Tl;dr - I got a GF and want advice on the best order to show her Star Wars

Hey guys, I’m a pretty big Star Wars fan. I wouldn’t call myself crazy, but I’ve seen all the films, all of the animated stuff, and done some of my own research into broader topics. I like the universe

I recently got a girlfriend, and for our first date I took us to see TLJ. She enjoyed it, and has asked for me to show her another one. I’m coming at this hoping I’ll be able to show her all the live action films eventually, so I was wondering what orders I could use. I’ve heard of the machete order, but was wondering if there were more, and also how to fit Rogue One in, especially.

A thought on the argument of young vs old force ghost Anakin in ROTJ.,"I’m sure this topic has been argued to death as to whether it makes sense or not for Anakin to be young at the end of ROTJ. But is there anything canonically that says the ghost can’t just choose how they want to look?

If not. I think the best thought is to just assume Anakin is choosing to appear young, and Yoda and Obi are choosing to appear old. ",StarWars,True,1523578128,2018-04-12

I just finished Heir to the Empire and I have Thoughts™,"The Sequel Trilogy was, in as much as it coukd be for anyone, my entry to the Star Wars franchise. So I was very much interested in reading the ""unofficial"" Episodes VII-IX to compare and contrast. Originally I intended to do one of these for each book comparing it to the respective movie but I'm no longer sure that would be prudent. (General EU Spoilers to follow)

The biggest takeaway I have is that Timothy Zahn has a much better grasp of the military aspect of Star Wars than the films. But in equal measure the films (and Rebels) handle the ""spiritual"" side of the franchise much better than these books so far. For every laser with bullet drop or downward-propelled bomber payload in the movies there's a ""Jedi Hibernation Trance"" or Anti-Force lizards in the books. And I know Luuke is right around the corner. None of these things necessarily defy the in-universe logic of the series, but they are undoubtedly weird.

It's certainly interesting as well being in a Star Wars universe without prequels or Old Republics, when the Emperor was just the Emperor and Darth Vader was a ""Dark Jedi."" At one point Luke suggests that perhaps the archives are incomplete. It all adds up to a story with a lot less nostalgia to pull from, and it sort of shows. Han starts put in the Cantina again. Someone has a bad feeling about something on two different occasions.

The new characters outshine the old, to a point. Han and Leia feel sort of weird, in the way Aang and Katara were rather a bit too lovey dovey in the Avatar sequel graphic novels. It's not the affection for one another, after all five years gave passed and she's having twins. It's that so much of the universe seems to have been on pause for 5 years, only for someone to suddenly press play again. Luke is understandably conflicted about training new Jedi in Leia and her children (and we know how that works out in both canons) but otherwise is the same guy we (well you probably more than me, reader) knew in VI.

I think Talon Kaarde is my favorite. He's cut from the same cloth as DJ from the ST but (from what I can tell thus far) with more of a moral center. He plays host to much of the second half of the book, which I enjoyed. Pallaeon is another interesting character, the first real Imperial audience pov. He keeps expecting his boss to be like Vader, but the situation couldn't be more different.

Speaking of his boss, the reason for the season is Vahn's most famous character Thrawn. He is of course, instantly compelling from the get go. He has depth you can key into from the first chapter. Though his cleverness and genius can be a bit frustrating. He works out the heroes' plans as soon as they make them like a blue Sherlock Holmes, sucking some of the drama out of middle part.

I'm not sure where I am with Mara Jade. She's a good character, but I remain sceptical of how they can smoothly transition her from ""Luke is my mortal enemy"" to ""Luke is my husband.""

My absolute favorite part is when Leia goes to Kashyyyk and the light accidental racism that ensues. I would love to see a sequence like this play out in one of the new movies, and to see a Wookiee village more like the one seen here than in Episode III. 

All in all I liked it, but owing to its reliance on the novel format it probably wouldn't make a better movie than VII. Much of the character work is internal monologue, and the aforementioned Kashyyyk scene is reliant on Wookiees with English subtitles, a sort of sacrilege in the films.

The subgroups and divides in Star Wars fandom is literally fascinating,"You've got fans that like all the eras but SW fandom is so much more than that.

You've got Original Trilogy fans; They may or may not adore Lucas.  But they love the Original Trilogy.  They feel the succeeding eras to the Original Trilogy just have never really ""got"" what made the original films what they were

You've got Retired Expanded Universe fans and within this group I'm sure there are EU loyalists who stick to the smaller and probably more intimate expanded universe material that came before the expanded universe got too big.  Think 90's EU material, the Zahn Trilogy, the Jedi Outcast series, things that kept SW alive to the fandom but existed during a time SW's mainstream appeal was sort of dormant before the Prequel explosion

You have Prequel Trilogy fans.  New fans to the prequels and old fans to the prequels.  Some loved these movies immediately upon their release.  Others were critics and slowly have found sincere love and appreciation for them.  For some of that group, seeing what SW is like without Lucas, opened their eyes to how much they miss him and how much they undervalued the prequel trilogy.  


Lucas Loyalists: They love and appreciate both of Lucas' trilogies; the Original Trilogy and Prequel Trilogy.  Their mileage on the old Expanded Universe varies from no interest to the material beyond the movies to a passionate love for the old Expanded Universe.  To them, Star Wars as it was ended when Lucas sold his rights to the IP.  The Disney era SW just simply isn't the same product or franchise in their eyes

Disney Loyalists: Disdain or disapproval for a lot of Lucas' work on the series and highly prefer the Sequel Trilogy and Sequel Trilogy tie-in material to previous SW eras.  Perhaps for some of this crowd, they had no interest in SW until the Disney/Sequel era introduced them to it


Obviously my definitions don't cover every group in the fandom and are far from perfect summaries for the groups I attempted to cover

There is no such thing as making a SW movies for SW fans.  The fanbase is very splintered and you can't please all off the different strokes of SW fandom.  

Can we step back and appreciate how intricate and fascinating SW fandom is?  Someone needs to make a documentary about this or some sort of video special.  If I knew the way to making such a thing, I would",StarWars,True,1523586289,2018-04-12

The Dumbest Reason People Hate TLJ,"I am not a Last Jedi super fan. I'm not trying to say it's good, even. Their are plenty of flaws in it, just like most other movies. And everyone gets to have their own opinions on it.

But there is this one complaint I keep hearing about the movie that is just kind of ridiculous.

This idea that Holdo Hyperspacing through Snoke's destroyer somehow undoes all of Star Wars battle logic. I have especially heard people say ""why didn't the rebels just hyperspace through the Death Star, wouldn't that just fixed everything for the rebellion, real quick and simple?""

It would have put a hole in one side that came out the other. 

They would have repaired it in like two weeks.

The whole point of RO and Episode IV is that there was *only one* way to blow up the death star.  ""if you can blow the reactor- the module- the whole system goes down""

Putting a tiny whole through it that would affect an extremely small amount of the volume/surface area and hoping it would hit that super tiny reactor module that they said was the size of - what was it - a bantha rat? -would be like finding a needle in a very very big haystack. Remember the death star is the size of a moon [ie a quarter the size of planet earth] and the rebellion ships are at max the size of a skyscraper.

And even if it did put a significant hole in the death star, it wouldn't prevent its functionality. Remember the death star II that was only a year or two more advanced could function when it was only half way built and almost entirely hollow?

Remember how Snoke's ship got a direct hit from Holdo's ship and the majority of the people on it *still* survived? Hyperspacing through it didn't Kill Supreme leader Kylo Ren or even prevent the Resistance from being almost wiped out to 20 people by the end of the movie. So if the Hyperspacing through something technique didn't even fully accomplish its goal against a glorified star destroyer, please don't try to argue it could have taken out THE Death Star. It's just silly.

I'm not even a fan of the death star. And I actually kind of hate Holdo. So I'm not saying this because I want to protect my favorite Star Wars or something, I'm saying it because it should be obvious. Hyperdriving into the death star would NOT have worked.

And besides 99% of the time a ship and its crew are more valuable when they, you know, aren't missile debris.",StarWars,True,1523587795,2018-04-12

First time I was able to sit and actually watch the movie in depth with no kids around. Loved the movie first and foremost. Of corse it has it flaws, but what tied the whole thing together for me was the ending, the ever binding idea of hope being the main driving force against the dark side and the empire/first order. Even better for me was my youngest woke up in her bed right as the ending was beginning with the showdown of Luke and Ben Solo, and as the broom kid used the force to grab the broom and looked up and saw the falcon go into light speed I was holding my eight month old and told her that hope was the best light against the dark and that force will be with her always, that right there that last scene pushed this movie over the edge.",StarWars,True,1523589057,2018-04-12

Prequels VS Sequels,"I’ve been rewatching the prequel and sequel movies and can’t help but notice how much they differ. 

While the prequels aren’t great examples of story telling, I still feel that they are more unique and in most ways feel more like Star Wars films than the sequels. The sequel films feel so stale and come across as pale imitations of the original trilogy. The prequels have more unique settings, alien creatures, droids, set pieces, etc. Attack of the Clones alone has more dynamic action sequences then the sequel trilogy. The prequels have different story structures which I enjoy because they come across as a natural progression in the story line of the entire saga. 
Sequels rely too much on fan service showing Xwings Tie fighters troopers callbacks that they don’t feel like their own trilogy. The prequel trilogy also does a great deal of world building and help expand the lore than the sequel trilogy has. As much as I enjoy the sequel trilogy I’ll probably skip them when I watch all the films in a marathon. ",StarWars,True,1523593252,2018-04-13
"Which movie feels the most ""Star Wars"" to you?","I know that the prequels get a ton of hate, but being a mid-20s human, they're the ones that I grew up with and have the most nostalgic attachment to. And I think because of this, Revenge of the Sith is the one that feels the most ""Star Wars"" to me. I was still a kid when I saw it for the first time, and I believe it was also the first Star Wars movie that I saw in theaters (if I saw Attack of the Clones in theaters, I was too young to remember it now). From the opening space battle to save Palpatine to the closing moments of Darth Vader being born, I was just captivated and my kid mind went wild. _This_ was Star Wars. And I've kept that opinion as I've grown.

Empire is my actual favorite film of the series, because as I aged I was able to come to really appreciate and understand what it was able to do as a sequel, but as far as filling me with that pure, Star Wars magic? None of them do it for me quite like Revenge of the Sith does.

Yes, its flawed. I have heard just about EVERY complaint, nit-pick, etc., all across the board, ranging from valid to ridiculous. That train's an exhausting one to be aboard. I don't really need to hear them again.

Instead, I'm curious to hear about what people LIKED (or loved) about it. For me, there's a lot. My personal favorites are Luke's arc, the continued theme of holding onto hope, the theme of rebuilding and learning from failure (how the past doesn't need to be killed, but not lived-in either; simply learned-from so one can move forward), and more specifically, the Yoda scene. Every line in that scene is perfect to me.

I wouldn't worry too much about IX having nobody to fight. There are a bunch of Jedi who didn't get killed at the academy, Hux, the whole first order, and Rey is more aggressive and corruptible than Luke ever was so she can't be ruled out as a potential dark side convert.",StarWars,True,1523602900,2018-04-13
Why I love the character of Han Solo,"Within his first appearance, Han Solo seems like a stone cold smuggler who cares about nobody but himself. His motivation is very selfish and self centered, he wants to save his own neck from Jabba's wrath for abandoning his shipment.

Han even made it clear from the start that he doesn't care about their little suicide mission. He shot Greedo in cold blood (original release), and didn't even care about the rebellion's larger plan to free everyone from the tyranny of the Empire.

However in the hanger on Yavin IV, Han asks Luke to join him. He notes how good Luke is in a firefight and sees a lot of potential in him. Luke refuses but tries to recruit him. After this fails, Han goes on his way to pay back the debt he owes Jabba.

In the end, it's revealed that Han has a heart of gold. He saves Luke and joins the cause to bring freedom to the galaxy.

Other than the fact that Han is a great character overall, he proves to be far more than just a mere side character. Intentional or not, Han is the one who set up one of the biggest redemption arcs in cinematic history.

Han mimics Vader's role in the whole trilogy. First, he's stone cold. Then he wants Luke to join him. And finally, he saves Luke and helps him destroy the tyranny of the Empire.

This is only taking into account Han's role in ANH. He was great ESB, okay in ROTJ, and great again in TFA. This is one of the biggest reasons I'm excited for his standalone movie, Solo.",StarWars,True,1523604618,2018-04-13

I'd Be Fine With Luke Staying Dead,Throughout the Sequel Trilogy the new characters have been overshadowed by the old faces and I think it'd be interesting to see how them hold their own story in IX.

Does Episode IX need a part one and a part two?,"Regardless of whether or not you enjoyed TLJ, I think we can all agree that it didn't exactly do much in terms of story progression or character development. This now places a heavy burden on Episode IX to conclude the story (whatever that is, after TLJ I honestly don't know) in a competent and satisfying way. Can JJ do this in just one movie? I don't think so.

I believe splitting Episode IX into two parts would be a good way to flesh out the world and the story before concluding the saga, and would stop the finish episode from feeling rushed. Also, more $$$ for Disney?",StarWars,True,1523612964,2018-04-13
My issues with TLJ,"I can't fit all of this in one post so  more is included in the comments. 

**Luke**

Luke giving up on Kylo goes against his main and most likeable character trait in the OT which is that he doesn't give up. Vader did far worse than Kylo for a lot longer yet Luke never gave up hope on Vader and he was right to do that. Now after he has proof anyone can be redeemed he just gives up on Kylo. Luke should if anything be even more likely to not give up on those close to him after vaders redemption as it proved his belief.

We also have the issue with how completely moronic Luke decisions to go into hiding was. Lukes reasoning is that because he can't take out Snoke, Kylo, the knights and Ren and the entire first order army at once he shouldn't bother, this is just a great example of the lazy excuses created to try and explain characters dumb decisions in TLJ. He couldn't defeat Vader, sidious, the inquisitors and the entire imperial army during the OT but that never made Luke even hesitate to help out in any way he could. Despite not being capable of that the rebellion would have likely failed had Luke not joined their cause. Hes the most powerful force user in the galaxy and we know he was more powerful than Snoke [because he turned Kylo as he believed only someone in the Skywalker bloodline could defeat Luke.](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/6221672-luke+accolade+2.jpg) This is particularly impressive given how arrogant Snoke is, despite that arrogance Snoke knew he couldn't beat Luke. Its been proven time and again in Star Wars how much the individual can help in major conflicts, thats one of the major themes in the franchise as a whole. This doesn't just apply to the incredibly powerful force users like Luke but regular force users and even non force sensitives like Han Solo, Padme, Tarkin and Thrawn, for better or worse they majorly helped their factions.  Luke knows these he's seen it many times and when he was far less powerful and experienced was one of the best examples so why does he suddenly think he cant make a difference ? In the clone wars Obi Wan, Anakin and Ahsoka were the difference between planets being won and lost many times as were many other jedi who were nothing compared to Luke in terms of power, people who'd be crushed like a bug by Vader in their primes unlike Luke who defeated him with a few years training. 

Luke abandons not just all his friends and those he cares about but the galaxy as a whole and leaves them to be inevitably killed or conquered by Snoke and the first order. Now some will say this isn't the fault of TLJ as TFA set up Luke being on the Island. Firstly [Luke was originally going to be using the force at the end of TFA when Rey meets him but the scene had to be altered as Luke cut himself from the force.](http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/star-wars/news/a847167/star-wars-mark-hamill-original-force-awakens-ending-luke-skywalker-the-force-last-jedi/) Secondly TFA never made any of the major issues people have with Luke decision thats why their was no outrage over Luke actual decision in TFA as people assumed he's have a damn good reason. All people knew was Luke had gone looking for the first jedi temple (Why look for that if Luke just wanted to die ?), that Luke left after Kylo fell to the dark side and that nobody had been able to contact him since he left. All of these could have easily been given good explanations that actually fit with Lukes character. Luke could have gone to the first Jedi temple to find a way to try and help redeem Kylo or to try and stop others falling to the dark side. He could have gone to find a long lost force ability to try and help defeat snoke. Given Snoke is from the unknown regions of the galaxy and not a sith he could have some unique abilities (such as force drain which hasn't been used in canon) that his training from Yoda and Obi Wan haven't taught him how to deal with. He could have gone their to train his remaining padawans so some day together they could defeat Snoke, Kylo and the knights of ren. He could be ignoring Leias trying to call out to him with the force as he doesn't want to risk Snoke sensing where he is, as i said Snoke isnt a sith and is from the unknown regions and he connected with Rey despite never meeting her. He could have done the same thing but instead of connecting through Kylo he connects through Leia to find Luke (If Luke replied to her calls) Luke and Leia actually have a bond and it makes sense they do unlike Kylo and Rey who just had a breif fight once. Obi Wan and Maul never had such a bond, neither did Anakin and Dooku and both duos fought many times and hated each other far more. 

Luke mentally breaking once Kylo turned and leaving him to commit atrocities so evil Luke considering killing him in his sleep for a moment makes Luke one of the worst Jedi in canon and most of those he's better than are the few who turned to the dark side like Pong Krell or Barris Offe. Lets have a look at a few examples of what good Jedi do in similar situations. When Jedi Master and Council member Kit Fisto fights General Grievous only minutes after having seen him kill his padawan [he saddened by his death but stays calm when they face off and does his best to try and capture or kill Grievous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-t9GlT9qmk). When Maul Obi Wans greatest enemy kills Satine a woman Obi Wan loved when he was younger right in front of him [Obi Wan is saddened but never comes close to anger or hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lGETyUkjdo). When Kanan (who at this point only had a padawans training and wasnt even a knight yet) belived the Grand Inquisitor had killed his padawan Ezra he didn't let his fear consume him, [he let it go and used his new calmness to defeat a foe he'd always lost to in the past as he was weakened by his fear.](https://youtu.be/mk7y2O5bf2Y?t=86) By far the best example though is Luke, when his Aunt and Uncle who were basically his parents were brutally killed by the Empire he never thought about hiding or wanting to get revenge on the Empire...he didn't even show any anger her hate. [All Luke wanted to do was become a Jedi, a guardian and peace and justice ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P4Q50PiGCo) to try and stop similar things happening to anyone else. This was with no jedi training this was just who Luke was as a person at his very core. By the end of ROTJ Luke had a become a Jedi and a great one yet he completely breaks because of an incident that is obviously horribly but certainly not much more than what he's been through before and become stronger for like in the Emperors throne room. Nobody wanted Luke to be some flawless character in the ot, but if you are going to give him struggles and have him learn lessons make them things he hasn't already learnt and gone threw. He believes Kylo cannot be redeemed and there no good in him, though we don't know if he'll be redeemed we know their is good in him. Why can Luke of all people not sense that, Luke should have remembers Yodas lesson 

Luke:I don't believe it!

Yoda:That is why you fail.

Another example of Lukes stupidity in TLJ is he thinks the Jedi need to end because they allowed Sidious to rise up and take over the galaxy at the height of their power. But the fault of Sidious rise to power should be blamed on the republic which gave him all the power willingly and believed all his lies. What did the Jedi actually do wrong during the prequels with regards to sidious rise to power ?

1) He was voted chancellor fairly.

2) His term as chancellor was extended through a vote as where the increase in his powers as chancellor such as getting an executive decision to allow the clone army to be used to defend against the Separatist.

3) Assuming Palpatine wasn't a sith the republic wouldn't have won the war without the clone army and the clones wouldn't have won without the jedi, both were vital. If the republic lost the galaxy would have been ruled by Dooku and Grievous (bare in mind they didn't know Palpatine was a sith during the war) .

4) They had no leads or evidence that Palpatine was Sidious and only acted against him then. Even that was arguably not enough evidence but clearly the right choice wasn't to wait and do nothing.

Should the jedi have just left the republic to be taken over by the separatists? Should they have overruled democracy and kicked Palpatine out of power because they didn't personally like Palpatine even though they had no evidence ? of cause not. It was the corrupt and ignorant republic which was to blame for sidious rise. With Palpatine the Jedi acted the best they could with the information they had.

The Jedi kept peace for 1000 years, Luke failed to do so for 30 ironically 26 of those years he was a Jedi following the Jedi way. We also have the point that the empire likely would have still been in power if it wasn't for the jedi helping Luke, yes Luke rejected Obi Wan and Yodas belief that he needed to kill Vader but that was his only issue with their code. 

Luke death in particular was awful. I'll explain in the next paragraph but first I have to make something clear. Luke didn't die of exhaustion he let himself pass on into the living force like Yoda and Obi wan which is why his body disappeared. Had he died from the injuries which come from exhaustion his body would have stayed their after his death like with Qui Gon and Anakin.

So Luke let himself die when the galaxy needed him most, billions will die and suffer and even more if the first order were to win, we know they'll be defeated because Disney wouldn't have the trilogy end any other way but Luke doesn't. He essentially doomed the galaxy again not only negating the good he did in the OT but solidifying his place as one of the worst jedi In canon.

How do you feel about KOTOR taking place so far in the past? I feel like it cheapens the prequel and sequel eras by making it seem like not much technological advancement has taken place in the 5000 years between.,"Just seems like the Galaxy is forever in this loop with technology hardly advancing, and the dark and light side constantly in battle. 

I know they aren’t canon currently, but I’ve been trying to get into KOTOR again (loved it as a kid), but it’s placement in the timeline makes me have a negative outlook on it. Why has so much time taken place with so little technological advancement?

Ben Solo and Anakin Skywalker,"Inspired by that earlier tumblr post.
I don't know much about Force Canon, someone tell me if this sounds okay.
Ben Solo, while conflicted and dark, cannot see force ghosts, the dark side in him is too inward. They are blocked from his vision, while only someone with more light can actually see their masters of the past.
As such, when he prays to his grandfather about a call to the light he feels guilty over, maybe that call is literally Anakin trying to tug him back.
What if in episode 9, he becomes conflicted enough to finally see the vision of his grandfather he always wanted. Whereupon, Anakin bitch slaps him and Kylo either turns or renounces the legacy of Vader entirely, catering to your redemption/villain needs.",StarWars,True,1523617328,2018-04-13

I've always wondered about one thing...(Darth title),"Darth Vader was (I assume) pretty well known in the galaxy as he fought in many battles for the Empire. He is also known as a henchman for the Emperor and many people, at least internally in the military knew his name.

How come then his ""Darth"" title doesn't raise any red flags? Surely it has to be known as a Sith title which would remind people of the  Jedi-Sith wars in the Old Republic which in turn would lead people to the conclusion that Palps is also a Sith? Weren't the Sith the ""evil"" ones back then? Or how were they seen?

"Rey's character progression from believing her parents will come back, to believing her parents are important.","One of the interesting points brought up by people to show the disconnect between TFA and TLJ is that in TFA Rey is very focused on the fact that her parents will be coming back for her. It then seems out of nowhere in the next movie when she is focused instead on who her parents are. 

I think though this shift in perspective is evidence of the growth Rey is going through between both movies. In the first one, she is childishly focused on the belief that of course her parents will be coming back for her. She's always been in denial on Jakku and has convinced herself they love her and wouldn't just abandon her. 


In TFA she has to accept that her parents aren't coming back, but that denial just transforms and becomes focused on the idea that there must have been a REASON her parents won't come back. 

It's akin to a child suffering from divorce who brags that his father is a big time lawyer who just doesn't have the time to hang out.  Obviously his father still love him, he's just busy. Rey has created a narrative for herself in the same way, where if her parents aren't coming back, they must be very important and there must be a reason why she was abandoned.

Overall at her core Rey just wants desperately to be loved, and the idea that her parents cared so little for her that they would sell her, would be utterly destructive to how she sees the world. Rey needs to believe they are important because after TFA it's the only thing that would make sense in the story she tells herself.",StarWars,True,1523631755,2018-04-13

is Rey going dark side?,"I know at the end of TLJ it's pretty obvious which ""side"" she chooses, but I can't help shake the idea that she went to the dark on ach-to and didn't even stop herself. (according to Luke). It made him so fearful he had to walk away and shame Rey for doing it. They have planted the seeds in the audience mind about how easily it was for her to go to the dark. 

I could be over-thinking things, but the only way I could see Kylo being redeemed is that he falls in love with Rey, sees Rey flirting with the dark side, and doesn't want her to go that way, so he sacrifices himself to save Rey from turning herself. 

Rey puts so much emphasis on turning Ben Solo back to the light, when it's ""her"" she needs to really be worried about.

Who is more powerful: Yoda or Sidious,"For this argument, I’m going to be referring to the movies as well as the clone wars series.

Now these two characters are in almost every aspect equals, however I’ve always wondered why people say Palpatine bested Yoda in episode III, when in reality, it was a tie. Yes, Yoda did run away, however, Palpatine tried to do so after one force push from Yoda. Yoda didn’t run away because he believed he was going to lose, he just didn’t believe the risk of the Jedi dying was worth him fulfilling his personal vendetta against the emperor. The other thing; Yoda did win that final force battle, where he went flying off the edge. Sidious was looking like we was about done, and Yoda was holding strong. Sidious has the height advantage, and when Yoda jumped onto the platform, he was standing closer to the edge. As a result he went off, while Palpatine was able to hold on. 

Now in the Clone War Series, Palpatine makes a projection in which Dooku fights Anakin and Palpatine takes on Yoda, with it ending with Yoda and Anakin winning (Palpatine also falls off a platform similar to Yoda while they’re in a force lock). 

Palpatine and Yoda head to head:

Dueling: Yoda is the obvious winner. He’s so fast and agile, nobody can keep up with him. Even though Sidious mastered all forms of lightsaber fighting, Yoda can smash anybody (besides Luke in episode 7) in a lightsaber battle.

Brute strength: Palpatine takes it. Palpatine can lash out with the force and do more damage than Yoda in one lightning bolt.

Control: Yoda is the clear winner. Every time Yoda takes a second to coordinate his attacks, Palpatine has to retreat. An example of this is when he threw the pad at Palpatine in episode III, forcing him to jump down. 

Overall force ability: Completely equal. They’re opposites of each other, and the most powerful brings up until Luke reached his prime.


Conclusion: I would say Yoda and Palpatine are equal, and either of them can win a fight against the other depending on the day and environment. 

Flat out duel: Yoda smashes if there isn’t anything for Palpatine to use, and it’s just a lightsaber fight with some force abilities.

Closed in area: Yoda, he can easily outmaneuver Yoda.

Large area: Palpatine, he can get put distance between them and force lightning Yoda or throw heavy stuff on him.

LucasArts Reformed?,"Ever since EA was given the exclusive rights to develop and publish Star Wars video games we've gotten two major releases in the span of 5 years.

The first Battlefront game was fine, but lackluster given how short it was on content. The second Battlefront was a much better game, but ruined by its pay-to-win progression which was fixed far too late for it to matter.

When EA's license to make Star Wars games expires, I think it would be nice to see LucasArts reorganized and brought back to act as a developer and publisher similar to Bethesda in a way.

If that were to happen then numerous developers would have the opportunity to create different types of Star Wars games! We as fans wouldn't have to just sit around waiting years for EA to release a new game that could very well be disappointing.

This is just a thought I always have when I think back at how many Star Wars games we used to have compared to what we have now. It's wishful thinking on my part, but I felt like sharing.",StarWars,True,1523643646,2018-04-13

Now Kylo. The less said the better. He's whiny, but not likably so like Luke or C-3PO. He's a little bitch. He looks like an early-rejected cut of Vader. The whole movie is an early-rejected cut of ANH, but Kylo stands out the most in that.

Can someone explain TLJ opening sequence?,"I’ve watched the movie 10 times now, the opening sequence where the Dreadnaught shows up and literally 7 seconds later Poe is there as if he they knew it was gonna show up.

When all of the transports are safe Leia tells Poe to disengage and he disobeys and the bombers come anyways and the bombers all get blown up.

They were waiting there with a plan to counter something they had no idea was going to happen. On top of that, why are the bombers making a run when they take orders from Leia. 

I’m not trying to nit pick what is a neat scene, but the entire sequence makes absolutely no sense what so ever. It’s always bothered me and I finally sat down and followed the dialog scene by scene. For the life of me why would the bombers bomb the Dreadnaught if Leia wanted to disengage and leave. 

On top of that Poe is responsible for blowing up Star Killer Base and now this deadnaught but then chastised, reprimanded and and treated like traitor for reasons that make absolutely no sense considering we saw Leia smile when the Dreadnaught blew up.

Ben Solo theory,"I been thinking about Ben Solo lately and particularly the usage of the mask vs the unmasked in TFA and TLJ. If you go really far and think about J. Lacans theory about identification and mirror theory and kind of put it in Bens perspective it all kind of makes sense to me why he eventually created his alter ego, Kylo Ren. 

Lacan talks about two stages in the identification process, the primary and the secondary. The primary is the one where a child looks at itself in a mirror and creates a ego. The secondary part is when you start to compare yourself with others and may see your flaws, and perhaps see yourself as something your not. If you put Ben Solo in this theory, could it be that when he saw himself in the mirror, he actually saw his grandfather and the identification process was in that way cancelled which in the long way created Kylo Ren? 

And it is here the mask has its function and representation. The mask itself already stands for all the evil within Darth Vader, and it also stands for Ben’s ideal picture of what he has to become, and might never will(who knows). I think it’s interesting how they use it as object and turn it into a representation about Ben’s conflict within himself. 

I somehow though that with the mask, it is Kylo Ren who acts and speaks, and without it it’s only a conflicted boy that happens to be misguided by himself in the early stages of the identification part. This is only something I thought about and even might write a dissertation about later since I defiantly think it’s worth studying the mask part in The Ben Solo/Kylo Ren saga.",StarWars,True,1523654469,2018-04-13

"Why Rey is NOT a Mary Sue, and why that whole argument is ridiculous to begin with.","This complaint has honestly bothered me since TFA came out, but I'm amazed at how many people still write Rey off as a ""Mary Sue"" all the time.

A Mary Sue is supposed to be a self-inserted female character that is inexplicably the best at every single thing, and has no flaws, etc.. 

Let's look at some of the major complaints about Rey.

**1. She's too good at piloting! How did she learn to fly?!!**

Well, actually, she's not an amazing pilot. Rey is the ONLY character to ever crash into an onscreen object (the ground... the bridge thing...etc) without intention. She flew in atmosphere and managed to eventually rid of 2 tie fighters with Finn's help. That's about it. 

Where did she learn to fly? There are books that talk about how she used a flight simulator, etc and would learn about numerous ships. She would practice flying them and also about their parts and how they worked, which knowledge would be put to work when she was scavenging. 

""BUT I SHOULDNT HAVE TO READ THE BOOK TO KNOW""

Fair enough. In the film, we are told that Rey is a pilot. She tells Finn she can fly, but has never left the planet (which we know from the film is by choice). 
Let's compare this to many, many people's favorite character - Luke Skywalker. We never once see Luke fly in ANH prior to him going up against the Death Star. We are told that Luke can fly and that he ""bullseyed womprats back home!"". 

So, basically Luke flew casually prior. Which, even if we take ""I can fly"" as an excuse for being able to fly, still doesn't make it believable that he could go up against the Death Star. An armed military station with turrets and tie fighters with trained soldiers, etc... That's like having a pilots license from your local airport and thinking you're ready to fly an F16 into a warzone. 

So in terms of flight, both of them just tell us they can fly and then do it (same with Anakin, whose piloting feats are also more impressive than Reys). 

Between outrunning two tie fighters with the help of a gunner, and flying in armed combat against a battle station dodging turrets and killing tie fighters and then blowing the whole station up, etc - which is more impressive? 

Her piloting abilities are NOTHING special. Not to mention that everyone in Star Wars can fly, it's basically like driving. How come no one is constantly complaining about Obi-Wan's ability to suddenly be a pilot in Ep2-3? It's amazing that no one has a problem with any other character except for Rey being able to fly. Not to mention she's a scavenger, so obviously she would know about parts of ships and what would sell, etc... so she'd have to learn about mechanics. But again, this isn't something that ever bothers anyone with any other character. 

**2. She's too good with a lightsaber, she beat Kylo Ren wtf!!!!**

We see Rey use her staff earlier in the movie, and we know she was on Jakku for around 10 years probably. We can reason that she probably knows how to use her staff and has used it to defend herself at least once prior to TFA. So, she knows how to fight with a melee weapon. ""STAVES ARE DIFFERENT THAN LIGHTSABERS"". Right, but she still understands melee combat and has been in combat before. Using the lightsaber, she's running away most of the fight initially. Watch TFA again if you don't believe me. She is losing and running away until she ""let's the force in"" which is very similar to the moment Luke had in ANH with the death star. 

But let's also look at her opponent. Kylo Ren had just killed his father, was shot in the gut by a bowcaster (which was built up to blow shit apart the entire movie), was hit by Finn and probably a bit tired from that... not to mention being shot in the gut, was ordered to bring Rey to Snoke rather than kill her, but he also has probably never been in an actual lightsaber duel prior to that. 
So basically, Rey fought a very weakened Kylo Ren and was still losing most of the fight.

**3. Rey can use the force too quickly!**

The only force powers we see Rey actually use (in two films) are pulling the saber, a mind trick on a Stormtrooper (on her third attempt), and lifting rocks. 

None of these are things we haven't seen before - and the saber pull and mind trick as far as we know from the films are relatively simple (especially on weakminded people like stormtroopers). They are thrown around casually with little to no effort. Lifting rocks (boulders, x wing, etc doesnt matter) is all the same principle. 

Regardless of the powers used, we see other characters have access to the force for the first time without training in similar ways. Luke does miraculous things in ESB prior to his brief training with Yoda, etc. 

""But Luke struggled to pull the saber! He couldn't lift the X-Wing either!""

What does Luke tell Yoda? Does he say, ""Well shit man, you better train for 7 months and get your midichlorian power level up to 9000 before you're ready for that!"" No. 

He tells Luke he fails because he doesn't believe it. He tells Luke that lifting pebbles and lifting the X Wing are no different. Luke does not believe in any of this stuff from the get go. And he shouldn't. He didn't know anything about the Jedi, etc, he's pretty skeptical of the whole thing even when he gets to Dagobah. 

Meanwhile, Rey grew up believing in the legend of Luke Skywalker and all the stories of him and all that jazz. So she BELIEVES that this stuff is possible. She's confident that she can do it, and she believes in it. You may not like the explanation, but if you want to take the OT at heart - that's what it is. 

In the ST, she has the bridged mind thing with Kylo, which as we know opened some doors for her as well. She sees some shit in his head, so we can assume she gets an idea that this stuff is for real and maybe she even gets a glimpse of how to do a bit, who knows. But frankly, her accomplishments in the force are not that impressive. It's not like she's pulling ships out of the sky or doing Starkiller or Revan type things. She is doing things we've seen numerous characters do without 20 minutes of explanation about how they were just able to do something. 

**4. She doesn't have any flaws!** 

Maybe we are all watching different movies. I'd argue that Rey is far more of a flawed character than Luke is in the OT.

Here's a few:

- Trusts everyone blindly. Didn't see that Finn was lying, believes Kylo would turn and be good which caused a huge fuckup and basically gave Kylo the opportunity to kill Snoke and become Supreme Leader. Trusts that Luke is going to be this amazing dude and teach her everything, and refuses to understand Luke's warnings or point of view.

- Rey is overconfident. As I just mentioned, her overconfidence is part of the reason the whole thing with Snoke/Kylo happens. She fucks that whole deal up. In TFA, she pulls the lever that unleashes the Rathtars, fucks that up.

- Emotionally messed up. Denial. We know that Rey has the ability to leave Jakku, but she never does. She wore her hair the same way in hopes that her parents would recognize her when they came back for her, etc.. She basically creates this entire world in her head where she thinks they will come back, and stays in the same place trying to be the same person for them to come back to. Even after leaving the planet, she wants to go back to Jakku. She then screws everything up on Takodana when she has a breakdown and runs into the forest which leads to her capture. Speaking of denial, we learn it's more screwed up in TLJ when she basically knows the entire time what is up and has convinced herself it's something else. She's a mental case. She cries probably more than anyone else has in Star Wars and has these emotional meltdowns. She gets super angry when someone doesn't agree with her (Luke/Kylo) and doesn't know how to deal with it without lashing out. 

A few other things. Rey is the only person that misses a blaster shot in TFA. She is getting her ass handed to her by one of the Praetorian guards while Kylo is 3v1ing them. Again, she's the only person we see on screen crashing into stuff on accident in the movies. 


So, I really don't see how Rey is a ""Mary Sue"" at all. In fact, she's not the most competent character in the series by a long shot. 

Frankly, if you want to be okay with Anakin and Luke being amazing at everything because ""they're the chosen one and the chosen one's son!"" (which is a cop out trope itself), I don't see why people have an issue with Rey being part of the will of the force as well. Even when there are explanations for a lot of her abilities and actions.

...................

Let's look at some of the things I never see people complain about with Luke, for example, that I guarantee people would complain about if it were Rey.

Luke tells us he can fly, and then the first time we ever see him flying is against the Death Star which is armed with Tie Fighters and turrets, etc. He somehow manages to be one of the last alive, blows up some other ties, dodges tons of fire, and obviously blows up the death star. But right, Rey surviving one tie fighter is crazy.

Luke uses a grappling hook from a Stormtrooper belt to cross a chasm while holding onto Leia. Okay so, he has never used a grappling hook before as far as we know, and it wasn't even from his belt, so we can't assume that he had it prior to that. Yet he manages to throw it around this 2"" pipe looking thing pretty high up and then swing across a chasm while holding another person on the first try, while being shot at.... soooooo, what's the excuse for that? If Rey did it, there would be an uproar. 

Luke uses a blaster rifle and kills numerous Stormtroopers. Again, Luke has had no military training and got beat up by a Tusken previously. Yet somehow he's able to kill a ton of stormtroopers who are also shooting at him, because I guess he suddenly knows how to use a blaster rifle. 

Luke cuts into the bottom of an AT-AT after zipping up to it's belly and then he throws a grenade in it, falls like 40 ft, is perfectly fine. Oh, and also the AT-AT just blows up entirely. How did Luke know that would kill it? When are we told he knew how to do that or how he knew where to attack? How come he didn't even get hurt from the fall? etc.

I could go on about Luke and Anakin, and other characters as well - but the point is, all the ""Mary Sue"" complaints about Rey are silly when A. her feats are not that amazing, and B. every other character is excused when they do the same or more impressive things without explanation. And before anyone goes ""okay so wow no complaints of Rey are valid apparently!"" I think people are free to dislike the character if they want. However, that doesn't make her a Mary Sue. You can dislike that she can fly, but that doesn't mean there is no reason she is able to do so. 

The bottom line, no matter what, is it's a space fantasy. This is not sci-fi, it's not a reality grounded action movie, it's a fantasy. All the characters do things that none of us could ever do, and they all do amazing things that are improbable or are not explained with an hour of explanations or backstory.
Could parts of Rey be fleshed out a bit more? Sure. Same could be said for tons of characters, including Luke and Anakin in their first 3 films. But I don't think she is a Mary Sue at all. And you certainly have to wonder why those who complain about her being a Mary Sue have no problem with any of the other characters doing anything.

**TL;DR: Rey isn't a Mary Sue. People blow everything she does out of proportion and then excuse the feats of every other character.** ",StarWars,True,1523658786,2018-04-13

Trilogy on VHS,"Watching Star Wars on VHS as I write this. I found the trilogy at a thrift store, but in a cool box set I have never seen before. The three films have the original artwork on the boxes, and the case has some cool artwork too, with two panels that flip out on the side. 

I thought for a moment that I had found a better version of the films without all that ugly CGI crap in them. But, I notice at the beginning that it still listed the film as a New Hope. Didn't the original unaltered version just say Star Wars?

Should Kylo Ren become Star Wars' Vegeta?,"While I agree a redemption arc would be a little overplayed, I can't help but think this would be kind of a cool direction to take Episode IX. Imagine it explaining that in the time skip between films, Kylo's grip on the First Order has been weakening, as Hux and other officers have been trying to seize power. They stage a coup and try to kill Kylo, but he barely escapes.

With his dream of conquering the galaxy basically dead, Kylo offers to help Rey and the Resistance in a dire moment (First Order about to engage in a last-stand battle with them) and Rey reluctantly accepts, having no other option.

It wouldn't really be a redemption, as Kylo would still be consumed with hatred and using the dark side, but we would see him fight alongside the good guys, maybe using more brutal tactics than we see the good guys usually use - effectively becoming the Star Wars series' Vegeta. The bad guy fighting on the good side, but who never quite turns good himself.

I could see the Knights of Ren as either antagonists that Kylo agrees to help take out, or allies he could bring with him to sweeten the pot in Rey accepting their help.

Who is the first author you would like to see write a story about the original trilogy cast interacting with a young Ben solo?,"Technically we could say wendig was the first but Ben was a infant in that series.

And while Ben will be in the last shot book in a couple days he is only a year or two old.

So do you have a writer who you want to get first dibs at writing a book involving Ben and the Solo Skywalker Clan. And whose work could really set the tone for how future books treat the solo Skywalker Clans family interactions?

I think a lot of people's First Choice would be Zhan but in the song Trilogy and duology he sort of found ways to write the kids out of the story. However he did say he wanted to write a family story about Luke and Mara and being at one point so maybe having him do one for the new solo Clan would be good. Personally I think he's better for big epic stories than the smaller more character focused ones.

Claudia gray would probably be another Quick Pick due to Lost Stars being such a good character-driven story. She would also be one of my first pigs just due to how well she captured Leia in the princess of Alderaan books and allowed bail and Leia to have a good argument about joining the Rebellion without making either one of them look like the bad guy.

Well Luciano would be another quick pick for people I feel that his riding would be better for later on in the timeline when we're dealing more with snoke's influence and the stuff ben is going through before the fall of the academy.

And then there is already always the chance of a animated series. And I think filoni has the best grasp of what makes Star Wars Star Wars and is able to do a lot of things that will please both the new Canon and legends audiences and start to heal some of the Rifts like problems people have with the family feeling too distant and cold with each other.

Also I want windig as far away from the solo family and Star Wars in general as he can possibly be.

What exactly is it that Qui-Gon sends to Obi-Wan? If the device Qui-Gon is using can collect data that includes Anakin's midi-chlorian count, then surely it can display that data, right? So why does Qui-Gon need to send the data to Obi-Wan instead of reading it himself? That would be like sending the results of a breathalyzer test back to police HQ in order to get someone's blood alcohol level.

Snoke didn't bridge Rey and Ben's minds.," Remember that portion of Rey's vision that had everyone confused? Kylo is with the KOR and you see him stab somebody. There are bodies everywhere. Then Kylo realizes Rey is there and lunges towards her. A lot of us thought that might have been the destruction of Luke's academy, but Kylo and the Knights wouldn't have gotten his dark side gear on before killing the other students. So when was this? Here are the facts:

Kylo isn't reacting to someone else, the scene appears otherwise empty, except for Rey.

Kylo is wearing his TFA uniform and helmet, so this likely doesn't take place in the future as the helmet is destroyed and we rarely see the sane outfit used two movies apart. 

Unlike the other scenes,  Kylo reacts to Rey even though she is an observer. This isn't a future scene between them, and if it was a past, it means she would have previously met Kylo, unlike the movie makes explicitly clear is not the case. 

Before every scene where their minds connect,  there is a whirring sound effect used.  You can hear it right before Kylo looks up at Rey. 

I believe because of these components of this 1/4 portion of the vision, that this is Rey and Kylo Ren's first ""Force Skype."" The Force triggers the vision,  and it creates the bond between them. Snoke didn't do it as he claimed. ",StarWars,True,1523686095,2018-04-14

A New pair of eyes on TLJ,"I finally watched TLJ with my son last night (he's 5, and it would have been unfair on everyone at the cinema to take him to such a long film) after the blu-ray release in the UK this week and it's really opened my eyes to some of my own objections with the film.

I consider myself a huge Star Wars universe fan, played all the games, own many of the books and comics, going to be getting matching ""I love you/I know"" tatoos with the wife this summer - confession, i've always thought the films were mostly shit. I saw each of the PT once, FA once, RO twice and TLJ once. Typically, we only ever go to see a film once at the cinema, even if we loved it. Going to see RO twice was an anomaly.

I'm nearly 30, so the OT were already old by the time I was watching them in the mid nineties, the PT was ""my"" Star Wars, and outside of a few Clone trooper set pieces, Maul and Vaders rising, I hated them. I hated Luke, Leia and Han were pretty cool, most of the OT just looked old and Vader hardly ever *did* anything to deserve the bad ass rep my big brother held him in.

Watched Force Awakens and thought it looked good but was pretty shallow, Rogue One I thoroughly enjoyed and is probably my favourite of all the films so far, and then TLJ came.

Awesome visuals, a Luke I didn't care about interacting with a Rey who I consider boring, a nice little nod to Yoda, Chewie doing nothing, I quite like Canto Bight, DJ and the Finn storyline (though it's ludicrously placed in the movie), Snoke goes nowhere and Kylo, the only real redeeming feature in the ST in my opinion.

How my sons eyes lit up to everything I rolled my eyes at, how my son gasped when Snoke was killed (""He used the force on the lightsaber dad!"") and jumped off the sofa to help Rey and Kylo fight the guards, he awwed at the baby Porgs, he laughed aloud when the Porg splats onto the screen during the Crait flight, he nearly pissed himself when Luke milked the space walrus (""Lukes drinking boob milk daddy!""). The gasp and the look of awe when Leia floated back to the ship, he was twitching with excitement. The bits i particularly enjoyed, the word plays between Luke and Rey, the exposition between Rey and Kylo, the flashback scenes to the New Jedi temple - he was bored to tears with.

All the childish things we circlejirked over, all the plot holes, badly written or nonsensical plot points were lost in his childish delight.

I'm still on the fence with TLJ, so many parts i disliked or was bored with, coupled with a few amazing scenes that stand out as some of my favourites ever (light speed fleet jump, throne room fight, every scene with Kylo), and yet my son has already chosen it to watch as his Saturday night treat.

Kylo remains his favourite character, closely followed by Vader, and I hope JJ does him justice in episode IX.",StarWars,True,1523690793,2018-04-14

"The Last Jedi, R2-D2 and Episode IX (spoilers)","So last night I rewatched The Last Jedi for the first time since seeing it at the cinema and I have to say I’m ok with the Luke Skywalker arch, I do still think he’ll be back in some form for Episode IX.

What I’m not ok with is the treatment of R2-D2, that guy has seen some sh*t in his time and I think he deserves more screen time. He’s basically been reduced to a cameo appearance in the first two sequel movies! Him and C3PO are literally the MAIN Star Wars characters, there right from Episode I and still going strong. In my mind C3PO was always R2-D2’s sidekick and the new films are hugely lacking the dynamic they had together. With The Force Awakens ‘being Han Solo’s movie’, The Last Jedi being ‘Luke Skywalker’s movie’ and with Carrie Fisher not with us anymore (RIP) I think it’s fitting that Episode IX (The Robot Jedi) should be ‘R2-D2’s movie (with a dash of C3PO)’. 

R2-D2 has been the driving force behind the entire saga and it’s only fitting that now the Resistance is on its last legs it is R2-D2’s turn to become the galaxies saviour, forget Rey and her superpowers there’s only one true Jedi left and he’s a robot!

Which stories from the Clone War era are your favorites?

I'm not going to lie, I'm not just asking.

See, I'm planning to write some 'Star Wars' fan fiction wherein I not only attempt to improve upon the Prequel Trilogy, but expand the films to 5 episodes instead of 3.

So far, I moved 'Attack of the Clones' to Episode 1, and 'Revenge of the Sith' will be Episode 5 in this head canon.

In my opinion, some of the Clone War tales' titles sound either too vague or too specific for a title, so I came up with a couple of my own: 'Clash of Clones' and 'Droids of Discord.' Also, 'Labyrinth of Evil' sounds like a great 'Star Wars' kind of title, so I want to use that as well.

This generalisation that filler=bad just boggles my mind. ",StarWars,True,1523721459,2018-04-14
[SPOILER TLJ]Who completed their training?,"Not sure if this was ever discussed, but it's something that came to mind.

Did Ben Solo complete his training? During that whole scene with Rey down, Snoke continued to say he could see in Ben's mind and intentions. And Solo would kill his true enemy. As well as saying, this would complete his training as heir apparent to Darth Vader.

But this is similar to Darth Sidious description on killing his master. Was this planned and intentional by Snoke? To set it up for Solo to complete his training by actually turning on his master, and killing him?",StarWars,True,1523721698,2018-04-14

There is something I don't quite understand about the prophecy of the Chosen One.,"I recently watched Star Wars The Last Jedi and I think someone's comment stated that the prophecy fulfilled with both Anakin and Luke. However if the prophecy is about bringing balance to The Force then:

Anakin becoming Darth Vader, executing Order 66 eliminating almost all the Jedi on the universe leaving two Jedi alive (Yoda and Obi-wan) and two Sith (Sidious and Vader). So far then, Sith and Jedi are equal on number. But acording to the Rule of 2 that Darth Bane made, it was so the Sith would win over the Jedi and that is not balance because the Dark side is choking (no pun intended) the Light side.

On the Last Jedi, there is ''balance'' or so to speak because I don't think the political affairs between the First Order and the Rebellion really matter to the Force. Now, Kylo kills Bad guy Snoke, right? apprentice over master (I don't know if this is cannon or not) but he doesn't get yellow Sith eyes and now there is just one ''sith'' and one jedi that is Rey, given the fact that Luke dies.

I though Rey was not fully a Jedi, at least not in the way The Jedi Order demanded it but let me guess that is not necessary since Luke earned his tittle of Jedi Master even though if there was no council or something of the like. The plot of the Force on the new movies is to bring down old costumes we had on the prequels, no more Jedi and no more Sith.

This is what I don't understand then, is The Chosen One suppossed to bring balance to The Force by having the Light side and the Dark side even or to destroy both Jedi and Sith? (which the new movies seem to go for the later one).",StarWars,True,1523727586,2018-04-14

Proof Palpatine Concealed his True Appearance During Clone Wars,"In the book aftermath life debt , the epilogue takes place 30 years before the current timeline.  
Gallius Rax is a stow away on the imperialus when palpatine finds him and gives rax the opportunity to help him with the observatory. 

In this chapter, the face of palpatine is described as being “pale as a moon and just as craggy, with lines drawn in the skin like clay from a bent knife blade”

Is Snoke in the film a Projection?,"I’m reasonably sure this has been put forward before, but on watching TLJ I can’t shake the feeling that this is indeed the case. Lots of strange little quirks seem to pointing to it. After watching the section on Crait, I’m beginning to think Luke’s Projection was dropping clues for the audience the entire time.

- when I first saw TLJ, I remember the glow at snoke’s waist around the saber looking a little odd - quite bright, and unlike any lightsaber burn I’d seen. I always assumed this was incidental... until I realised the only place I’d seen it elsewhere was on Luke’s Projection.

- Luke’s Projection appears to do specifically everything we see Snoke do, but no more... snoke touches people, interacts, speaks, and his corpse remains just like the dice. However, he never strikes anyone, uses a saber directly, or manipulates anything. He leaves no trace of his presence.

- the force lightning effect, where he bounces it off the ground, always confused me. Why did he do that? No idea, but if he’s a Projection, it would be a perfect disguise for the fact the lightning comes from the deck.

- we see a perfect demo early on that Snoke does not need to be physically present to TK anyone.

- snoke’s methods would certainly support the idea of having a Projection even in his throne room.

- he doesn’t appear to die immediately after stabbing despite the wound being catastrophic.

What do you guys think? I’ve been looking for anything that would definitively prove he isn’t a Projection (at the very least, doing something that would violate what we know a Projection can do) but I can’t see it.",StarWars,True,1523729618,2018-04-14
Costume questions Sequals,"First big question is why did general Leia go from wearing a resistance uniform in the force awakens to a very elegant dress in the last Jedi?  Especially since it was either the same day or day later but they were evacuating the planet. She had time for a costume change? And she decided to go elegant instead of utility uniform that would actually be much more realistic. 

Also how would Luke know to be wearing Jedi robes on the day that Rey arrives but then immediately change into a different outfit soon as she gets there?  

I actually love the last Jedi. I think it was an amazing film. But I agree with Mark Hamill on these are not my Star Wars characters. But I think Mark acted the hell out of the role he did an amazing job anytime he was on screen.

What is the definiton of Sith?,"What qualifications makes someone a Sith? I tried making a post previously to logically make sense why Snoke and Kylo Ren are not the Sith.

People reasoned that they are a religion; but you see Ben Solo adhering to the Sith tenants by killing Han Solo and changing his name-declaring he has let go of his personal attachments. That is a major Sith tenant.

Snoke is intent on eradicating Luke Skywalker, who has posed no threat since he failed to return the Jedi. But Luke is interestingly his first priority simply because he is a Jedi. Sith are the ultimate enemies of the Jedi, with the Republic coming afterwards. 

The defintion of what made a person a Sith in legends constantly flexed, the Rule of Two was established by Darth Bane for a millennium. The Sith are not a race, but a way of life so it makes sense they are not necessarily erased forever just as the Jedi are not necessarily erased forever. They come and go. So are Snoke and Kylo Ren just parallel versions of the Sith (there are some differences from what I believe; ie Kylo definitely does not come off as Snokes apprentice he's just a tool just as Sidious used his apprentices as tools; in legends Sidious was seen as a Sith imposter). I see articles saying that Snoke may be worse than a sith but his strategems are a lot like Palpatines; hes just not as secretive or deceptive about it.",StarWars,True,1523731123,2018-04-14

I may be missing some crucial bit of info that makes this question stupid but still I'm interested in anyone's opinion.

Daisy Ridley: ""Who Rey's parents are did not change between the movies""

So a viewer is led to believe 'Oh of course they would deny Jango was a mando because they don't want anyone suspecting violent warrior mandos are still around'

Seems to me George Lucas had this random idea that dave half heartedly implemented and other sources seem to be contradicting. box art, character descriptions from Disney all say Jango was a Mandalorian it really seems to me this was an idea that was never clearly put on screen so everyone has ignored it.

"I really like the ST, but I wish it would have been set 40 later instead of 30.","It would just make things a bit better I think. 

The actors would look closer to the characters ages (Luke/Leia would be 63 instead of 53, Han 73). It would give them even more room for stories in the period between ROTJ and TFA.

And I think people in general would be a bit more accepting of the way some of the OT characters are handled. I don't have a big issue with it to begin with, since I never expected to see a 65 year old Hamill doing tons of actions scenes.. But I think that the idea of a Luke in his 60s as opposed to early 50s would have made some people more comfortable with him being less prominent. 

Otherwise, I think most stuff could be the same. Again, I really like the ST so far as is, and I'm pretty happy with Luke's ending. I just think that it could have been set a bit later.

Maybe he planned to do a clone of himself to keep bringing new apprentices to the Dark Side and keep the Empire alive in case he wouldn't survive. Therefore, Snoke already knew where to find an apprentice: In the Skywalker's lineage. In case this is true, maybe another Snoke clone could reappear, or another Palpatine's replacement. In that way, the whole saga would be about Palpatine's dragging the whole Galaxy into the Darkness, even beyond his own death.

Possibility of Clone Troopers (and other prequel content) being in Solo,"I've been wondering to myself in the last few months if we may see Clone Troopers again in this movie, because I was thinking there's a chance they could flashback to the Clone Wars when Han was just a kid, showing a battle and/or its aftermath where he lives. However, I think I would prefer Clone Troopers make an appearance in relation to Chewbacca. In Revenge of the Sith the Republic helped defend Kashyyyk from a Separatist invasion at the very end of the war, and then seemingly turned on the Wookiees. We could have some screentime showing Chewie in the battle and suddenly having to deal with the Republic's betrayal (they could throw in Yoda again if they really wanted or the other Jedi who was there), fighting off Clones, and eventually getting captured and enslaved by them. That'd be pretty cool if they thought a scene like that would help develop Chewbacca.

More likely though, we will see prequel content in the form of easter eggs and cameos. Since we will be in the criminal underworld, there's a chance we may see guys like Embo, Bossk, Dengar, Aurra Sing, IG-88, Cad Bane and Boba Fett. Maybe we will even see some underground gambling in the form of racing (podracers?) and fighting pits with creatures like Nexu. A guy trying to sell death sticks, perhaps. I wouldn't be surprised to see Clone armour and Separatist Droid parts in the background either, hanging like a prop on the wall. Any other ideas for prequel content in Solo?

Have you ever seen this zoomed-in look of Kylo Ren?,"Have you ever seen this image before?

https://imgur.com/gallery/9sel0

Is it me or it seems that in his eye, it looks a lot like his mother, the old hairstyle of Leia?

I was writing an article about the Kylo Ren's aggressiveness behavior and when I was seeing movie scenes to understand why he did get furious so many times I picked up that image in his eye.

The theory I worked on basically consists that Kylo Ren wants to kill Ben Solo because he sees him as weak and that means, being infuriated with his whole infancy.

So here, when he recalls a moment with his mother, he gets angry because he does not accept Ben Solo and needs to be more Kylo Ren, so he uses his angry to prove that he is powerful and not a weak abandoned child like Ben Solo.

The Netherworld of The Force,"After another viewing of The Last Jedi and contemplating the fate of Luke Skywalker, I started to wonder about the nature and reality of The Netherworld of The Force, of which Yoda spoke to Obi-Wan about and of which they are both inhabitants of.

It seems to me that The Netherworld (at least the one in which The Jedi inhabit) is completely devoid of something which holds the physical universe together - the dark side of The Force. This is purely speculation of course but if there were no influence of the dark side in this heavenly realm then it could mean one of two things:
 
1) The true nature of the universe is light, beauty and infinite wisdom - a state which the Jedi are eternally rewarded with after a life of reverence to that path.
2) Balance exists at every level of reality and therefore there may be an alternate version to this utopia for those who lead a life dedicated to the dark side of The Force.

The issue with the second option is that I'm sure George Lucas himself has stated that only Jedi can become Force ghosts. We have seen some EU content which contradicts this but as far as the movies go there is no evidence that dark side users can transcend into the netherworld at all - hence their obsession with prolonging life in the physical realm. 

I would love if one of the new films went into this further and we got to expand the rules on it. Do their spirits go back into human form, reincarnated or is Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Anakin there for as long as they want to be? The Force clearly forces the hands of individuals in order to maintain it's universal balance but does that apply in alternate dimensions too, even with a lack of the dark side? This also makes me wonder about whether The Force is conscious in its decision making or purely a reactionary power... but I think that's a discussion for another time. :)

I don't like the new idea that all it takes to use force powers is belief,"I've posted before on how the ST/OT and the PT/EU view the force and force powers. (https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/77bobh/the_problem_with_reys_powers_rules_based_magic_vs/)  The first set view it more as high fantasy like LotR or GoT where the force is a magic that can do what ever it is needed to do in a certin situation. And how the PT and EU (both current canon and Legends) treat the force more as a rule based system  where there are certain steps one needs to go though and where a person needs to have training to be able to use different aspects of the force (and both of these are talking about things beyond general precog and reflexes) eg Avatar and Harry Potter. 

I personally think its best to leave her powers as her being special because of the mind meld and being chosen by the force. That is the best way to handle it without messing up the rest of what we know about the force. Recently as a way to explain Rey's powers beyond just her mind meld with Kylo people like Pablo have been stating that all that is needed to use the force, even higher level force powers, is a belief in the force and that it can be done. 

Now in its simplest form this doesn't seem to bad. And it even seems to match with Yoda's ""Size matters not"" speech when he is trying to get Luke past what ever mental block he was having. And if we only had the OT to go on I would be a little more forgiving. But even then we have a problem with the ""only needs belief"" route. 

And that is Luke saw Obi-wan use the force. He saw Obi-wan mind trick someone and it still takes him four years to be able to do it. It wasn't like Rey who has just heard legends and tales of the Jedi. He had first hand experience and still couldn't do it. 

He also had to train and try to use Telekensis in the Heir to the Jedi book and at the end was only able to use it to move a small noddle and inch or less. And this is another power he saw in use in the comics. And yet with him knowing the force exists and seeing it used he doesn't have enough ""belief"" to do it?

And its even more insulting when we look at the PT. Now the first thing most people will say is that the babies could use the force to move small toys but this isn't to show how easy it is but to show that children are more attuned to the force than adults (like how babies have no fear of heights yet). But even with babies being able to do that they still have a whole academy to train them. 

And this is the part I find insulting. That a random girl in a desert has more faith and belief in the force than a order of monks steeped in 10,000 years of tradition. Yes on the surface it sounds kind of biblical but lets think about it. 

We know what kind of Jedi Obi-wan and Ahsoka and Caleb Dume and Anakin were. We know their struggles and abilities. This belief idea is saying that every time they failed to move something, to block a blaster bolt, to fly well enough they didn't believe in the force as much as a random girl who has only heard of Jedi in fairytales. The child batting away blaster bolts in RotS and all the Jedi who died in the war didn't believe enough. Every time a jedi fails its not to do with training or centering their emotions its because they failed to believe. 

Plus we have seen that Jedi do need to train. The Anakin and Obi-wan comic, AotC, The Clone Wars, Rebels, Heir to the Jedi, Weapon of the Jedi, Anh and ESB, all of them show Jedi training or talk about Jedi training. We even see in Vader the Inquisitors training. 

If Belief is all that is needed then they don't really need to be doing any training.  And if we are going with the idea of ""Well this is how the force works now"" then it invalidates all of those works and makes it seem like all of their failures came from just not believing enough (a phrase I dislike because I hear to many people in my own religion use it to state why people failed)

And all of this isn't talking about higher level powers. If belief is all it takes whats to stop some kid who just picked up a saber from pulling some Yoda or Palpatine level stuff? It seems like at least that would need some training before we see them pulling of huge stunts and sith sorcery. 

I hope the belife thing is just a Pablo fantheory and not something that is going to be canon. Because it will really mess things up imho. Its much simpler to say she is the new chosen one and got strong in the mind meld instead of going against all the other canon works. ",StarWars,True,1522702433,2018-04-02
What character had the lamest death in the movies ?,,StarWars,True,1522703991,2018-04-02
"I was one of those who hated TLJ, to such an extent I swore I would never watch it again. So I watched it again, and have upgraded my opinion","I don't hate it. I don't love it either, but I think I can narrow down the things that really bothered me about the movie better and extricate them from the things I really loved about this movie.

First of all after the initial viewing I hardly knew I liked anything about it at all. The things I disliked I dislike so strongly that it tainted everything.

A second viewing. I needed a second viewing to really discern what my actual overall feelings were about this movie, without the anger(yes I was angry) of the first viewing clouding everything.

What I discovered I liked:

Luke. Initially I wondered why he'd hide away, why he'd run and why he was such a(honestly) whiner. Well fact is Luke is human and he screwed up(as the Jedi themselves had). I liked his arc and I liked his end. How much more Jedi can you get than to win without fighthing?

I liked Rey vs Kylo. The dynamic between them is interesting and fun and they're both great actors. I'm looking forward to what happens with them next.

Maybe this doesn't sound like much, Luke, Rey and Kylo...but these three are the movie, basically. Everything else is a side show. They're fantastic actors, and the characters are amazing. Love it.

Which brings me to the other things that I simply didn't enjoy.

Finn and Rose. They are a giant anchor, dragging the story down. Finn is an irrelevant character in TLJ and has no effect on anything. Rose is tacked on too, as some sort of love interest. If you hacked these two out of the movie altogether it would get so much better. Think about it.

Vice admiral Holdo. She was so clearly shoehorned in, I imagine some executive listing off attributes needed by this character and the just thudded her down in the middle of everything and made her a hero. I found her character jarring and contrived and she took me out of the moment, wishing they'd given Admiral Ackbar that end.

The things that initially I felt strongly about have faded. Why don't we learn who Rey's parents are, why did they show Luke's xwing, why why why why. Minor problems really.

Having said that Luke, Rey and Kylo absolutely save this movie. Wonderfully acted and well written. So on second viewing I am hopeful for the finale, whereas in December if you'd asked me I might have spat on the ground. I put TLJ somewhere in the middle for my favorites, which is a massive upgrade. I'd encourage anyone who vowed ""never again"" to give it one more try.

Why Episode 8 is Episode 5,"Until yesterday, I absolutely despised Episode 8. I hated the directions Rian took, what he did to Luke Skywalker, that entire Leia scene. I enjoyed the phenomenal parts, the parts your would have to be insane not to like, such as the Rey and Kylo Ren lightsaber fight, but besides that? I hated it, and shutted out any thoughts of accepting it. At the expense of avoiding copying from Episode 5 like everyone accused Episode 7 of doing with the 4th, I felt that Rian took too many chances.

It just so happened that yesterday I also watched the commentary for Episode 5. Most of it was generally useless information, and it was just something that I was listening to in the background while browsing the web. Nothing I heard really stuck with me, until the end credits rolled. Of all people, Ben Burtt, the Sound Designer of Episode 5, said the only thing that actually stuck with me. I can't remember what he said word for word, but he talked about how, at the time, Episode 5 was faced with a bit of critism. It wasn't critically acclaimed and loved by fans, like Episode 4 (Episode 7) was. It wasn't reaching the amazing reviews that the first was. It didn't have a real ending, it didn't have something to make everyone feel good at the end. And at the time, there was no reason for the people to trust it, to love it, because it was the middle of an incomplete story. Now it's easy to look back and admire it, to see how well it connects the two stories and furthers the characters as people, but back then? There wasn't. 

Suddenly, I realized that that's what makes Episode 5 exactly like Episode 8. While it doesn't have scenes or structure that is a lot like the earlier movies, like 4 and 7, this one thing is enough to connect the two. But besides connecting them, it's given me a whole new appreciation for the movie, Episode 8. Instead of hating it, with semi-goof cause, I now realize that some of this stuff needed to happen for Epsiode 9, and some of the decisions that lead to an unfulfilling ending will eventually get wrapped up in an awesome climax during Epsiode 9. It amazing how that one line, not even by the Director but from the Sound Designer, changed my whole view about a movie that wasn't even in planning phase while the commentary was made.",StarWars,True,1522706256,2018-04-02
[Spoilers] Leia Organa appreciation: The Last Jedi.,"After all discussions Episode VIII has caused, I think something that has gone underappreciated is Leia's arc in the movie, as well as the development of her character since Return of the Jedi. Let me explain why I think Leia is the strongest character in all of the Star Wars universe for me.

Born a Skywalker and grown into royalty, Leia became over time a great warrior, just like her parents; a person whose strongest weapon was her will and determination to never give up on her beliefs, but always realizing where her limits and weaknesses were. However, it was not after Bloodline, The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi that she turned into my favorite Star Wars personality along with Ahsoka Tano. 

The sequel trilogy has given me just the conception of Leia I needed to fully understand her. We see in The Last Jedi how she has not given up yet even though she had lost almost everything and everyone close to her; we see how after all, she found a way to keep going foward.

With Ben turning to the dark side and the First Order rising, Han separated from her and Luke ran into exile while she organized and leaded a paramilitary group to fight it. Moreover, although she had every reason to be angry at them, she understood and forgave them. And then she lost them forever (even though 'no one is really gone'), but neither of their deaths were enough to make her quit fighting. Her whole family was gone (even Ben: 'I held out hope for so long, but I know my son is gone'), but Leia held tight.

You will find it *ironic*, but what made me realize where that strength came from was the commonly hated space scene. Watching Leia being thrown into the vacuum of space, dying alone, has been the only Star Wars scene that made me cry. I know, it may sound cringeworthy, but I just felt helplessness when I thought she was going to have an unfair ending. She could have just let go of everything and finally rest, but she did not give up; she found all the strength she had left and pulled herself towards her survival. I love the scene, and I love the way it was executed: Leia was royalty, a war veteran and an army General; she was experienced, and knew she could not doubt nor hesitate in a life or death situation. I understand why most of you find it cringeworthy, but I will always see it as a majestic way to demonstrate her fighter nature.

Finally, let's not forget about her humanity. I cannot stop myself from thinking that she could have saved everyone in the Raddus' bridge by just giving any order before the attack, as she knew what was coming, but decided to wait if her son would make or not his move. It was her feelings and hope for him what betrayed her. However, later on in Crait, she did not make the same mistake with Ben. The Last Jedi served as one possible final lesson for General Organa.

Knowing how her story is going to end, I can only say that either if she dies in a peaceful way or fighting, it would fit her perfectly. Personally, I would love to see Leia passing away peacefully, while she realizes how much she means for everyone, how much she has struggled for them and how much she deserves to finally rest.

How to bring Luke and Snoke back in a natural way for Episode 9,"You could have a side story of them in the afterlife

There both force ghosts, but this is where they are when theyre not speaking to people

He goes through a cycle of finding an aprentice, letting his aprentice kill him, and coming back as a dark force ghost (something new to canon there), where he uses the dark side to rip a hole in the afterlife and ressurect himself to start the cycle again to strengthen the dark side.


The jedi werent able to stop him before, since they couldnt force ghost, but this is the first time that they can, and luke is the only one strong enough to stop him.


Luke fights with snoke, only using foce powers and nearly looses, until Anakin saves him at the last minute and buys him enough time to go through the tear himself, locking snoke in the afterlife forever and bringing luke back to help the resistance

I probably know him better as a voice actor looking at some of his roles I recognize him for.

But maybe it is seeing him onscreen again gave me something I didn't know I missed.

Is Snoke actually dead?,"After watching The Last Jedi a couple of times today, Snoke's death has always bothered me. How could someone as powerful as him just die, especially when he can sense Rey and Kylo Ren from across the galaxy and connect them. In one of the scenes where Rey and Ben are speaking (the second one I believe) after they're done Kylo has water on him from the wave, even though he is across the galaxy. So, I can see 3 things happening. 1: It is a highly detailed illusion from Snoke, 2: It is matter teleportation through the force, or 3: It is matter creation. If it is 1, he could be across the galaxy from his ship on some secret planet making all of these illusions and the illusion he is on his ship. So, when he got cut in half that was just an illusion and was testing his apprentice to see what he would do. If it is 2, then it doesn't seem like it would tie in with his death.

BB-9E Appreciation,"I actually liked BB-9E. Sure, I know he (she?) exists solely to sell toys, but that's Star Wars.

BB-9E was given an unusual amount of personality on screen compared to other imperial astromechs.

We get close-ups of his face telling us what he's thinking and we even literally see through his eyes for a moment. [Look how he rolls in front and center when he catches Finn and Rose, how it's framed](https://i.imgur.com/w6xmdzL.png). He's proud of himself.

I hope to see BB-9E in the 9th Episode.  He may have survived. He could continue to be a bad guy. He could be Ben’s astromech if he turns and remembers that droids have feelings. Or maybe the writers will just forget that BB-9E ever existed, which is more likely. 😐",StarWars,True,1522727394,2018-04-02

"A discussion on the usages of Colors/Sound Design in Star Wars, Lucas's/Ben Burrt's involvement and Disney's treatment of Star wars.","Note: **Reddit seems to be messing up where I can't see this post and it says removed the instant I post it. Not sure If others can see it or not but this will be the third and final attempt.**

As I've been re-watching the films specifically listening to their intricate sound design, It is sad to say that the components of Lucas's Symphonic Harmony(A complex mixture of Visual, Auditory design and lyrical poetic-ism) have been stripped away from Star Wars ever since Disney's inclusion to input themselves into Lucasfilm. Of course this would have been inevitable at the end of the day even with more competent players creating the films but I do not believe for a second it would fall so low in quality in unique expression. I noticed the shift in tone when watching ANH and TPM compared to TFA.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJCXBevvrp0

Here, we can listen to(or watch) Burt's wonderfully made sound buy taking natural noise, reducing it original state to create something otherworldly and spiritual. Unique Gutted howls(0:01) so distorted and fit for an alien universe you would actually think Ben Burt traveled to Mars to get the material he needs for the movies. What happened? Who captured Ben Burtt?

He wasn't...He was denied to express as if he is to be used as a commodity to get the work done(""Work more and be happy"") a simple numerical value like 1138 himself.

“I don’t know if there’s bad blood,” he answered. “Nobody . . . I was just never consulted or hired to do any of them. No one’s ever told me why. No, I was told—on the new regime, I was just told, ‘Just stay in your room and make sounds and just send stuff to us. We’ll decide what to do.’” It was a change in philosophy that, Burtt thought, would “doom the whole process.”

It was a considerable demotion as well. Burtt was deeply involved in Lucas’s prequel trilogy, working as an editor and second-unit director in addition to his usual role in the sound department. “I had a lot of influence on all that,” he said. “It wasn’t always easy working with George, but at least it was one voice. And you could get his attention and have your say and present something and get a yes or a no. But it was just one person you had to get past. Not banks of different people who want to have a say.”

Something to note; It's never always easy with Editors and Directors when they are making films, which is a good thing and quite common:p

Just ask Quinten: )

The colors are largely bold and primary but of Lucas's films but lack a meticulous color palettes to compliment the films visual focus. Magenta's, Light Pink, Demonic Red, Ocean Blue etc. All of the colors of humanity is right here within the Lucasian Saga.

https://laughingsquid.com/a-visualization-of-color-palettes-used-in-star-wars/

I sadly do not have a video for TLJ but I can say it now that it's largely the same as TFA with hints of a little more ""umph"" than the former but it isn't saying much. In this video we can observe Lucas's six movies and how he uses color to tell a story and explain how the characters work without relying so much on dialogue or overt camera zooms. It's a very stilted film style reminiscent of the 1950's with masterful touches of vast emotional power being driven into the film of extreme mental actively despite not being in motion all the time. It's as if Lucas's is asking; ""Are you now? Or are you ever?"" The 1138 is what Lucas has given us in Cinema's history. I guess that's over now for Star Wars?

Another example, with this time ""in-motion paintings""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9-K1cxj6IQ

There is so much density within these sequences here it overwhelms the mynd.. Motifs, themes, musical collaboration and slight poetic-ism being expressed all at the same time! Gee Golly! Anakin's literal ""90' Degree Downward Fall"" before his Emotional ""360 Degree Turn"", followed by another 90' degree angled fall into hell(Mustafar)

Techincally is more so 45 as he rolls into lava but when he's cut down, he falls straight down.

https://youtu.be/k3frK9-OiQ0?t=469

A downwards spiral by his own submission into his own hellish ""nightmares"".

I've been really trying to understand the purpose and ""depth"" the ST has providing me with. I can't find it. None of it actually exist in my mind and when I get the feeling that it's extending into something existentialism like Lucas's films, I only feel that way all due to the ""mirroring"" it does like Kylo Ren's ""Fireplace"" sequence as a means to tie in Ben with his grandfathers romantic struggle in AOTC. But it doesn't work when I consider the context of said scene, same with the ""Ripped"" scene from ROTJ which also doesn't make sense in context.

Can someone, anyone who is a fan of the ST give me a reason why I shouldn't judge these films less than Lucas's? Excluding the story, dialogue and characters, what reason should I praise these films to a large degree like many when they don't even have Star War's core heart? The Technological aspects is just as important as the characters in my own perspective, why shy so far away from it and why keep the originators away?. Without such lovely additions to cinema itself I find the films duller and a little lifeless in comparison. It's a mangled Frankenstein of a flesh-y/mechanical heart.

In some ways, I find certain aspects wonderful in the ST. Kylo Ren's Design in TLJ is so directly purposeful to resemble Padme and Anakin I don't think you can deny it's innate essence nor the prominent direction of Finn as a whole during the beginning of his ""Awakening"". As a friend of mine who described TLJ to me in his own words;

[I like TLJ because it is deliberately, pervasively, undoubtedly DANK, i.e., disagreeably damp, musty, and typically cold. The word ""dank"" most likely etymologically derives from a word meaning ""marshy spot."" It's kind of like the secret grotto that Rey falls into. The focus is on ""atmosphere,"" whereas TFA was more ""texture."" I suspect that Episode IX will round out the ""aptitude"" part of this touchy-feely trifecta of mysterious cinematic qualities.]

Lack of toys/ships/ fine addition to my collections,"So this is just a personal gripe for me. I have collected Star Wars capital ships since I first saw the Phantom Menace. I was beyond excited when the new movies just came out to add some more fine additions to my collection but honestly I've been kinda disappointed. After seeing Rogue One I thought for sure The Profundity would be on sale to collect but it was just lies and deceptions. So I waited for The Last Jedi and I was excited to get either old man Snokes ship or the shieldless wonder Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought maybe at least duel wielding bridge Raddus, but atlas my hopes and dreams were sucked out into the cold lifeless space that Admiral Akbar now resides in. Not only that, I've noticed that when I go to Target or Walmart with my girlfriend and look for anything other than the first wave of toys Im always fat out of luck. Along with that, all of those toys are on discount because everyone that wants the first line of Star Wars toys got them before the movie came out. You would think that Disney would pump out all the toys they can for one of their top tier franchises but whatever Disney, you do you.

Pacing problems in the Sequels,"So I just got around to watching TLJ again last night. I do enjoy it despite its flaws, but I noticed something else that bothered me a little.

Without going into spoilers, I felt like The Last Jedi has a little issue of pacing. Without the element of surprise on the second viewing, I felt the middle part of the movie dragged quite a bit. The opening battle is fantastic, and the entire final act is GREAT, but besides a little chase scene in the middle (which is not as interesting as the other action scenes), the movie is a little slow. The Last Jedi almost seems more of a drama with some action scenes rather than an action movie with some drama in it.

On the flip side you have the Force Awakens, which I feel like every scene is rushed. There is no time for the characters to breath: 1. Kyle appears in a fight scene. Finn's departure happens before we even know the character to get to a dogfight scene (2). Rey gets a little time to develop, but then is rushed to the Falcon in the market fight/ TIE attack (3). Finn, Rey, and Han then have barely any time to meet before a monster attack (4). Our heroes manage to make it to a cantina, where yet again, they are attacked (5)...

I could keep going, but I find it interesting how different these two movies are. I felt like the Force Awakens felt rushed and The Last Jedi a little slow. Both struggle with pacing, but in opposite ways. While I have do not care much for Rogue One because I did not connect much with the characters, I felt like it had GREAT pacing in comparison. 

Personally, I think I enjoyed the more character driven Last Jedi. Anyone else feel this way?",StarWars,True,1522762167,2018-04-03

Finn: Do you know what happened to him?

Han Solo: A lot of rumors. Stories. People that knew him best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.

BUT.

Why did RJ have Luke brush his shoulder off after being fired on? I felt like that didn't even fit his character in the film (hermit Luke).

And why didn't RJ include the ""Luke has a Moment"" scene? Even after hearing the commentary with the deleted scene, he still made it sound like it should have been included. This scene, along with the throne room (after the battle with the guards) were the most emotionally vulnerable parts of the movie. I feel like both were necessary.

So no one has an issue with our lead woman (Rey) curing a broken man (Ben) with her sexuality? [MAJOR TFA AND TLJ SPOILERS],"This is honestly one of the smaller issues I'm having with the ST. But 'Reylo' is everywhere at this point, so it's impossible to avoid thinking about it if you want to have ST discussions.

But does anyone else find this a tiny bit weird? We're introduced to our first female lead in a Star Wars film in TFA and is was very important to a lot of people. And the film got a lot of praise for how it handled Rey and made her *so* self reliant and subverted a lot of gendered tropes we'd see in big budget action films. I also distinctly remember most of the Star Wars fanbase saying that a romance would take away from her character. Then The Last Jedi came out and literally all of that went away. 

I won't mince words, I hate TLJ. But Rey and Kylo are getting together. No way around it. And I can't not hate it because we're right back at this incredibly gendered trope of this pure woman curing a broken, violent man with her sexuality. 

I'm bringing up her sexuality because, frankly, with the dynamic the way it is, that's *all* she has to offer Kylo and that's all he has to offer her. At this point. I am of the mind that if Kylo couldn't be redeemed by his father, his uncle, or his mother (which can't happen now) then I don't see why Rey would be able to redeem him. Other than the fact that she gets his dick hard. Rey runs to Ben in a moment of isolation and loneliness on Ahch-To. BTW, this wasn't earned at all. But whatever. But that was a *moment*. She felt lonely. TLJ shows that she doesn't need to be. She surrounded by people that care about her and know who she is. Contrary to what Kylo told her, she *is* a part of this story and she isn't nothing. She's something to a lot of people. So what does Kylo have to offer Rey other than the fact that he's hot? They're both Force users? Okay? That means nothing.

That might very well be all you need. But that seems counter to how deliberately characterized Rey was in TFA in order to avoid some of these gendered tropes and they seem to be going back on all of that and making this yet another story about a pure, innocent woman that loves hard enough to bring even the most insane man back from the brink. I just don't think it plays as well. Even Disney's new B&amp;tB remake took a few steps to try to modernize this story a bit and make it less ""Stockhold Syndrome"". We'll see how they handle this in EPIX, but it doesn't seem to me like both of these characters are on a level playing field. 

Rey getting with Kylo is basically a sacrifice of all of her friends and her life, as she knows it, to *maybe* fix this dude. That just doesn't play well in a modern story.",StarWars,True,1522770157,2018-04-03
Why do the new movies feel so small?,"Its a big galaxy right? Surely the scale of what we're being told is happening could be shown on screen? 

The movies feel so small, alarmingly so, the world building doesn't exist; what happened? 

The Prequels felt massive in their scope. It felt like a galactic conflict. It didn't feel centered, it felt more nuanced (I guess I say that part in hindsight, at the time nuance was the wrong word to use). Even Rogue One felt like it depicted a Rebellion operating all over the place, not just one tiny moment in one tiny place. 

It just feels odd. I watched TLJ last night, and everything felt almost cramped. Hell, I felt like Blade Runner 2049 was on a much larger scale, and felt like a far more active world despite being set in approx. one state, and mostly in just one city.

"After some time, and rewatching, where does TLJ rank for you all time?","tl;dr; I love TLJ, a lot, and I probably rank it 2nd or 3rd favorite of all time. May the force be with you.

/edit Where does it rank for you with the other Star Wars movies?

The more times I see this movie the more I love it. I'm in my mid-30s and I grew up watching Star Wars on video cassette (my first time seeing it was at 16 years old. I was obsessed. When the special editions came out I gleefully saw them all in theaters. I was excited when the prequels came out and I enjoyed them, though I never really loved them the way I did the originals. Then TFA came out and I don't think I have ever been that excited for a movie. I remember tears of joy rolling down my cheeks at the end of it. They were tears of joy and relief, relief because it lived up to my own hype I had created in my mind. It was a fun rollercoaster ride filled with so much nostalgia, perhaps even a bit too much but I understand why they did it, at the time there was so much pessimism about the prequels. TFA could have been even better but I loved it nonetheless and I was of course so excited for TLJ. Then I finally saw it and...

I remember the first time I saw it I came out of the theatre after having seen TLJ kind of stumped, it was that unexpected and of course I had my own head cannon completely crushed. I didn't quite know how to feel about it, what had I just seen? There was a lot I liked about it but I felt confused, like something just hit me out of left field. I always knew I was going to see it multiple times, so after the second viewing I started to understand it a bit more, the messages, the themes, the intended audience (it's for the kids, dummy!). After the third time in the theater I was in love. Now that it's out on bluray I've seen the movie 2 more  and of course all the extras and bonus features. My appreciation for this movie just grows with each viewing. Rian Johnson ""gets"" Star Wars. Star Wars in for the kids and the kid within all of us, it's a coming of age story with a heavy dose of mythology.

TLJ draws on so many familiar elements while being completely unexpected and new in some regards. I love Luke as the wary and worn out old teacher who thinks he may have created Kylo Ren himself. I love the overall message of failure and hubris of this movie, everything from Poe's terrible plan, to Luke's failure as a teacher, and of course Snoke's overestimation of his ability and power. I loved the similarities of the battle of Crait to the battle of Hoth. I loved Yoda showing up giving Luke one more lesson, ""the greatest teacher failure is."" I loved the intense battle both in the beginning of the movie and on Crait. I loved how Luke came out and did the most Jedi thing one could do, while showing off just how incredibly powerful in the Force he is, then going out with the twin sunsets. Visually the movie is absolutely stunning beginning to end, the light speed kamikaze, everything on Crait, Luke's island, the whole tree burning scene with Yoda, even Canto Bight is just gorgeous with it's shiny surfaces and amazingly designed creatures and characters. I could go on, and in the comments I probably will, I loved so much about this movie.

[Spoilers] An idea for a future Leia's novel and the beginning of Episode IX.,"As the imminent destiny of Leia is coming closer, I have been thinking about how I would like her farewell from the saga to be.

What if her death is not shown in Episode IX, but instead we are told in a future novel about her last moments and demise? It could be written by Claudia Gray, making it the perfect oportunity for ending her trilogy about Leia (which started with Bloodline and Princess of Alderaan). Personally, I would love to see on it how Leia goes back to all the defining moments of her life and finally realizes that she needs to rest after all she has fought for the galaxy.

Later on, in episode IX, it would be amazing if Leia's theme slowly started after the opening crawl and we attended her funeral in the first place. Going deeper, I would really like to see it being celebrated in Chandrila (as Alderaan was destroyed and Chandrila is were the New Republic 'was born'); it would also serve as a reintroduction to Mon Mothma (she retired to her home planet -Chandrila- from being Chancellor before Episode VII), who would give the Resistance the speech they need to restore their hope and keep fighting for the galaxy.

I just wanted to share this cool list of all the recanonized Legends material that has been collected on the Star Wars Reference Sub,"https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsReference/wiki/cliffnotes/recanonized

As a Legends fan I'm always happy when Legends stuff makes its way back into the canon. And due to many of the people who worked on Legends (Filioni, Pablo, Jason Fry, etc) still being with Lucasfilm we are seeing a lot of things pulled over into the new canon. 

Everything from small miniscule things like Xim the Despot, S-thread boosters, E-wings, and species names to larger more important things like whole species or events or most well know people like Thrawn and Pallaeon. 

They seems to be taking some of the best of Legends along with a lot of the world building that it did (planet names, species, Old Republic History) and using it to give a bit more depth to the NEU as it creates its own history. 

Its not a complete list as new stuff is alwasy being added. Also their are some things that are really really close to their legends counter parts but are far enough away to not be included on the list. Such as the mining guild ore crawler from Rebels which is just a scaled down world devastator.

"If they had a different approach to Luke's weakness, do you think it could have worled better for people?","I'm fine with the idea of Luke becoming disheartened, I just didn't really like the image of Luke Skywalker standing over a defenseless, sleeping person with a lightsaber drawn. I believe if the scene was left more ambiguous, it would have sat better with many people. The way I imagine it, Luke tells Rey about it happening, but we don't get a flashback. Luke has a grainy hologram recording of himself and Kylo at odds with eachother, Luke is trying to confront Kylo about Snoke, while Kylo is angry and believes Luke is scared of him, like his parents. Suddenly both Kylo and Luke pull out sabers and clash at almost the exact same time, then the hologram ends. Luke says he could feel Kylo was going to attack and drew his saber, and says he's ashamed that he was wrong since he ignited it slightly before him, and in that moment he saw the suffering and stuff Kylo would cause and yada yada. Later on when Kylo tells his version, he says how Luke was ready to cut him down and he had to act because he searched his feelings and sensed the fear Luke had of him. I believe it could work because it lets the audience fills in the blanks of how they came to this rather than showing Luke walk up to Kylo while he's sleeping, ignite his saber, then turn it off. It seems like walking up and standing over Kylo requires a lot more thought than a ""moment of weakness,"" while having a heated argument is much more plausible to one. Besides, it was weird having flashbacks introduced 8 episodes into the 9 episode saga. I dunno, I'm not a movie maker.",StarWars,True,1522776020,2018-04-03

Luke Skywalker is not a coward: An examination of the Force in The Last Jedi.,"Right off the bat, this is going to be long 'and' what is merely my own interpretation of what's going on in the universe of Star Wars in regards to the Force and the actions of Luke Skywalker, Snoke, Rey and Ben Solo.  

There has been a lot of yelling that the actions of Luke Skywalker regarding Ben Solo, Kylo Ren, ultimately resulting in the destruction of the Jedi Order and his own self-imposed exile.  

It's been said that his actions were cowardly, irrational and illogical.  That it made no sense for him to go 'there' if he merely meant to go off and die.  

After a few viewings and some idle reading into the novelization and some other minor sources, I came to realize the opposite.  Luke's actions were directly responsible not just for the results of The Last Jedi.  

Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master, was the one who woke The Force.

We're going to be going at this chronologically speaking.  Everything I mention here is canon, from the novelizations, the movies or other canon sources.

After the fall of the Empire, before he set about creating a new Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker went to the Unknown Regions where he stumbled across Snoke.  Not physically, but through the Force.  Snoke hid himself as Sidious had hid himself.  As a result, Luke merely felt the presence of another Force user, not a Dark Side user in particular.  They shared information, they were cordial with each other.  Luke had, at this point, decided 'against' recreating the Jedi Order.  Snoke found this to be wise, as he understood the Force in a way that Luke had yet to fully understand.  

Now, we jump ahead to The Last Jedi, where Snoke is gloating over Rey.  ""The Darkness rises and the Light to meet it.  I warned my young apprentice that as he grew in strength that his equal in the Light would rise.   Skywalker, I assumed.  *Wrongly.* ""

Let's look at that statement.  The 'darkness' isn't Snoke.  It's Ben.  Snoke is his Master, but he 'admits' that he believed that Skywalker, the Last Jedi, was Solo's equal.  

Why did he assume this?  Because the entire history of the Light and Dark is one of opposition, betrayal and internal conflict.  From the very beginning, the Darkness rises and the Light, to meet it.  Every time.  It's a continuous, never ending cycle.  

Now, we fall back to the time of the new Jedi Order.  Luke has recreated it almost entirely because Leia and Han beg him to train their son, who they know is strong in the Force and, they fear, susceptible to the Dark Side.  He hadn't wanted to do it, but he knew that Ben needed training.  He didn't realize that Snoke had already begun reaching out to Ben, tempting him.  

So, here's Luke, recreating the mistakes of the past.  He's fallen into the cycle of the Force.  Darkness rises, and the Light to meet it.  Ben, the strongest user there aside from Luke, grows in the Dark Side and eventually Luke falls into that trap of rising to meet it.  They come to blows and Kylo Ren is born.

Luke realizes sometime in there that he failed and he failed because he went against his own better judgement and tried to recreate the Jedi Order.  More to the point, I suspect he begins to recognize the signs here, he finally sees the pattern.  Darkness rises, and the Light to meet it.  Ben is the Darkness and he is the Light.  

Luke has, for his entire life, been a conduit for the will of the Force.  He was plucked from obscurity to be the tool of the Force to balance the Sith 'and' the Jedi.  To end both.  To bring it all to an end, to bring that eternal conflict to a close, finally.  And he 'did' end the Sith...but, he tried to recreate the Jedi.  Out of love for his family, for the sake of a young boy that he cared for.  And so, the cycle of conflict was reborn.  

He realizes this, he finally understands.  The Force will empower him, to have him rise up to meet the Darkness that is Kylo Ren...and kill him.  Or be killed in turn.  Luke, finally aware of the cycle, of the pattern, has no intention on continuing this cycle of violence and destruction.  

So, what does he do?  *He cuts himself off from the Force.*  He disrupts the cycle.  There is Darkness rising...and no Light to meet it.  He removes himself from the equation, he understands that there's more at stake here than just a galactic moment between the First Order and the Republic.  Both groups are just momentary actors on a galactic stage, while the Dark and the Light have waged war on each other for thousands upon thousands upon thousands of years.  If he takes up that mantle again, the cycle is perpetuated and nothing of consequence is accomplished.  If he takes up that mantle, he would likely be able to challenge, defeat and possibly kill Ben Solo...but the pattern is reaffirmed and the Darkness will continue to rise.  

Instead, he removes himself from the equation, he cuts himself off from the Force.  The Force cannot empower him, the Force cannot use him as its champion of the Light.  

But, the Darkness rises...and the Light must rise to meet it.  And without a champion to meet Kylo Ren...the Force must *awaken*.

""There's been an awakening.  Have you felt it?""  Snoke, recognizing the Force as it stirs itself.  The Force stirred and reached out to find new champions.  Not just Rey, we saw as much in The Last Jedi's end scene.  When it awoke, it awoke inside them.  The Light needed a champion and so it found one.  

*By refusing to play the part that the Force wanted, Luke Skywalker caused the Force to reach out for a new champion to balance Ben Solo.*  

What Luke didn't expect, however, was for the Force to try again.  The pattern persisted, demanded.  It still wanted Luke as its champion.  So, Rey, guided by the Force, found him on his island.  Having refused to have any part in the conflict any longer, he was now confronted with a new apprentice that he didn't want, and a repeating of an old plea that had stirred him to action all those years ago.  What he found with Rey terrified him.  The possibility of another Kylo Ren.  He still saw things through the lense of the Light/Dark dichotomy.  He didn't realize that Rey and Ben both are not your typical Force users.  But, that's a different theory for a different day.  

Rey's attempts to coax him back to his status of champion were refused, so she left him there.  And, after a fight with Ben Solo, that would-be apprentice finally accepted her role as champion of the Light.  Darkness rose, and finally, finally, the Light to meet it.  

Once that was done, once she chose to be that equal and his match in the Force, Luke was free to embrace the Force again, freed from that pattern, free to go back and protect the Rebellion when all hope seemed lost.  

By refusing to play the role that the Force demanded of him, he stirred the Force to awaken itself and find a new champion, one outside of the pattern of eternal conflict, one that would hopefully break that pattern.

Let's talk about the Erso family for a minute...,"I just finished reading both Catalyst and Rebel Rising and damn. I loved both books, and loved the insight given to the back story of House Erso. Especially how crappy a hand they were dealt overall. ESPECIALLY Jyn. I'm going to watch Rogue One with completely different eyes now, knowing what she went through between the ages of 8 and 21-ish. The Empire took everything from her, and what poetic justice it was to have her be the one to help initiate their eventual downfall. 

If I could have even half the courage and strength both Lyra and Jyn had, I'd be doing alright.

"Stubborn Fan Finally Gives ""The Clone Wars"" a Shot","I finally finished watching the ""Clone Wars"" TV series, and I actually ended up really enjoying it.

For context, I grew up with the classics on VHS, loved the prequels as a kid, and greatly enjoyed Genndy's animated Clone Wars series. But when Dave Filoni's ""Clone Wars"" movie released, I was greatly disappointed. Wasn't a fan of the animation style, wasn't sure about Ahsoka, etc.

I've noticed the praise the series has received among the fanbase, but I never sat down and tried it out until this year. I'm glad I did. 

It was great taking in all the stories about the clones, Anakin and Obi, but it was also satisfying watching the show itself evolve over time. And yes, I eventually came around to liking Ahsoka. The way her story ended even got this skeptical fan a bit misty-eyed. 

Still not sure about Rebels, but I guess I'll need to give that a fair chance as well. Cheers!",StarWars,True,1522780027,2018-04-03
Honest question. Are artistic choices holding the Sequel Trilogy back?,"I've been thinking about this, and I've come to the conclusion that art could be partly to blame for holding the ST back. It almost feels like in an attempt to make us feel like it's the same universe as the OT has limited the sequel trilogies artistic freedom.

 We start the trilogy on Jakku (or shit Tattooine) and the similarities only get worse from there. The ship design is brutally unoriginal, with the FO taking the same approach as a child creating their ultimate superhero (just make the old one bigger, faster and more powerful without compromising anything) to the final battles' in both episodes being blatant rip offs of the death star and Hoth in the case of Crait.

If you asked me, I'd say the biggest redeeming qualities in the PT was the beautiful artwork. I really think 9 needs to inject some creativity into it's design (here's to hoping the knights of Ren end up as awesome as I'm anticipating). Especially considering the improved visuals and how stunning some of the cgi in the ST has been.",StarWars,True,1522780659,2018-04-03

An essay I wrote at 3 am last night about why the death star plans weren't just uploaded to the internet,"It's possible that the amount of data in the Death Star plans was large enough that it couldn't be broadcast efficiently. The size of the Death Star being what it is, even relatively abstract or incomplete plans would be enormous files, and it's not too much a stretch to imagine that Star Wars communications are limited by transmission rates. With holograms, at least, the amount of visual data transferred seems to be small, lacking even colour, and are clearly choppy. This may not be much to go on, but it's a start. If the plans were all that large, whatever communication system was available on the Tantive IV may not have been sufficient to deliver it to the galactic internet in time.

There's also the diplomatic angle here, one that many forget. Releasing the plans onto the galactic internet would also have broadcast the guilt of Alderaan's House of Organa as rebel traitors. Leia goes to lengths to prevent exactly this, in sending R2D2 and C3PO to Tatooine, sending away the plans to maintain plausible deniability, even if everyone involved knew that they'd had them. The House of Organa at the time was a part of Imperial Senate, and were at least supposedly loyal, if a notable opposition voice.
The Senate is not something we hear much about in the original trilogy, since it gets dissolved permanently part-way through episode 4 and is never mentioned again, but it wasn't irrelevant while it existed. It still served as a forum, even without formal authority, and its members carried notable prestige. Dissolving the Senate was seen as a driving force behind rebel recruitment, since the Empire could not maintain even the pretension of serving the common interests. It had been transformed fully into a dictatorship for Palpatine's personal rule.

The House of Organa was of course one of the founding members of the rebel alliance, but this was secret. The Alderannians were pacifists, and used this as a smokescreen, giving them diplomatic cover for missions that might otherwise have been viewed with greater scrutiny, greater suspicion. Leia spelled this out to Vader in A New Hope. Broadcasting the plans would sacrifice this at the exact moment the rebels were most vulnerable, just as they were in the direct line of sight of the Empire's new Death Star. Obviously, Leia's attempt at cover didn't work, as the Empire simply didn't need to care anymore, no longer obstructed in any way by the Senate, and her home planet was summarily destroyed.

Unfortunately for us viewers, computers and how they're linked to one another is not discussed at any length in the Star Wars universe, but what we see suggests poorer connections than what we on Earth are used to, at least on the inter-system scale. Even droids to connect to larger systems have to connect physically, which may fit neatly into the notion that the amount of data transferred regularly by droids and ships may be too much for whatever wireless connections possessed in the galaxy, though that is still speculation. Certainly, no single common internet-style network is ever mentioned, and there are certainly other plot holes such a network could have filled, such as live-tweeting the blockade of Naboo, which would have eliminated the cover of plausible deniability that surrounded the chancellor's government during the events. The rebels may not have had the option to upload the plans to anywhere meaningful. And even if they'd done so, an overbearing surveillance state like the galactic empire would easily have had the power to trace any suspicious bits of data, especially given they'd be on high alert after having top-secret plans stolen.

Putting such information online would also have meant essentially making the plans for the most dangerous weapon in the galaxy open-source. The Imperial government is probably not the only organisation with the resources to build a Death Star, and even if they are, one doesn’t need to actually build an entire aircraft carrier to make use of the technologies involved. The Death Star was a specialised tool, made for troop carrying as much as being a superweapon. Its volume, even when assuming absurd amounts of personal space for every soldier, would allow for trillions of people to be moved system to system in a single efficient leap, rather than in enormous fleets of star destroyers and other carriers. Someone looking to exploit the principles of its central superweapon may have no reason to do that, and so put less-powerful yet still-potent versions of it on smaller, more maneuverable crafts, or even ground-to-orbit platforms. There are probably thousands of other technologies and engineering secrets and systems built into the Death Star that we have no idea might exist that likewise could be exploited by those unfriendly to the rebels, such as gangsters like the Hutts or yet unknown and more dangerous factions and actors. This would not have served the rebel’s interests, however it played out.

Hundreds of Jedi survived order 66 and were eventually hunted down in the great Jedi purge. Sidious (at least in the EU) became CRAZY strong after RotS. Yet Yoda despite losing pretty much stalemated and held his own against him and in my eyes was a little less if not just as powerful. My question is, why didn't Yoda get Obi Wan to recalibrate the warning code for remaining Jedi to regroup somewhere. Yoda was still extremely powerful, Obi wan was still the master of Soresu and many of the Jedi had become experienced commanders in fighting the clone wars.

"Opinion: Please Stop Glorifying, Condoning, and Upholding Ben Solo","This might be a somewhat unpopular opinion. It also might be fairly political (not the government kind), but Star Wars is based in real-world politics. Additionally, TW/CW for discussions on violence. Also, wall of text. I'm sorry. It didn't start out this way.

TL;DR: Ben is a terrible person who is responsible for his choices. The burden isn't on Rey to save him with her ""love"" as that takes away the responsibility of the damage from the abuser and aggressor.

---

Ben is an awful person who doesn't deserve redemption. Anakin didn't really either. They're both responsible for the choices they made. I think that's lost on a lot of people who make excuses for Ben's behaviour. He's about 30 years old in TFA/TLF. He was in his mid-twenties when he murdered his peers. He's not some misguided teenager.

Anakin and Ben both did terrible, terrible things. (The following is going to sound super harsh, but I think it was done on purpose.) Ben is, almost literally, Star Wars' version of a school shooter. There are a lot of parallels tying to mental health and modern-day violence towards peers, mentors, and parental figures. Star Wars has always had elements of social commentary in it and this is one of them. Regardless of what you think about the direction of the films, I think it's important to not overlook this.

I get what Star Wars is about — it's about families — and I know people may want to bring up Luke and Anakin in this. I get it. Because of the Force, it's very easy to say that the dark side and the other villains are responsible for much of what happened to these two characters. From a movie perspective, that's absolutely correct, but that doesn't justify it. Luke's hope and optimism led him to try and save his father and they might try to do something again with Rey and Ben. However, I really don't think they will and I definitely don't think that's right. In TLJ, it's said that Ben is beyond hope by his mother. Luke saying that ""no one is every truly gone"" isn't seemingly about saving Ben (as he later states to him when confronted), but rather about loving who he was.

When Luke confronted his father, he didn't want to fight him. He didn't want to fight Ben, either. That's just who Luke is. Ultimately, though, he did fight his father as the dark side took a hold of him, namely his anger and fear. In the end, though, it wasn't his love for his father that stopped him from killing him; he didn't know him well enough to love him. It was his hope for a better future (including for his father) and his commitment to being true to the Jedi way — doing what is right rather than submitting to darkness.

Rey is a very different character than Luke, as is Ben compared to Anakin. For Rey, she's much more individualistic and, based on most of what we've seen so far, she doesn't seem explicitly determined to save Ben, but rather stop him. She tried for a bit before confronting Snoke, but after that she stopped when Ben tried to turn her. For Ben and Anakin, Anakin turned to try and save someone. His love and fear for someone else was contorted into a darkness that consumed him and blinded him. For Ben, it was more inward. He hated and feared what he assumed his parents thought of him and reached to the darkness for support. Snoke definitely manipulated him and much of how Ben turned out was due to Snoke, but at some point it has to become Ben's responsibility.

---

I apologise for how rambly this was. I just wanted to get it out there as it's been bothering me for a while. I have a lot more thoughts on this, so feel free to ask, criticise, and more to your heart's content. I'm just sort of tired of people babying this adult who has destroyed so many lives out of his own desires and choices.

Sort of as an aside, but I think it's also pretty disgusting to see people hoping that Rey and Ben get together. Ben is emotionally and physically abusive, a murderer, and more. Rey's ""love"" for him and her femininity aren't going to save him. It places Rey in the role of the emotional saviour to a troubled, abusive man. She's meant to be a lot more than that; that isn't her responsibility. People from Lucasfilms have done this, too, while alluding to the sexual tension between them ([one of a number of examples](https://youtu.be/p09c0MXDxto?t=14m8s) and a [second just for good measure](https://twitter.com/starwarstuff2/status/973334388057493512)), but I think that's incredibly damaging to Rey as a character and super sexist.

Edit: I feel like I should add some context to this, but I'm not sure how. I really like Ben and Rey as characters and I think the overall narrative is pretty good. I'm just being critical on this franchise because of how much I like it, which doesn't make me right by any means. These are just my opinions.",StarWars,True,1522797775,2018-04-03

If you hate the Prequels this post wont be for you...,"I grew in 1980 so my childhood was born in the OT. I was 19 when Episode I came out and the Prequels spanned my twenties. 

I’m very thankful I grew up when I did where I could enjoy the OT as a kid and the Prequels as an adult, but can’t help but feel like this new ST just doesn’t feel right. 

I have no shame in hiding the fact that I’m a HUGE OT fan and equally a HUGE Prequels fan. 

I remember when TPM came out, it was electrifying. I was finally getting to see the Galaxy, and the Jedi before the dark times, before the Empire. It was a story that was begging to be told, and with all its quirks, I still find the Prequels to be an incredibly compelling story on top of the universe and world it built which resembled nothing of the OT, but instead a Galaxy that was thriving, a Jedi order that was thriving, and a universe that had no clue what was about to happen. 

This new ST doesn’t give me that same feeling. I feel it’s a story being to make money, not because there was a story to be told after ROTJ. Everything feels forced. Everything that happens feels like a ‘because I say so’ moment. I don’t get that same sense of awe, and world building. I just don’t have the same proclivity towards the new characters as is did those in the OT and Prequels.

[Spoiler] Luke in The Last Jedi vs. Han in The Force Awakens,"One criticism I see of TLJ is that Luke's moment of weakness with Ben and/or his subsequent self imposed exile are an injustice to the character, that he never would have done that and that it completely undercuts his arc in the OT. Yet in TFA we discover that Han has ditched both his family and the resistance and is back to being as much of a scoundrel as he's ever been, and not once have I seen anyone claim that this undercuts his OT arc and ruins his character.

So what's the difference?",StarWars,True,1522800594,2018-04-03
Random alternative TLJ plot idea,"Let's say after victory in the original trilogy since Yoda said that Luke hadn't finished his training to be a Jedi he's still thirsty for more knowledge about the force and simultaneously now arrogant enough to believe he can study the dark side without being seduced by it but he's wrong and he get's turned by the same arrogance that let him take on the empire. Have Snoke be his alias and not a real character at all, in reality Luke is the one who turns Kylo by planting seeds of doubt and anger in Kylo's mind as ""Snoke"" and then in just the right moment when Kylo is on the edge and full of doubt Luke will pretend he's discovered what Kylo has been doing and attempt to kill him which forces Kylo's turn to the dark side. The reason he disappeared after Kylo's turn is that he couldn't go give fake condolences to Leia as their link is too strong and he wouldn't be able to hide what he has become from her.

Have the truth be revealed to Kylo in a scene where Luke kills Rey after she investigates the books on the island to discover the ""ancient jedi temple"" is really an ""ancient sith temple"" and her use her forcelink with Kylo to give him the reveal. So then you have a justification for Kylo to turn good as he realizes he was being manipulated by his uncle this whole time and you have Luke do something evil enough that the audience will buy him as the main villain.

Could it work?",StarWars,True,1522800773,2018-04-03

Sequel Trilogy is like a bad AAA game in some ways.,"Probably an unpopular view around here but, hear me out. I dont hate the ST. Actually enjoying it mostly, but in a way its like a bad AAA game in that the film content and story was fractured and some parts witheld purposefully from the audience in order to help sell the auxillary EU content such as comics/books. IE; The New EU is like paid DLC that should have shipped with the base game in many ways.

The difference between the Original Trilogy and the Sequel Trilogy (imo) is that in the past the EU *expanded* upon the core stories. Nowdays it seems to me that they focus more on filling in the plot gaps purposefully created by the film makers. 

In short, it feels like Disney is running this franchise like modern day AAA game developer. The kind who sell DLC that should have shipped with the base game. Just the feeling i get sometimes. ",StarWars,True,1522801261,2018-04-03

The Best Part about Snoke's death,"The best part about Snoke's death, to me at least.

When Ben ignites the light sabre and his expression changes to sheer pain. It is the moment when he *looks down* in surprise to see what has happened to him from the hands of Ben Solo.

My thoughts on The Last Jedi Disney lithographs,"I recently got my lithographs for The Last Jedi in the mail and wanted to share my feelings on them. For those that aren’t aware, by preordering The Last Jedi from the Disney Store, you get a free package of 4 lithographs from the film. These are high quality pictures perfect for framing and displaying. A link to the pictures can be found here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/68105287@N03/40703250981

In general, this is my least favorite set of lithographs compared to TFA and Rogue One. 

The first picture is of Rey staring at the ocean on Ach-To. This would be a cool picture... if it wasn’t of her back. The raw nature of the ocean draws a direct comparison with the raw nature of Rey’s connection with the force. The lighting also gives off a “dark side” vibe which Rey is tempted by through the movie. So an “artistic” picture, but it’s disappointing we can’t even see Rey’s face. 

The second picture is Kylos helmet with a half red half black background of Snokes throne room. This picture could be cool if it didn’t misrepresent kylo. He destroys his helmet in the first act of the movie! I’d much rather have a picture of helmetless kylo facing down snoke or screaming at Hux. 

The 3rd picture is probably my favorite since it gives recognition to Finn and Phasma during their awesome, albeit short fight scene. I’m glad they chose a picture of this fight as it was one of Finns most powerful moments in the film. 

Finally we got Chewbacca and a porg. This picture is a major disappointment. Don’t get me wrong, porgs are cute and a good marketing scheme for the movie. But the fact that Disney included a picture of a porg instead of Luke, Leia, Poe or Holdo is a big mystery. Especially since the lithographs for Episode IX definitely won’t have luke, Leia and holdo. 

I would have rather had these 4 pictures: the shot of rey and kylo back to back fighting the praetorean guards, the scene of Luke saying goodbye to Leia, Finn vs phasma, and the hyperspace ram shot. Honorable mentions could be a picture of Poe and holdo, or the walkers vs speeders on Crait. 

TL;DR pictures were ok but definitely could have been better.  What’s your opinion on the lithographs?",StarWars,True,1522806706,2018-04-03

I've seen Rogue One, but haven't finished Rebels, but Rebels so far is also doing a good job showing the **hope**lessness of the Rebellion. 

The more the odds are stacked against the Rebellion, the better A New Hope gets. All of these Rebels fighting don't stand a chance. Except they do, because out there, under the twin suns of Tatooine, there is a young man who holds/is the key to saving the galaxy.

To people hating on Rian Johnson and Snoke,"Saying Snoke ‘died before his time’ is asinine. In the original trilogy what do we know about The Senate (Palpatine)? He’s a creepy lightning guy with a weird laugh who got thrown down a tunnel to be sacrificed to the altar of character development (make sure not to think about the prequels, we’re talking solely original trilogy.) I would say we know almost as much about Snoke after two films as we knew about The Senate in three. He’s an old creepy guy with a weird laugh who can use lightning and is strong with the force who was sacrificed to the altar of character development. 
It took 20 years to get The Senates backstory in a movie and we will probably get Snokes in a canon book or something, if it even matters. He is what Palpatine originally was.

"Quick, genuine question about The Last Jedi","So Holdo's plan in The Last Jedi is to fuel up the small transports, utilize Rose's tech to hide their energy trace of said transports on any radars, and slip unnoticed onto the nearby, uncharted planet, Crait while the First Order is focused on the Raddus. My question is, sure no one would find the transports on any radar, but what's to stop anyone from just looking out of a window and spotting the transports escaping the old fashioned way. We know there are viewports on these ships and we know there are a LOT of crew members on those ships, particularly Snoke's flagship, so I imagine there's a pretty good chance at least one person might be looking out into space and see them and go running to an officer saying ""look out the window, they're escaping!"". I mean, we know the Raddus is close enough to Snoke's ship to be seen with the naked eye because he makes Rey watch the transports getting blown up. And I don't recall any debris or anything in space that the transports could be hidden behind. Is there any explanation for this? And is this ever addressed in the movie at all or in the book?

Closest thing we've seen so far is when Kylo force pushes Hux in TLJ and thats about it. 

So does the First Order have better working conditions then the Empire ? Are these killings forbidden in this new First Order ?

Recently watched TLJ (SPOILERS),"I was dodging spoilers and reviews about this  movie until now like a true jedi cause i wanted my movie experience unadulterated.

I don't know why, maybe it was the trailers or the posters, I was expecting Luke to become the real villain of the reboot. In mind I was expecting Ben swolo and Rey sue to join forces to fight against Luke. 

I was thinking it would be so awesome that Luke as powerful as he is finally accepts the path his father invited him on. Or something like yoda advises Luke to take over the dark path for the greater good i.e. joining of Ben and Rey, which would have been cool, cause then Luke would have been a villain not just for blowing shit up, but because to bring balance back in the far away galaxy, he had to become ""bad"".

However, this movie was quite far away from what I expected. I did not think the movie was bad, it's just the same thing like other star war movies.

Real talk: what would have happened if Rey said...,"... yes to Kylo Ren's pleas for companionship in TLJ?

I feel like, destroy the past is a good thing. We know it is because the Sith are evil and we know how barbaric the Jedi were as Luke confirms it by the deleted scene of the third trial.

Kylo wanted to make a new order, Rey would make a great companion to balance his evil half.

I don't know. I'm rambling and thinking.

Everything goes back to Dark Souls 2 for me.

""There is no path. Beyond the scope of light, beyond the reach of dark, what could possibly await us? And yet, we seek it insatiably, such is our fate...""

Vader needs to brutally slaughter a well liked hero,"A problem with Vader right now is that he's a 'cool' bad guy. Instead of wanting him to fail, you almost cheer *for* him. That scene in Rogue One is a great example: You should be sad that Vader is slaughtering a bunch of rebels, but instead you're in awe at how awesome Vader is at taking down a whole bunch of his enemies.

This is a problem because Vader is a villain, not a hero. Killing nameless extras does not make him feel like a villain.

Is TLJ a failure from a 'fanbase' point of view?,"I'm NOT talking about how good or not it was, so let's avoid that. 

I was not a huge fan of TFA, but whatever my quibbles with it it's pretty obvious it was a MASSIVE hit from a fanbase pov. What I mean is, the boards here on Reddit came to life, it had massive buzz, lots of fun discussions, my friends (and I ) were pumped arguing over possible directions the franchise would take, it had a high IMDB and RT Audience Score, etc. 

By and large, despite arguably being a bit unoriginal and paint by numbers, TFA succeeded tremendously from the ""fanbase"" pov, meaning it was exciting and fun to be part of the fanbase then and it was a growing universe with tremendous potential.

It seems to me that TLJ (whatever its merits as a film, and once again, LET'S NOT GO THERE) has failed in that regard.  The boards are incredibly acrimonious, Star Wars twitter is bombarded with hate, IMDB grade dropping (and reviews are dramatic), ditto RT audience score and review, anecdotally my friends (even the ones who loved TLJ) are just tired of Star Wars in a way I never would have imagined a few months ago.

Now when I think of SW, instead of 'fun', I just feel a bit weary and sad and tired. When I compare the SW subreddit to how it was before the film, it's night and day.  And it seems to me that if the goal of a film in a franchise like this is not only to be a good film in its own right, but also to add and build to a franchise (based on a fanbase), that TLJ failed in that regard.

What attracts you to the Star Wars universe if not the Skywalker Saga?,"Every movie we have to date explores the Skywalker Saga or expounds on events that furthered the Skywalker stories (Rogue One and Solo). Presumably, Disney will move away from stories related to the Skywalker lineage and expand the film universe. 

But the more I think about Star Wars, the more I feel like it's inherently connected with the relationships that have been developed for the past 40 years. Ben &amp; Rey's relationship/conflict (which, if we're honest, is the only compelling part of the new trilogy) is interesting on its own but becomes fascinating when you consider Ben's bloodline and what we've seen come before him. 

The consensus around here seems to be that Ben is the best part of the new trilogy. So what does that say about Rey, the ""nobody"", and on a larger scale, the future of the Star Wars universe?

Take away the Skywalkers and what are we left with? The Jedi/Sith struggle, intergalactic politics, laser swords and blasters. I'm not saying there's no new ground to cover, but that first trilogy that deviates from the established relationships will have a huge load to bear. Disney-funded flashy space operas will make hundreds of millions of dollars until the end of time, no doubt. But character-driven films will create rich universes that inspire Star Wars-like mania.

If you're angry I sympathize. This FAQ has been built exclusively around Luke's arc in The Last Jedi in the hopes of helping anyone hoping to enjoy it a little more to possibly do so. 

**QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE MASSACRE AT LUKE'S TEMPLE** 

* **Had Luke experienced Dark Side dazes before?** 

* Yes. Most notably perhaps in ROTJ in two incidents. Once when applying a Dark Side choke at Jabba's palace and later facing his father. In the second incident Luke realized he was fighting what he hates and stopped to save what he loved. He didn't want to become the worst of his father and regained control.

* **Why did Luke read Ben Solo's internet history? Errr... mind?** 

* Following instances where Dark Side tendencies were noted that Ben Solo likely tried to hide, as he later does with his new master Snoke, Luke realized the only way he'd get to the truth was when Ben Solo wasn't blocking his mind. In real world terms I liken this to him checking his internet history in his own temple. What he sees there is that his nephew is becoming an extremist right below his nose. He's experiencing this in his mind as though he's there and in a moment of pure instinct he reacts to fight what he hates and second later stops, lowers the saber and tries to use words to save what he loves. It's too late. Unlike ROTJ where it still worked out for him in the end... this time Luke faces consequence. 

* **Why does he have his saber with him?**

* As Master of his own temple he probably carried his saber with him everywhere. We see in earlier Star Wars films that most masters do.

* **Doesn't this mean that Luke accomplished nothing after ROTJ?**

* It depends on how you view things. He did accomplish a lot. It was also painfully taken from him by this saga's villain. The temple setup he built was substantive. That took time and energy and effort and resources. He was building something special there and doing what was asked of him. He'd taken on that burden to build a new Order and was doing so until it all came crumbling down. 

* **Is there any possibility that any of his students will survive this saga?** 

* Possibly. From a certain point of view Rey and Ben Solo are both his students and there's reason to suspect his relationship with Rey may actually be stronger heading into IX via Force Ghost. There's also the other students Ben took and the possibility of them being the Knights of Ren and the Knights of Ren being away on a mission and playing a larger role in IX. There are different ways in which Luke could have a legacy of students who come back to the Light following IX. 

**AHCH-TO QUESTIONS** 

* **Did Luke really want to go there to die right from the start?** 

* Despite Luke's statement of how he came there to die, and the state of mind he's in when we first meet him, we don't really know the specifics yet of when or why he first sought out the original Jedi temple. In new canon books we know that for years he's been seeking out Force knowledge and relics. Was it a place he was aware of prior to the destruction of the temple? A place he committed himself to finding after and did? Hopefully, we will get more on that because it could change the time span we perceive that he was even there at all.

* **Was Luke being cowardly?**

* Cowardice is a reaction to fear exclusively and conciously so I fundamentally reject the argument that fear is the single biggest reason Luke spends 6 years on Ahch-To. The bigger reason was one of the most established and explored aspects of Star Wars Force users in general: Internal conflict. It’s not conflict in the traditional sense of Dark Side thoughts versus Light but it is conflict about what is best for the galaxy and he’s incapable of working through it on his own and does the worst thing anyone in crisis internally can do. He shuts himself off from every possible counter perspective he can hear.

* **Could post-traumatic stress have played a role in his actions?**

* Absolutely. He wakes up to his life's work ruined. He built that temple and it's on fire. Young people he's likely spent years with are laying dead on the grass. If you haven't seen the actual still of this image from the film you should. It's different from what was in the trailers and graphic. The cycle of religious violence within his family continues again. How could that not be devastating? There are several aspects to it that could lead one to post-traumatic stress.

* **How would Luke have handled the events of the Original Trilogy if he'd shut himself off from all outside opinions?** 

* Good question. How many errors of judgement might he have made? The decision to shut himself off from everyone is crucial to understanding why it took him so long to work through this. Had he not done that it's entirely possible he would have been back to his old self sooner. 

* **Was Luke ever stubborn before?**

* I think so and in most cases in the OT it was a strength. His stubbornness made him effectively ignore the advice of his Jedi masters in TESB and convinced him to go it alone. He even tells R2 he wishes he could make him understand why this is what’s needed because he thinks only he sees this solution. He believes it's best for the galaxy long-term.

* **Is a 6 year exile really long?** 

* Not really. Obi-Wan's was 19 years and Yoda's closer to 22 and when Luke is finally exposed to updates on what's going on in the galaxy and outside perspective he does change. He does start to slowly thaw back to how he was prior to the temple incident. For what it's worth, Batman was also in exile for years between the Dark Night and Dark Knight Rises for similar reasons. He wanted the superhero worship to end and for the public to take Gotham back.

* **Did Luke want to come back even before Yoda visited him?**

* Yes. Watching the Blu-Ray again after he connects to the Force for the first time in years and to Leia you can literally see him have that same pep in his step that he had in ANH when he's running out over those dunes. He's shouting ""Rey"" because he's realized it is time to leave. He's beginning to trust again. He's decided perhaps the Jedi can be salvaged. This was implied in the film (Why else would he be happily yelling Rey to her and running in the middle of the night?) and was later confirmed in the extended edition of the novel. Luke was back here and then. 

* **What set him back again?**

* Seeing Ben Solo corrupt yet another of his students set him back to square one. It was a punch in the gut. He'd began trusting Rey and his ability to help and what comes next? The exact same thing as before. The cycle indeed continues and that reinvigorates him to do what he hadn't previously been able to do which was end the Jedi Order. 

* **Why not just try to fix the Order?**

* This is a common complaint I've read and I understand the notion but I think people lose sight of the role the original Jedi Texts play in such a goal. They represent the possibility for fundamentalism in the future regardless of what he tried to setup differently himself. When you’re the only keeper of the equivalent of the only Quran in the galaxy and you've observed and researched issues that seem related to literal interpretations of what’s written in that galaxy’s Quran, and your entire family has been impacted by religious wars and extremism, then the thought might cross your mind about how nothing new can really come while this ancient book is around that will always potentially override any updated take on how to best use the Light by anyone who takes a fundamentalist perspective on it. In a deleted scene with the Caretakers Luke directly tells Rey that the ancient texts don't support what she wants to do and that the galaxy needs Light Side users who don't ascribe to Jedi philosophy. 

* **But isn't book burning a horrible thing?** 

* Yes. And Luke never can bring himself to do it. There's that conflict again. He's stuck between do and do not and needs some outside perspective to work through it again. 

* **Why didn't Yoda come sooner?** 

* He couldn't because Luke disconnected from the Force entirely. Yoda appears within about 30 minutes it seems of Luke reconnecting to the Force again. 

* **But didn't Yoda burn the Jedi texts?** 

* No. Rey takes them before hand and Yoda's line ""That library contains nothing that the girl Rey doesn't already have"" can be taken literally. Yoda released energy in the cloud to burn an already dead tree and start new life. You can see them on the Falcon at the end of the movie.

* **So, why did Yoda burn the dead tree, then?** 

* He could see Luke was stuck between Do or Do not and had created his own purgatory where he wasn't moving forward in any way. The burden of being the keeper of those first texts was a block that was keeping Luke from dealing with the real issues inside. 

* **What does Yoda mean when he talks about how Luke always thinks about the Horizon?** Luke has a tendency to day dream about fixing big grandiose problems instead of working on the smaller issues impacting him inside. He does so again here.

* **Has Luke ever blindly put his faith in a controversial idea before and just hoped for the best?**

* Yes. In Empire he retreats to a metal island and can see no solution. He places his faith in the Force to find a solution and jumps off the ledge falling hundreds of feet. It could have been seen as suicide. However we justify his actions there gives a glimpse into his mindset on Ahch-To. In some ways, Ahch-To is this moment playing out in slow motion.

* **Where does this notion of staying away to help come from?**

* This tough love approach to balance is right out of the canon book the Legends of Luke Skywalker. Luke learned this from the Lew’el where he also learned to spearfish. It's also not new to incredibly powered beings. In fact, it's an approach Tolkien viewed for Istari and Middle Earth. Tolkien believed that Istari had discovered, from their previous interventions, that they didn't work. That their presence would never lead to lasting peace because the beings of Middle Earth needed to move beyond Wizard worship and take control of Middle Earth and build their own peaceful existence. Johnson’s referenced hero worship before. When Batman went into exile between the events of the Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises for years his mindset was similar as well. He wanted the public to take Gotham back and to end the superhero worship. Gandalf, Batman and Luke all ultimately realize this is wrong and ultimately intervene when the stakes are raised and laid out on the table for them to clearly see. These aren’t new concepts from powerful beings seeking to find longer lasting solutions to cycles of violence observed and wondering what might be best for their worlds long-term. 

* **Why didn't Luke just immediately go kill Ben Solo?**

* He doesn't want to kill family. He regrets thinking about it. He also doesn't know where he went immediately afterward.

* **What about the First Order? Why didn't he go stop all of them?** 

* Unlike Obi-Wan and Yoda, who saw the Empire first hand and rising, we aren't given any indication that Luke had any idea of the military might of the FO that was rising. He knew only of Snoke as another Force user who'd obviously communicated with Ben Solo.

* **How long does it take for him to get updates on what's going on and want to come back?**

* Judging by the the initial desire to come back following his connection with Rey... less than a day. 

* **Why didn't he use his X-Wing to get to Crait?** 

* It had been submerged for years in salt water and pieces of it were used in the construction of his hut.

**REGARDING THE BENEFIT TO THE STAR WARS FATHER AND SON STORY AFTER LUKE'S ARC**

* The father and son story of Anakin and Luke is modern myth. It's the greatest modern story about nature versus nurture that we have and about how it's never to late to change course, make amends, and have faith. These were themes that were deeply personal to George Lucas. To have an end of life arc where some of these same important themes that were so important to George Lucas are being explored around the son, in ways more unique to him, and which highlight where the father and son were similar but also different feels like an important bookend to this universal father and story that explores issues of control, post trauma stress, shutting down from people who care about you in times of crisis, crisis of faith, guilt and regret, that it's never too late to change, and that nobody is ever really gone. They just haven't found the motivation to find the Light yet and that motivation is different for each person. For Anakin it was Luke. For Ben Solo it may be the realization that Rey matters more to him than a throne with no one to share it with. Every journey back is unique and it's up to the individual to find some light to guide them back.  

* By eventually listening, Luke realized his makes, realized it wasn't too late to change or to help, realized that the failure of the Jedi are more the failure of individuals within the Jedi than the Order itself, realized that he and Leia had never taught their father's failure to others and that by not doing so history was repeating, realized that flaws and all the Jedi religion is a better guiding set of principles with more wisdom than any other alternative set to oppose the Dark, remembered his father's atonement and achieved the same by apologizing to his sister and Ben, inspired the galaxy, and took away Ben Solo's revenge, which would have only set him further along the Dark Side path anyway. And all of this change and power came from within his mind because...

* Luminous beings are we. Not this crude matter.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Multiple Viewings Required,"I first saw The Last Jedi on opening night hyped and ready to go only to find myself leaving the theatre feeling lost and conflicted. What had just happened? What did I just watch? All the big moments in the film fell flat for me and while stuff happened in the film, it also seemed as if nothing happened.

The second time I saw the film I found that I enjoyed it more without the weight of my expectations crashing down upon my shoulders. Also it was at a much nicer theatre with far better seats than before.

But then time went on and the more I thought about the film the further it slipped closer and closer to becoming one of my least favorite Star Wars films. The negatives were dragging it down for me.

But then (months later) I bought the Blu-Ray and watched the film twice (once directly after The Force Awakens) and I have to admit I thoroughly enjoyed it!  What were once flaws that held the film back for me have now become things that I kind of just accept. I still acknowledge them as flaws, though.

Holdo's secret plan and Rose's motivations at the end of the film when she nearly kills Finn herself still bother me. And the character of DJ can be distracting to me at times only because when I see him I see Benicio del Toro - not DJ. But in the grand scheme of things, there's so much to this film to enjoy!

The acting is the best this franchise has ever seen and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous! And I also quite like the humor in the film. With the exception of the shirtless Kylo Ren scene, I feel the humor is balanced well. More so than in The Force Awakens where the humor (and cinematography) could really bother me at times. The pacing is also a breath of fresh air when compared to the rushed feel of The Force Awakens.

Side note: I really do love The Force Awakens despite what I've said about my issues with it.

I also love the character of Kylo Ren and I can't wait to see where he goes as a character in Episode IX. Adam Driver was so damn good in The Last Jedi! And unlike a fair bit of fans, I actually really liked the direction Rian took Luke in. It made sense to me and Mark Hamill was fantastic in the role! I'm still not 100% on onboard with Luke dying at the end, but everything leading up to that is great! His death is just one of the few big moments that still kind of falls flat for me. I oddly felt more at peace with Luke being killed by that first blast from the AT-M6 Walker (I think that's what it's called) than him just fading away. In time, I think I might appreciate it more, though. It'll all likely depend on how Luke is utilized in Episode IX (if he's in it).

But aside from some minor nitpicks (some hit and miss CGI and the way flashbacks were implemented in a Star Wars film), I have to say I *might* love this film now. Even the soundtrack has grown on me over time!

I could go on and on about each individual aspect of this film, but I won't.

Whether you end up loving it, hating it, or falling somewhere in between I feel as if Star Wars: The Last Jedi deserves multiple viewings to truly be appreciated or not. It's just that type of film.",StarWars,True,1522857584,2018-04-04

"If the Sequel Trilogy had come first, would people be as upset about Luke?","I was thinking this morning about the parallels between Luke in Episode 8 and Yoda in Episode 5.  When we first met Yoda, he was a crotchety old bugger who made bad jokes and refused to train a new student.  He had sent himself into exile and chose to live the life of a secluded hermit.  

Then, the Prequels came out.  Yoda was presented as a leader and a warrior and as someone who cared deeply about the fate of the galaxy.  We adapted our thoughts of him, liking both versions.

This all is very similar to Luke's journey, with the exception that we first got to know the young and idealistic Luke before getting to know the old grumpy dude.  The bad jokes, the self doubt and loathing, the refusal to train a new student...we've seen it all before.

So, tl;dr, I think that Rian Johnson has mimicked Yoda's journey in Luke's story in _The Last Jedi_, but we have reacted to that archetype very differently because of the order we viewed it.

"What would a ""redeemed"" Ben Solo even look like? The galaxy can't be expected to just forgive him, and him dying would be a rehash of Vader.","To me, a straight-up ""redemption"" is not an option for Kylo Ren.  It just goes against his character arc.  This is a guy who consistently CHOOSES to be evil.  And he does so because he wants power.  

Anakin went to the dark side because he thought it would give him the power to actually save his wife.  He was deceived, but he at least had an understandable reason for going down that path.  He was a fallen HERO, so it made sense that he could turn back into being what he was before.  

It's not the same with Ben.  He was always flirting with the dark side (enough to scare Han and Leia).  He wants power for the sake of power.  It's his birthright (in his opinion).  Ben randomly deciding that he wants to be a hero all of a sudden just wouldn't make sense.  He knows that he comes from a family of ""heroes.""  And he thinks they're all weak and stupid.

But I still think SOME SORT of ""redemption"" is possible.  But it's not pure redemption.  It's not Kylo Ren deciding that he wants to be hero now.  Rather, it's Kylo Ren simply acknowledging that he's been going down the wrong path.  It's him realizing that he needs to change.  And it could be as simple as him turning himself over to Rey and the new Jedi for rehabilitation.  Maybe they can help him cleanse his soul of the darkness that has consumed it.  

But it shouldn't go further than that.  Leave that story for another day.  Him realizing that he needs help is a satisfactory conclusion to his arc.  He's been conflicted this whole time.  But now, he can realize that he was wrong to choose evil, and he can begin taking steps towards making a change.

What I don't want is Ben Solo simply riding off into the sunset as a hero.  That wouldn't ring true to his character.  At all.

Another interesting element from that Kylo and Rey Scene,"After the Praetorian guards have been defeated and Kylo speaks to Rey about her parents, he informs Rey that her parents are ""dead in a pauper’s grave in the Jakku desert.""

Was she told by Unkar Plutt years later? Did they ever return? Are her parents also from Jakku?

"""Thrawn: Alliances"" could answer one of the BIGGEST questions about the NEU","So, throughout major Star Wars works in the new canon, there have been recurring references to... something in the Unknown Regions. 

* The Aftermath trilogy is the first major mention of this. It is revealed that Palpatine felt it was a source of the Dark Side itself, felt it was calling to him, and repeatedly attempted to contact it through many ways, including the Jakku observatory. Of course, all of this failed.

* The Thrawn book is our next major reference to this threat. Apparently, the Chiss are worried sick about it and sent Thrawn as a spy to see if the Empire would be capable enough to take it on.

* Until last year, people assumed this to be Snoke. Then Snoke got randomly chopped in half. But then the TLJ novel implies that Snoke is in fact a separate being from the dark force. It also elaborates more about how the force emanates out of the Unknown Regions. Snoke also says that he had rediscovered ""great truths"" about the Force, which may refer to the dark presence or another source of Force power (maybe why he's so powerful?).

Now, based on today's excerpt, Thrawn: Alliances may finally answer the question of what this thing is. The book apparently takes place during the few months between Rebels Season 3 &amp; 4. 

The excerpt takes place just after the Battle of Atollon, where Palpatine is discussing with Vader and Thrawn about the recent events. He then reveals he senses a disturbance in the Force emerging out of the edge of the Unknown Regions, and sends Vader and Thrawn to deal with it. But what's unique here is that we finally get exactly where this disturbance is coming from. It's coming from the small planet of... Batuu. Sound familiar?

I wish people would get over their disappointment over TLJ already...,"Getting pretty sick of people saying that TLJ is a disgrace for killing Star Wars. It has been months since the film was released and I cant find a youtube video where the comment section isn't sprawling with people saying that Rian Johnson murdered/bullied/disrespected Luke Skywalker and ruined their childhood for killing him off... I mean yeah there are a lot of flaws with the film. Rose, Canto Bight, the humour, a certain Leia scene to name a few. I wish that Rian Johnson put more time into the execution of these certain ideas but just because I'm let down in a film doesn't give me a right to call someone an ***hole. At the end of the day it's a film, saying that someone ruined your childhood because they portrayed Luke Skywalker in a different approach is plain childish. I honestly feel bad for Mark Hamill, not because his character was 'murdered'. I feel bad because he publicly voiced his concerns about his character and people are taking what he said out of context just so they can moan about the execution of a film... Star Wars is not dead, on the contrary its more alive than ever with all these spin-off films and TV shows in the works. I mean yeah it's kinda lost its novelty by releasing a film every year but honestly I can't wait for certain stories to be explored. I'm looking forward to seeing what Game of Thrones' D&amp;D come up with and I hope to see a darker Star Wars story.

I get why a lot of people didn't like TLJ, it took Star Wars in a bold new direction and that was always going to alienate people. If the franchise is going to survive it needs to tread new ground eventually. However, I can't take anyone seriously when they say that their  childhood was ruined because of Rian Johnsons interpretation of Luke Skywalker.

Who exactly was the starkiller base built for?,"Ok hear me out....
For the Death Stars we had Darth sideus and Vader to keep the show running for both 1 and 2. There would have been enough fear, suffering and manipulation to keep people working on it and even speed up the process. There was a large political build up to see why the Death Star happened. 

Now it’s not known how long star killer base took to build, some say 30 years, but its safe to say kylo REN would not have even been born then, let alone in power.  So who exactly ran this project, and where would the funding and incentive come from? Was anyone force sensitive on the dark side between Sideus and Ren that was in charge?

CGI clone troopers are better than practical Stormtroopers.,"One of the main criticisms levied against the prequels is the over reliance of CGI, whereas the original trilogy employed groundbreaking practical effects. While I agree with this in some regards, one area I think CGI is superior is with armored troopers. The way practical armor restrains actors forces them to move in ways that look unnatural for a soldier. I mean all of the Stormtroopers in the sequel trilogy look like they're running with a wedgie. Maybe its counterintuitive, but by animating the clone troopers, I think you allow them to move more believably free of these restraints. ",StarWars,True,1521857517,2018-03-23

What I want for the end of the new trilogy,"I feel like with TLJ accepting that the jedi made awful mistakes and that you need to deal with failure in a productive way, then they need to stick with what Yoda and Luke said and agree that the Jedi are supposed to end.

Yes Rey has the books, but I think she can learn what she can from them and not necessarily adopt the same philosophies.

So whatever happened in the movie, I want Rey to not really start the new order until the very end. Like maybe have some people she's training but nothing official, maybe because the FO is putting too much pressure on them. I would like the implication to be she is not going to train ""jedi"" as we know them, without attachment and such. And again, this is all my opinion. Feel free to weigh in, I just feel like if she starts the jedi order unchanged again then it really undercuts the major themes of TLJ, which I loved. Even the ""save what we love"" thing. The jedi don't love, so they won't be able to help that way. Anyway, I just think it would be cool. The final conversation with her and a student could be something like:

""Are we really going to do it? Are we going to restart the Jedi Order?""

""No. We're going to start something better.""

Kylo as leader of the First Order is the most fascinating SW story telling possibility in ages,"I remember as a kid in the 80s, when all I had was the OT and some of the old Kenner toys, wishing that Luke had taken Vader's offer and joined him. I imagined them killing the emperor together and ruling the galaxy pretty well, actually, even if that was not a realistic hope. But now we'll almost get to see that, with Kylo as Supreme Leader. What does he want to accomplish? What kind of leader will he be? There are so many creative possibilities - he might be another monster, or somewhat incompetent, or what I think is the most intriguing possibility, try to be a really good and fair leader. As amazing as Adam Driver has been so far, I think it could be even more amazing to see glimpses of the character trying to be decent, even as he frequently loses control in his rages. As interested as I am in Snoke's story, I think this opportunity is far more interesting than another final showdown with the frail but powerful evil leader.",StarWars,True,1521863962,2018-03-23

Rey has lots of resources to learn about the force, the sith, the jedi and the whole galaxy. She has friends like Leia and Maz for political and galactic knowledge, artoo and threepio to talk to about the previous temples and their ways, and the texts for knowledge about origins. So the ghosts don't really mean a thing for Rey.

Can anyone explain the Resistance cruiser's actions in the opening battle of TLJ?,"First of all I just want to point out that I love TLJ even though it definitely has its weak moments. This is not intended to be a discussion about TLJ's faults or what you didn't like about the movie. One particular thing stands out to me though, but I think it might make sense to someone with the right information.  

So Poe distracts Hux long enough for all the Resistance transports to get away, then he disarms the Dreadnaught's guns to make way for the bomber approach. It's unclear whether or not Leia was unaware of the bomber plan, or if she just wanted to bail on it once everyone was safe, but that's not what I'm wondering about.  

There is a lot of drama and suspense about whether or not Leia and the cruiser will escape once Canady orders the Dreadnaught to destroy them. There's even a shot of Leia looking solemn and resigned to her fate as the canon is about to fire. What I don't understand is why Leia and the cruiser didn't just jump to light speed then and there. One possible explanation is that all the bombers, X-Wings, and A-Wings didn't know where they were jumping to. It's believable that they wouldn't have a detailed evacuation plan because they were evacuating by emergency, but I don't know if the bombers and fighters would be capable of communicating with the cruiser once it jumps away. I understand that Leia would not want them to be separated and unable to regroup.  


Even with that in mind, though, Leia and the cruiser still should have jumped to lightspeed and risked separation from the fighters rather than just dying for no reason. The shot of the fighters and Poe rushing into the hangar bay just as the cruiser jumps to lightspeed suggests that they couldn't or wouldn't leave without them, but it still makes no sense that they would die before leaving them.  


The only rationale I can think of for Leia's actions is the assumption that the cruiser was prepared to jump to lightspeed if they absolutely had to, but didn't go through with it because the Dreadnaught was destroyed. I think this is a bit of a stretch though, considering the shot of Leia accepting her fate. I would also really like to know if Leia was aware of Poe's bomber plan or not. It seems unlikely she wasn't, so why did she want to bail on it?",StarWars,True,1521914459,2018-03-24
Reasons for Finn surviving Episode 8,"I have been giving it thought and I think I know why Disney decided that Rose would stop Finn from following through on his kamikaze.
I have done some research on some articles that will explain my point a little more and why I believe Finn or Rose did not die.

1. Kathleen Kennedy confirming both Rey and Finn would survive Episode 9 before Episode 8 was in cinemas
Source - https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-kathleen-kennedy-teases-more-rey-finn-al-post-2019-1054438
This article was published 35 days before The Last Jedi was available in cinemas to the public so for anyone who saw the article beforehand was basically spoiled to the fate of Finn.

2. Finn couldn't have stopped the laser from firing regardless of Rose's interference 
http://www.slashfilm.com/filmcast-ep-451-an-evening-with-rian-johnson-director-of-star-wars-the-last-jedi/
In this podcast which has the director, Rian Jonshon himself was featured on. Rian Johnson himself said that if Finn could've followed through on his sacrifice it would've been as effective as a ""mosquito going into a bug zapper"". Although this was likely just an excuse for the main reason, money.

3.As Harrison Ford said when George turned down his idea to have Han Solo be killed off “George didn’t think there was any future in dead Han toys.”
This sentence can still apply to Finn, to maximize profits they could keep Finn alive they could make some excuse up for him to live in Episode 8 and keep him alive so they could still sell more Finn toys and that would mean more money.

I understand that some think that they could've made his sacrifice work by making it possible for the speeder being able to stop the cannon but do you think that Disney would pick a different story over money?",StarWars,True,1521916680,2018-03-24

How much did the Lars spend on Luke?,"We've all been there. One day an estranged slave with anger issues and a lightsaber comes back broodily with your very recent but much beloved step-mom's corpse, another, a crazy older wizard comes by with what he says is that guy's baby son and your nephew, won't you please take care of it while I go live down the road and never stop watching you? 

Well... alright, maybe they are pretty darn special in that regard, I guess, and I digress. Attempt at a humorous lead in aside, it is an actual question I've been turning over for years in my head now. (They said yes, clearly).

How much did the Lars' spend on Luke? 

Although he decidedly dislikes the life of a moisture farmer, he doesn't seem to be lacking for options to pique his interest. A personal landspeeder, a T-16, what he himself calls more than enough droids during the conversation about hiring hands to forestall his Academy wishes. The Jawas take the route through their place routinely enough he knows what to remind Uncle Owen to look for, has flight training in his vehicles, the likes. 

The speeder itself was some 2,400 credits at purchase and something less as sale, the initial offer being 1,500 before mind tricks to pay the 2,000 credit down payment on Han's services. Han's price of 10,000 was considered almost enough to buy a personal starship, and Obi-wan's offered 17 k on completion was enough to risk 'Imperial entanglements' for a trip to the core worlds. 

1/5 or so of a interstellar craft in one investment, albeit a practical one, when it didn't need fueling or Luke wasn't running around for power converters. 

Luke's education apparently also extends pretty decently into academia as well as practical functions, given that he and Owen both assume the Empire will *take* his application. The ASVAB isn't exactly a no-brainer in real one-planet Earth, and this is an interstellar military expected to be comprehensively capable at a variety of tasks, all movie jokes and memes aside. Granted, the Empire took conscripts as well, and some of their training grounds had lethal exercises in some variants of the stormtrooper program depending on who you read and how canon you take it, but the pilot corps- what Luke was hoping for- is a different critter. 

We don't follow much of Luke's life on Tatooine. The whole point is largely that not much happens and he wants to leave now that his friends have grown up and started moving. Some glimpses have given us a fairly sporty childhood racing the local kids and shooting wildlife, or adorable little takes like Beru watching a force-sensitive toddler push a ball around, but by and large we don't really take it as a **bad** life at all so much as one he's bored of. Definitely better than it was in Owen's own youth with Craig and the Sand People, although that may, despite Owen's personal feelings, also rest somewhat on the crazy old wizard. 

It's pretty reasonably clear that despite very little reason to, they tried loving, raising, and protecting him the best they could; especially for several states bereaved farmers whose connection was largely through relative strangers; but how much do you suppose they paid to try making his life comfortable *on Jabba's Tatooine*?

However, there's nothing to suggest that Cobalt Squadron or Blue Squadron were under his general command during the battle.  And I'm pretty sure that Cobalt was attacked to the Ninka- which would place them under Holdo's command, (with Cobalt Leader under her but over the CS- though depending on the order of battle, Poe might've been over CL).  Hell, Ackbar was a few feet from Leia, would absolutely have been able to order every squadron back.

The movie puts this as a spat between Leia and Poe, but there is a whole issue with every other commander who didn't order the bombers and other strike craft back- Poe might've disobeyed the order, but so did everyone else in the command chain...

"In your opinion, what is the most powerful Force power?","What do you think is the most powerful Force power?

In my opinion, many of the powers that have been shown in the movies and books are cool, but they are not really that powerful in the end. Lightsaber abilities, telekinesis, Force lightning, etc. are all things that can easily be replicated by technology.

I think the biggest one is the ability to predict the future to a limited extent by (I guess?) seeing different possibilities. If I remember right, it's what enabled Palpatine's machinations that eventually led him to take over the galaxy. 

You could argue that mind control is another very powerful ability, but it seems to be somewhat limited, and certain races and strong-willed individuals are immune or resistant to it...

Disney has clarified that the updated posters for SOLO without guns are only for marketing in Brazil and are not related to politics in the United States,"All I can say is, thank god if they are telling the truth.

""Brazil has had its own recent national debate over firearms, but that’s not even the reason their posters look different. Screen Rant has spoken with Disney about the posters in question and they’ve verified that the posters are specific to Brazil, and they are likely that way because Brazil is trying to push a more family-friendly image for Solo (or “Han Solo” as it’s marketed there) in that region.

Does anyone know of any great Star Wars books?,"I used to have a Darth Vader book (Rise and Fall of Darth Vader by Ryder Windham) &amp; I remember it being really good. Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think there’s anything I can do for the movies part of Star Wars other than watch the cartoon Clone Wars series or rewatch the main movies. So I want to get into books. 

I think I’m looking for a book (or several SW books) that coincides with the movies really well &amp; just further dives really deep into the Star Wars universe in general. If there are any ones that specifically dive deeper into a character’s storyline like the Darth Vader book I had, then that would be great. The movies are great &amp; I generally like all of them &amp; I’m not sure what to expect from any books. 

If you could recommend any SW books that you have enjoyed then please tell me. I don’t know much about canon but I think it means you can’t have a pink Darth Vader or something, it has to stay true to the Star Wars universe &amp; series. So I want one that’s canon, probably follows a storyline of a character I know, &amp; also is HIGHLY RATED &amp; POPULAR among people. I want it to be really good so I can really enjoy it.

I’ve never been a comic guy but I may as well check those out as well. Not sure what else there is. I play Star Wars Battlefront 2 almost on a daily basis &amp; want more out of Star Wars in general.

Edit: I made an edit up top stating the name of the Vader book I read a long time ago. I’m only 21 by the way so I was pretty young when I read it. I don’t want ones that are too different from the movies. I saw there are things called novelizations, are those good? That sounds like it might be up my alley.

The New Republic in the Sequel Trilogy.,"Right, so as someone who is 50/50 in the Last Jedi, but loved most of The Force Awakens. There is one ever-present aspect of the sequel trilogy, that feels like a huge waste. In 2015, the question on the top of my mind was; 'what is the new republic like?'. I was keen on seeing new creatively designed troopers, fleets, blasters and planets. Instead, it felt as if the New Republic never even existed. Instead the Resistance was there, which was (imo) uninspired and boring. We have around 3mins of the New Republic, which focuses on their destruction.

Furthermore, it seems as if they're completely destroyed in the Last Jedi; and yes, I'm well aware that the New Republic demilitarised. Factions have always been so important to the Star Wars franchise, I feel as if the Resistance was the wrong move to make.

What I want to see regarding the Galaxy's state in Episode IX (SPOILERS),"So in TFA, we had a galactic government being decapitated due to putting all of their eggs in one basket. In TLJ, we get the implication that the rest of the Galaxy is not sympathetic enough to the Resistance to send reinforcements immediately to them when the FO is hunting them down.

I want this to be explored in more detail in 9. I want a character from outside of the FO/Resistance to sit down with Rey/Finn/Poe and explain to them a simple fact:

We don't want you any more.

The rest of the Galaxy is tired of this never-ending cycle of Sith vs Jedi proxy wars. They just had 30 years of peace ruined because of one teenage force sensitive Jedi and now they have yet another Evil Empire showing up on their doorstep ready to enslave them all over again. The Republic was next to useless in protecting them and is now once again, destroyed. As far as the rest of the Galaxy is concerned, they don't want any part of this anymore.
This can explain the lack of assistance in TLJ as well as continue on from DJ's speech about the morality of both sides as well.

I would also like some outline on just how strong the FO actually is. It would actually make sense that they are a micro-nation based in the Unknown regions that ""inherited"", (with help from Snoke) several weapons projects from Imperial R&amp;D (Starkiller Base, the Supremacy) to effectively hold the galaxy hostage. There is something poetic about a small organization (the FO/ the rebel alliance) fighting to restore an old institution  (the Empire/ the Republic) with the difference being their alignment. If 9 starts with the FO extremely weakened due to infighting (Ben vs Hux) and losing a large portion of their fleet, it would make for an interesting story.",StarWars,True,1521979844,2018-03-25

When is the Force in balance?,"The Force in Balance is often understood as the light side and dark side being equally strong like two people of equal strength pulling on a rope.

But since the existence of the a lot of light and dark side users at the same time or even only/mostly dark side users always seems to lead to conflict and war (read: chaos, the opposite of balance), how can that be the Force in *balance*? The Jedi dont wage war when the dark side isn't strong, they actively try to stop wars and conflicts. The Force is generated by life, so it should try to preserve life, right? 

To me, it makes a lot more sense that the Force in balance is the peace that reigns when the light side is stronger. Imagine a taut string as the balance of the Force. The Dark getting stronger causes the string to vibrate while the Light tries to pull the string taut again. The light side slacking, like the Jedi Order did after a thousand years of peace, makes it easier for the string to vibrate and big conflicts like the Clone Wars to happen.

When the dark side becomes as strong as it did with Palpatine and the vibrations of the string causes massive wounds in the Force, like the destruction of planets, the Force tries to help the Light to rebalance the string by spawning strong force sensitives like Anakin (and later Luke and Leia since Anakin didn't really work out initially).

When and how did Luke learn to understand R2-D2 without the use of a transcriber?

He also relies on C-3PO to interpret these sounds.

Then, in The Last Jedi, Luke has his brief scene where he interacts with R2-D2, and while R2 continues to make his familiar sounds, Luke is now able to understand the droid. At what point did this change?

Note that, in The Force Awakens, we also see Rey and Poe being fluent in understanding BB-8. I always found this peculiar earlier because, personally, I never believed that droids' variety of sounds would be considered a language capable of being understood by humans.

But in contrast, the second half seems to be completely barren of new SW content. 

Could Disney/Lucasfilm be saving something big for the second half of 2018? If they are, my guess/hope would be a trailer for Filoni's next show.

Knights of Ren thoughts,"So I was thinking about the Knights of Ren, who they were, how they came to be, that kind if thing. So first off, where did they come from?

We know who they are. They are a ""handful of students"" from Luke's Jedi Order who joined Kylo the night of the Temple's destruction. From the vision in The Force Awakens, we see that there are six of them aside from Kylo. And we know that Luke took Ben and a dozen others to restart the Order. So, a full half of them turned to the Dark Side amd became the Knights of Ren. It also means they only killed six Jedi together, rather than a full order.

Because they were Jedi students, you'd imagine that they would use the Force and have lightsabers (duh). But in the vision, they have an assembly of blaster rifles and pikes. This always struck me as odd, and I do hope we either get a good explanation for it, or have them use lightsabers in IX.

Now let's talk about IX. This is likely the last film in the mainline saga, at least fir a long time, so leaving off using the Knights of Ren would be a terrible idea. So I hope they do have a major presence in the film, although I am also wary of what their inclusion would mean. It would mean that Rey, a solitary Jedi, would be going up against SEVEN Dark Side combatants, which would be a logistical nightmare for a movie.

Idk, what do you guys think about the Knights of Ren?",StarWars,True,1522002545,2018-03-25

"Standing in front of the ruïns of Luke's old Jedi temple, Rey looks into the distance.","Standing in front of the ruïns of Luke's old Jedi temple, Rey looks into the distance. 
The Millenium Falcon is landing to pick her up, in her hand she still holds her staff she had on Jakku, a reminder of her past life. She looks at her hand, mechanical, just like Luke had, and his father before him. She cleanses her hand into a fist, the memories of the pain come back to her, the pain of losing it, and the pain the droids inflicted upon her when she was operated on. 

Then she hears a voice, a voice she has not heard in many years, it is Luke.
She turns around to see not only Luke, but a group of other people, they all wear Jedi robes. 
Except for one, one is standing under a tree, half of him is in the light, the other half is in the dark. 
She reaches out with the Force, looking deep into the man.
Then, she feels it, the past, the horrors, the anger, the pain of this man, this thing. 
She looks to the man again, now seeing a vague outline of his past around him, he was taller, covered in leather and a suit of metal. 
On his chest a panel, on his back a cape, and on his head.
A mask!
This was not a former Jedi master, this was a Sith. 
This, was Darth Vader.

In a shock of fear and panic, she reaches for he lightsaber igniting it and holding it in a defensive position to block anything this Sith Lord will throw at her. 

Then she hears the voice again, Luke, he tells her to calm down. That there is nothing to fear from this man. ""He is no longer Darth Vader, he is Anakin Skywalker once again, my father."" says Luke. 

She asks him how there is still darkness in him? He does not answer, he only looks to another man.
This man is also wearing Jedi robes but is much younger than any of the others standing in front of her.
He has tall brown hear, some grey spots in there too. 
He tells her in the most smooth voice possible that no one ever defeats their dark side, they only learn to live with it, and to not let it control them, but to control it, he tells her. 

She looks back at the old misformed man that was once Vader, he smiles, she calms down. Deactivates her saber and places it to rest. 

The old man talks to her again: ""You have done what we all tried to do, to bring balance to the force. To bring peace, justice, freedom, and security to the galaxy. You have defeated your demons, fought your darkness, and saved the universe. Rey, we thank you for that. Now, we can finally rest, our purpose is complete in this life, and we shall pass to be one with the Force forever and completely.""

The figures start to fade away, she looks in panic to Luke. Who only winks at her: ""See you around kid""
All five of them start to fade more, and more until they are gone. Nothing is left of them except for one thing, a crystal. It is red and shattered and hanging from a necklace. She picks it up and feels the pain inside of it, but also a spark of light, she concentrates and pours a bit of her light into the crystal. 
She looks at it again and sees that it is turning from red to white, white like the salt she saw on Crait.
She hangs it around her neck, it is no longer in pain, just like her it now has peace. 

And while the sun is going down she walks to the Falcon, off to Yavin 4, where the new Republic is located. Hopefully, Finn and Po are there as well. After their mission to clean up the remnants of the First Order, she has not been able to see them. 

As she boards the Falcon she looks back at where the former Jedi stood, 
not noticing the dark figure in the distance.

Fan Theory: Star Wars rebels caused the change between legends and canon timelines,"After rewatching Rebels, I thought it might be cool if the original timeline was the legends one, and Ezra saving Ahsoka changed the timeline to the current canon. For example, originally Thrawn would have destroyed all of the ghost crew, explaining their absence in other events. Ezra got the idea of self-sacrifice from the world between worlds, thus changing the outcome and defeating Thrawn. This causes Thrawn to not enact the events of the Thrawn trilogy, paving the way for the First Order to rise instead.

At first, I thought that hearing Kylo and Jyn Erso and other new characters contradicted this, but Ezra changed the timeline by simply entering the world between worlds. It takes a while before sequel characters start to show up, showing the change in the timeline.

A pitch for a single-player game even EA could love: Vader – Year One,"*I’ve posted this in r/gaming r/StarWars and r/StarWarsBattlefront. Sorry if you have seen this multiple times I’ve just worked on it for a long time and I don’t think I am alone in actually wanting a good Star Wars game – which it seems like we haven’t had in a decade.

Background: I am not a games designer nor do I have the technical skills to be. I love writing and I love video games and Star Wars. Ideally I’d like to be a games journalist, which I’ve freelance in but that’s about it.

So like many of you I am increasingly frustrated at the lack of Star Wars video games in the last 10 years. When we have had three good/great ‪Star Wars‬ movies in the last few years, you’d think we have at least a couple really solid games to match the movies? As much as I enjoyed the original Battlefront (2015) its safe to say it was lacking in certain areas – and Star Wars Battlefront 2 obviously made a big misstep when it came to its online multiplayer. Also like many of you I love single player games, more than multiplayer, and my personal favourites of the more recent years are Batman Arkham City, the Witcher 3 and Assassins Creed Origins. But I love Star Wars so much I yearn for a true current generation experience tailored made for single player.

So I’ve developed my own Idea ‘Vader – Year One’. Obviously a nod to the Batman story of a similar name, I feel there is lots of potential in a game set during the formative years of Vader – where he truly transitions from Anakin into the villain of the original movies. So lets get into my pitch for the game:

(Story&gt;Gameplay&gt;Extra content&gt;monetisation)


Story

If people aren’t aware there have been numerous canon comics that have dealt with he formative years of Vader. In an ideal world where I help make this game I would work with Dave Filoni and Pablo Hidago on finding a space for this narrative and staying true to the character of Vader. Now Filoni is the creator of Star Wars Rebels and worked under George Lucas on The Clone Wars. Watching numerous interviews with him (and the great portrayal of Vader in Rebels) I would really use him to help form the understating of Vader in his first year. What does he feel? How does he view Palpatine? How much does his hate for Obi-Wan now define him? How much does his hate for himself? All have been covered in some form in the new comics but getting his take on the specific time period would be important.

Now Pablo Hidago is the head of Lucasfilm’s story group. He is seen a lot on ‘Rebels Recon’ on the Star Wars YouTube channel answering fan questions about the show. As well as being a treasure trove of knowledge, it’s his actual job to know the whole canon of ‪Star Wars‬ after its reshuffle following Disney buying the franchise. Since many stories have come out about Vader in the last few years that you cant trample on I feel it’s important to know what I can and cannot do with the character. It may seem silly to some but canon is seriously important to Star Wars fans – something you have to respect if you make a game that is in the canon.

So now to the actual narrative – I haven’t worked out the complete specifics but the bones of the story is this: Vader is tasked with hunting down a faction of Jedi who survived Order 66 and are reorganising themselves into a new order. It is down to you to hunt each of them down who are all stationed on a different planets. In between this you will develop you relationship with Palpatine and members of the Empire (Tarkin comes to mind). I am not sure which planets because of canon considerations but would love to see Vader in Jedha, Lothal and Coruscant.

The best way to describe it is the story of the original Assassins Creed, one where you take out numerous targets while advancing your skills and relationship with al-Mualim. Like Altair progression in that game, I feel the narrative should see Vader adjusting to his new body. You will gain upgrades and new moves after each level until you become the badass seen later on. I feel it’s the best way to show his development.

(In terms of voice acting I would love to use the original actors for the film even James Earl Jones. I don’t know if he would be committed to that much work. I would be content for a substitute for Jones while the cast of Rebels and Clone Wars voicing other notable characters like Anakin, Palpatine and Tarkin.)



Gameplay

I feel the combat should be a mixture of For Honor and Arkham City/Shadow of Mordor. Vader is slow so he cant be that agile but he should make up for this with brute force. I want to see limbs being severed and brutal combos with the aim to make you feel like you’re playing that final scene in Rogue one. I feel the combo button mash system of WB’s Arkham and Shadow of Mordor games should provide the foundation, but For Honor should come to play in the duelling system. 

I don’t feel the Arkham style of combat would suit facing an opponent using a staff of a saber. So when you click the right stick its changes to a For Honor style of combat – one all about choosing the right defensive stance and timing you blows. For boss encounters I feel this is the only way to make it satisfying while also conveying the slow, methodical and deliberate nature of Vader’s combat (at times). A hybrid system feels to me like the best way to make the gameplay fun and accessible while maintaining a challenge when you face melee opponents.

In terms of the force – I really love both Force Unleashed 1 and 2’s mechanics. Using the Euphoria physics engine on enemies really helps to make it feel like you manipulating an actual person. It was so satisfying watching Stormtroopers hang onto a ledge or each other as you spun them round using the force. Inside combat I feel their should be a quick force attack and some combos that utilise that power.

In terms of level design I feel something like the Force Unleashed would work well here. Due to Vader’s slow nature a more open-ended design isn’t reality feasible – he’s just too slow. Maybe some levels could be more open ended with the help of a speeder though. Something tightly constructed and replayable, like Max Payne 3, would be ideal for this type of experience. I also think some flying sections could be included, really just piggy backing off the fighter combat created for Battlefront 2 which is already really solid.


Extra Content

So if you got this far you might be wondering – why did he say EA would love this game? Well this comes into the next part of my pitch that will address the extra content that could be monetised in a fairly non-egregious manner. Ideally the game wouldn’t be monetised but that is a bit optimistic as EA probably utilises micro-transactions more than any company in gaming.

So like I’ve stated I am a big fan of Arkham City and I am particularly fond of its challenge mode. This is where you fight enemies for a high score on segments taken from the campaign. I feel it would work really well here. Take the best fights of the campaign but also add in some more from the ‪Star Wars‬ canon and movies. A map inspired by Rey and Kylo Ren’s fight with the Praetorians in The Last Jedi, a level fighting Tusken Raiders from Attack of the Clones, a map defending the Jedi temple from the Clone attack or the Genonosis arena. You get the picture. You can take the best and most iconic parts of Star Wars and replay them for a high score. A leaderboard system will obviously be included.

Now like Arkham City I feel this is an area where you should be able to play as multiple characters complete with their own fighting styles and skins. So maybe with the base game you have : Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, Ashoka Tano, Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan. And you can change their skins: so Luke could have all his film variations, Palpatine could have his prequel style Senator outfit, Obi-Wan could have a Ben skin – and maybe just maybe we could even get a pink Darth Vader!

(I also think something similar to Max Payne 3’s arcade mode could be included – take the best parts of a level and remove the cutscenes. Playing as different characters in story mode scenarios would really addd to the replay value.) 


Monetisation

So here is where the monetisation comes in. What EA and whoever makes it should do is keep adding in new challenge maps, characters and skins that you can purchase straight up – NO LOOTBOXES.

You could even stick to their seasons initiative from ‪Star Wars‬ Battlefront 2. A prequel season with skins for young Obi-Wan while also adding Darth Maul, Mace Windu, Yoda and some other ones. (The guy who is always concerned about Droids and Wookiee’s forget what he’s called ). And of course you could buy skins for them – OT Yoda, Rebels/Clone Wars Maul. For the Sequel films you could have Rey and Kylo Ren (Maybe even Finn with his First Order staff). 

For all these you could add new maps too. You could package them in bulk for a discount price in separate DLC’s or let people just buy the skins, maps and characters individually.

So cool characters with their own move sets, from all ‪Star Wars‬ eras that you can customise while purchasing what you want? Sounds like micro-transactions people would actually buy without feeling cheated and without taken things from the base game.


Multiplayer 

Apart from the leaderboard I think they could have a small competitive mode. 1v1 and 2v2 public duels like for Honor and possible 4v4 private matches. Just would add to the replayability


Conclusion 

So I guess this the TL;DR – A single player action game using mechanics similar to Arkham City and For Honor, A story focusing on the first formative year of Darth Vader, a high replayable arcade and a challenge mode with acceptable DLC and micro-transactions.

Anyway if you made it this far thanks for reading let me know what you think – what would you change/improve? Would you make a game about a different character? (pre-prequel Mace Windu game?) would love to know your thoughts.

Even if you don’t like this idea I just hope we can agree we’d all love a single player Star Wars game to come out in the near future!

[SPOILERS] Better ending to TLJ?,"Hi all! First time poster here! I’ll say this right from the start, I LOVED The Last Jedi. It has to be up there in my top 5 favourite Star Wars films! Rian Johnson nailed it, the special effects were stunning (Holdo’s sacrifice - AWESOME), and as always John Williams’ score was perfect. Granted this might be an unpopular opinion given the backlash and I accept the film wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea! However, a thought occurred to me a few days ago and I just needed to share it with a wider audience to see if anyone else would’ve liked to have seen this as well.

The ending of TLJ was stunning, and Luke’s passing was done really well. That being said, I think the scene where he’s weakly clinging on to life while looking at the sunset on Ach To could’ve been improved with one minor tweak, which is the following:

Luke uses his remaining life energy (after saving the Resistance from Kylo and the First Order) to force project himself onto the same mound of dirt he stands on in A New Hope to stare at the binary sunset of Tattooine one last time, with the Force theme played slightly louder and just more epic than at any other point in the movie.

This would’ve made his passing into the Force even more poetic since that’s where we first get a good look at him as a baby in Revenge of the Sith, it’s where his iconic A New Hope moment occurs, and it would’ve led to him going full circle had he passed into the Force on Tattooine, rather than Ach To.

Let me know what you all think about this change, and of course, may the Force be with you.",StarWars,True,1522025471,2018-03-25

"Explain to me how Canto Bight was ""filler""?","So I hate to be confrontational like this, but I just don't understand why people hated the Canto Blight sub-plot and the character of Rose in The Last Jedi. 


The Canto Bight sequences were without a doubt my favorite scenes in the movie, and Rose was such a great character to me. You could imagine my shock when I realized that so many people disliked her. 


I see a lot of arguments that Finn and Rose's Canto Bight adventure was ""pointless"" and did nothing to serve the main plot. To me, this makes absolutely no sense. Like, what? It absolutely does serve the main plot, did you guys watch the same movie that I did? It served to solidify Finn's role in the Resistance - at the beginning of TLJ, it is clearly evident that Finn's loyalty to the Resistance is still in question - he supports them, but he's more worried about Rey than the Resistance's struggles. By the end of his storyline in TLJ, mostly due to his budding friendship with Rose, it is clear that Finn is now a loyal resistance member (to the point that he is willing to sacrifice his life to save it). 


The movie makes it clear that this change in development is partly due to Rose and him seeing the first order's corruption first hand on CB. Finn's character arc in TLJ is very clear, and CB was essential in solidifying that arc. 


The sequel trilogy has been stated time and time again to in its essence be primarily about the ""next generation"", aka our four leading characters: Rey, Kylo, Finn, and I suppose Poe. The combined arcs of these characters is what constitutes the ""main plot"" of these sequel movies. 


And don't get me started on the rose hate (absolutely ridiculous). 


Yeah, I had some issues with TLJ...but the backlash that Rose and the CB storyline got just makes no sense in my opinion. I'd love to hear some more perspectives on this, so please feel free to challenge me. 

Edit: I thought I made this clear in the title of the post, but I guess I need to rephrase: I have a problem with people that believe that CB was ""filler"" (meaning it served absolutely no significance to the overall story). ",StarWars,True,1522027118,2018-03-25

A guide to each pre-order bonus for The Last Jedi.,"I've looked around reddit and haven't found a definitive guide to the different preorder bonuses for The Last Jedi physical release.  I'll give an overview of each version, a history of preorder bonuses for TFA and Rogue One, and my opinion on which version to get. 

Target
$27.99

Movie: Blu Ray, DVD, Digital

Exclusive Features: 40 page art boklet, different cover (I think its a slip cover), potential ""Meet the Porgs"" featurette

Best Buy
$27.99

Movie: Blu Ray, DVD, Digital

Exclusive: Steelbook

4K steelbook version for $34.99.

Disney Store
$24.99

Movie: Blu Ray, DVD, Digital

Exclusive: 4 official Disney lithographs of Chewie/Porg, Rey, Kylo, and Finn vs Phasma.

Wa-mart
NOTE: no official pre-order link.  Only news.
Cost unknown

Movie: Blu Ray, DVD, Digital

Exclusive: Packaging with 6 different covers.

Those 4 versions are the main exclusives I can find.  You're guaranteed the exclusives with a preorder, but you may be able to get them in store while supplies last.  Official release date on March 27th.

Before I give my opinion on each, I want to talk about what each retailer offered for TFA and Rogue One.  

For TFA, Target offered an exclusive featurette (can be found on youtube now) and packaging (ended up being a cheap cardboard slip).  Walmart offered a BB-8 slip cover a collectible pog.  Best Buy did a Steel book and Disney did lithographs again.  The target version ended up disappointing most buyers.  I ended up getting the Disney version and love the lithographs.  Steelbooks are cool if you have them all and Walmarts exclusives seemed kind of cheap.

For Rogue One, Best Buy again did a steelbook, Disney again did lithographs, and Walmart again did an exclusive slip cover (K-2SO this time).  Target changed their tactics and released exclusive packaging with interchangable faceplates of all members of Rogue One.  The Target version is very similar to what Wal-Mart seems to be doing for The Last Jedi.  I wasn't too interested in the version and got the Disney Lithographs again, but the Target version ended up looking really cool! In fact, the Target Version is now selling on eBay for $40-$50!  The Lithographs on the other hand are selling for relatively cheap prices, about $10 per set on eBay.  

Tieing this all into The Last Jedi, I'm torn between the Walmart and the Disney Store version.  I've gotten all Lithographs to date, and they're pretty cool (though they don't hold any high value).  Though the lithographs for the Last Jedi aren't well picked imo.  Kylo with his helmet? He ditched that thing.  Rey's back? ok... Chewie and.... a Porg? I'd rather Poe or Leia OR LUKE.  Seeing how sought after the Rogue One interchangable covers are, I'm tempted to go for Wal-Mart instead.  I might pre-order from Disney to get the Lithographs, then exchange that sealed version at walmart for their cover...  Target's booklet doesn't seem worth it and their ""Meet the Porgs"" will probably be on Youtube.  If I had other steelbooks, I'd continue my set with Best Buy, but I have none.

Thoughts About Luke Throwing His Lightsaber,"A part in TLJ many people seem to hate I believe is misunderstood. I’m talking about the part when Luke throws his old lightsaber over his shoulder like it means nothing to him, after Rey hands it to him. At first I found this part quite stupid and almost a sign of disrespect to the OT.  

However, after rewatching the movie, I believe it’s more Luke showing his remorse for the Jedi way and his disrespect for Rey. He sees a stranger handing him an old relic that means nothing to him anymore, and the stranger means even less (at the time).

Basically what I’m saying is this scene wasn’t just a poorly used moment for a petty laugh, but a moment to show how much Luke resented the Jedi order. 

I may be thinking too much or too little about this scene, or possibly bringing up a point that’s already been stated. I’m just mentioning something I haven’t heard mentioned already.

[Edit]I made this post as I was rewatching TLJ. I just wanted to give my two cents and see what everyone else think. I appreciate all the comments and different opinions. Star Wars bring tons of different ideas and emotions. That’s what makes the fan base so awesome!

Keep ‘em coming!",StarWars,True,1522031277,2018-03-25
"Watching the recently released ""Score Only"" version of The Last Jedi makes me appreciate John Williams' score so much more.","I though the score for The Force Awakens was excellent, but for some reason The Last Jedi's score was lacking for me the first few times I watched it. It seemed like nothing stood out except for [""The Force Theme""](https://youtu.be/W1937VEYguI?t=30s), which seemed to pop up every five minutes just to squeeze some more emotion into a scene. 

However, upon watching some of the TLJ Score Only version, it's clear that John Williams is still at the top of his game. For every emotional beat/moment in the movie, there is a perfect musical theme or hit to match it. You can tell exactly what's happening, exactly what the characters are feeling, even with no dialogue or sound effects. It adds so much to the drama. And the big themes like ""The Force Theme,"" ""Rey's Theme"" and ""Kylo's Theme"" just sound monumental whenever big moments are happening. It reminds me so much of the Original Trilogy's scores, and absolutely holds up in comparison to the first six movies. 

If you haven't already, I'd highly recommend finding a way to watch the Score Only version (especially if you've been disappointed with the Sequel Trilogy's scores so far).",StarWars,True,1522031363,2018-03-25

[SPOILERS for Rebels series finale] Disquisition about a character’s performance and its implication for the central tragedy of Star Wars [x-post from /r/starwarsrebels],"
&amp;nbsp;

Hi /r/starwars! If you are not caught up with Rebels/Clone Wars, I’d recommend turning back now. (Unless of course you don’t care about spoilers.) Anyway, I wrote a lengthy essay and posted it in the Rebels and Maw Installation subreddits. Based on comments from others who read through it all, some people appreciated exploring certain aspects of the mythos in this manner. I thought it might be nice then to share here (slightly edited) for those who don’t visit the other subs. Then if you'd like to, we can discuss! As always, thanks for your time. :)

&amp;nbsp;

It’s important to remember Ezra was already aware of who the Emperor was. Ezra had a very clear idea of just how much he had lost at the hands of this monster. He even made sure to say so. Ezra was rightfully indignant and suspicious when they met, and **STILL** he felt the pull of the Emperor. He wavered, but buoyed by his unshakeable faith in his friends, he made his definitive rejection of the dark side. No matter how painful it was to lose his parents all over again, Ezra answered the call to the light because the Emperor had failed to cut him off from his support system. Anakin had no such benefit. As a nine year old, he had no reason to doubt Palpatine and every reason to trust him. By the time he was 23, Anakin was slowly isolated away from every avenue of help until it was too late. Now thanks to Rebels, we can gain some new insight into the machinations behind the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker.

&amp;nbsp;

Within the context of canon, Anakin’s destiny was sealed long before that fateful encounter in the Chancellor’s suite. The limited series *Obi-Wan &amp; Anakin* highlighted one such small but key moment for toppling the Republic. In the comic, Palpatine took tween Anakin into the black underbelly of Coruscanti society. Palpatine framed their sojourn as a simple mission of righteousness but made Anakin witness societal ills, and in typical demagogue fashion, he painted himself as the only salvation for the downtrodden. He goes so far as to intentionally trigger Anakin’s hang-ups over his enslavement in order to insinuate the Galactic Senate is too corrupt and the Jedi too ineffectual for saving those left to rot in crime and squalor (i.e. the very people Anakin longed to one day liberate himself). The first seeds of doubt were sown, and the future Emperor succeeded in undermining Anakin’s faith in what the Jedi stand for. Throughout all of this, Palpatine lavishes praise on Anakin’s abilities (inflating his sense of self-importance that Obi-Wan was trying so hard to temper) while constantly using terms of endearment and familiarity. At one point he even calls Anakin his son in a seemingly throwaway comment, likely knowing how such simple words could prey on Anakin’s desire for a father figure. Trust me, for skilled manipulators, nothing is as critical as making sure every word your victim hears from you is as targeted as possible. It pays off, because by the story’s end, Palpatine has tricked tween Anakin into committing an unethical act in the name of the “greater good.” They part with Palpatine telling Anakin that no matter how the Jedi may treat him, there will always be a place for him at Palpatine’s side. The way the comic is drawn and how the dialogue is written is suitably unsettling for what it is effectively portraying: the Star Wars equivalent of a child molester grooming a kid. 

&amp;nbsp;

It’s one thing to read it, but it’s another to hear it. That’s where Rebels came in with Ian McDiarmid’s finest performance as Palpatine. While voicing Palpatine’s confrontation with Ezra during the series finale, Ian is subtle in a way he has never been before. In the prequels, Chancellor Ian is subdued when he needs to be but is still kind of upbeat. He also clearly delights in opportunities to be bombastic as Sidious Ian. In Rebels it’s the first time he has been… understated, and I can’t stress enough how important that kind of nuance is for what he is attempting to do in that scene. Not to mention how jarring it was to see this version after Episodes 12 and 13 of Season 4, which featured classic, wonderfully hammy Sidious Ian. 

&amp;nbsp;

The importance of being understated as the disguised Palpatine during the finale is how nonthreatening it allows the Emperor to be. There’s a gentle cadence that invites your confidence. He is charismatic enough to sound trustworthy. You start to believe him in spite of knowing what he is. After all, how could this elderly man be some grand malevolent force if he is so polite and patient? His authority feels like compassion. His demands sound like suggestions; his manipulation sounds like wisdom. And that’s where things got kind of dark for me, because there is unfortunate accuracy in talking like that. It works. 

&amp;nbsp;

And because it works, that scene seriously disturbed me. The Sith master was beginning his seduction of a kid woefully under-equipped for understanding the magnitude of the threat before him. In the span of a few minutes, the Emperor showed how he maintained so unyielding a stranglehold on Anakin for decades. Ian’s performance was a masterclass in delicacy without overdoing it. At the beginning of their encounter, Ezra is confrontational but soon starts to fall under the Emperor’s spell, and Palpatine knows it. He does his best to be careful. One misplaced word and he would lose Ezra. And up until Ezra opts to destroy the temple, Palpatine is the definition of unctuous. He starts the encounter by painting his theft of the Jedi temple as a great gift for Ezra, graciously given with no ulterior motives. He then transitions into his greatest hits from his time with Anakin, right down to terms of endearment and the promise of saving ~~Padme~~ his parents. He frames the whole encounter as an example of his magnanimity, when in reality the entire universe was perilously close to falling into his clutches forever. Never once did he say what he really wanted out loud, and he still almost got it. I unfortunately know this kind of behavior works. When Ian whispered so softly, so sweetly, “This is what you want, isn’t it? ... You deserve this…,” I was creeped out to say the least. I can’t stand Palpatine, but in this scene even I could see the appeal he could create for himself with the unprepared. If he behaved this way with young Anakin on a regular basis, what chance did someone so broken by slavery ever have? Anakin didn’t just need support, he wanted it; Palpatine took advantage of that vulnerability.

&amp;nbsp;

Like their namesake, real-life Palpatines keep their true selves hidden and hooded. They aren’t usually opportunistic. First they build a respectable reputation. They choose prey carefully, then establish a rapport and possibly take years to bring a plan to fruition. Sound familiar? In Sidious’ Legends manifesto, *Absolute Power*, published in *Book of Sith*, he walked through the steps for bending specific individuals and the galactic citizenry at large to his will. In many ways it was identical to the strategies of real groomers and Orwellian tyrants alike. It’s incredibly eerie and foreboding. There really is no other word for it than insidious. Because real-life Palpatines take you right up to a line you don’t want to cross, then they whisper lovingly in your ear, and with such promises of acceptance for who you are. They don’t bully you into compliance or drug you into submission. They convince you that you can walk across the line together, hand in hand. Only when it’s too late do you realize they had already dragged you across by your hair. But in spite of any shame and guilt, if you’ve been groomed well enough you start to wonder if you had wanted to cross that line all along. Maybe it was your decision. Maybe you meant for it to happen. And then that guilt starts to twist into hate. Hatred of yourself. As long as you continue to blame yourself, you’ll never want for a source of anger. In other words, just the kind of self-perpetuating anger in which you’d want a budding Sith apprentice to lose himself.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Now current canon hasn’t been around long enough to get as explicitly into Anakin’s grooming as Legends used to. The sentiment from one piece of Legends continues to be the gold standard by which to measure this aspect of Anakin and Palpatine’s relationship. The efficacy of Palpatine’s temptation is told best in the brilliant Episode 3 novelization by Matthew Stover. Throughout the novel, Palpatine is constantly slipping reminders to Anakin that he and only he accepts him. Any resistance Anakin offers is dismissed more and more deliberately until Palpatine finally reveals himself. Here’s a relevant excerpt:

&amp;nbsp;

“’I have kept the secrets of your marriage all these years. The slaughter at the Tusken camp, you shared with me. I was there when you executed Count Dooku. And I know where you got the power to defeat him. You see? You have never needed to *pretend* with me, the way you must with your Jedi comrades. Do you understand that you need never hide *anything* from me? That **I accept you exactly as you are**? Share with me the truth. Your absolute truth. Let yourself out, Anakin.’
&amp;nbsp;

[Palpatine proceeds to reveal his true identity, and the point of view switches to Anakin]
&amp;nbsp;

You don’t remember putting away your lightsaber… You don’t remember collapsing in the chair where you now sit, nor do you remember drinking water from the half empty glass that you find in your mechanical hand. You remember only that the last man in the galaxy you still thought you could trust has been lying to you since the day you met.
&amp;nbsp;

And you aren’t even angry about it.
&amp;nbsp;

Only stunned…
&amp;nbsp;

‘If only you could know how I have longed to tell you, Anakin. All these years—since the day we met, my boy. I have watched over you, waiting as you grew in strength and wisdom, biding my time until now, today, when you are finally ready to understand who you truly are.’
&amp;nbsp;

‘I am not...,’ you hear yourself say, ‘…on your side. I am not *evil*.’
&amp;nbsp;

‘Who said anything about evil? I am bringing peace to the galaxy. Is that evil? I am offering you power to save Padme. Is that evil? Have I attacked you? Drugged you? Are you being tortured? My boy, I am *asking you*. I am asking you to *do the right thing*…’”

&amp;nbsp;

What makes this kind of abuser truly contemptible is not just their depravity, but their irresistibility. Just look at Palpatine, who clothed his naked villainy in the holy writ of his victim’s ideals and desires. In doing so, he no longer needed to use physical force to coerce Anakin into relinquishing control. He first made Anakin feel obligated by listing and “cashing in” on all the actions Anakin mistook for friendship. Then he went for the ultimate tool of any manipulator, a Sophie’s Choice: betray everything you hold dear to save Padme, or reject me and condemn your wife to death. He poisoned the well of Anakin’s mind for so long with absolutism that Anakin accepts the Sophie’s choice as the only choice he has. The other side effect of being groomed is when you blame yourself, you think you deserved whatever happened and you begin to call this prison of your own making a home. It’s part of why so many victims of domestic violence stay in abusive relationships. It’s why Vader was resigned to his fate and believed himself to be totally lost. The Stover novel also highlights this regrettable aspect of abuse from Vader’s point of view. After the duel on Mustafar, he realizes he was misled by Palpatine but gives in. Relevant excerpt (Gives me chills every time. Also the shadow it refers to is the Emperor):

&amp;nbsp;

“You rage and scream and reach through the Force to crush the shadow who has destroyed you, but you are so far less now than what you were, you are more than half machine, you are like a painter gone blind, a composer gone deaf, you can remember where the power was but the power you can touch is only a memory, and so with all your world-destroying fury it is only the droids around you that implode, and equipment, and the table on which you are strapped shatters, and in the end, you cannot touch the shadow.
&amp;nbsp;

In the end, you do not even want to.
&amp;nbsp;

In the end, the shadow is all you have left.
&amp;nbsp;

Because the shadow understands you, the shadow forgives you, the shadow gathers you unto itself.
&amp;nbsp;

And within your furnace heart, you burn in your own flame.
&amp;nbsp;

This is how it feels to be Anakin Skywalker.
&amp;nbsp;

Forever.”

&amp;nbsp;

However toxic Palpatine’s acceptance was, it was all Vader knew. Cracking through that many layers of self-hatred and learned helplessness is difficult for anyone, let alone a genocidal space wizard. Ahsoka’s offer during Twilight of the Apprentice, though obviously the healthiest choice for him, was still too tainted by his perception that she abandoned and thus betrayed him. He lashed out. Like many others trapped in abusive relationships, he wasn’t able to break free until he was shown unconditional positive regard in the form of Luke’s love.  

&amp;nbsp;

Ian’s performance inspired me to write about all this for multiple reasons. Prior to the finale the only mirror we really had for Palpatine’s grooming of Anakin was his attempt with Luke. While the broad strokes are similar, Palpatine was openly Sidious in ROTJ. He made no pretense of his desire to reduce Luke to a servant of evil and reveled in Sith sadism. However, with Ezra he made a genuine attempt at repeating his grooming of Anakin. Palpatine made every effort to appear understanding of Ezra’s longing for his parents while he ignored Luke’s. I don’t think that’s a mistake. It tells us something. Given what we know about the lengths the Emperor went to in conquering both Anakin’s soul and the galaxy, we can establish a pattern of behavior.  The more he wants something, the more he relies on subterfuge to get it lest overt action jeopardizes his success. For example, see how he and the Kaminoans schemed to keep Order 66 a secret after ARC trooper Fives discovered the plot. He prefers making sure his goal is accomplished before his target realizes it needed to resist him at all. The lack of effort he put into Luke tells us he didn’t really care one way or the other. While a healthy Skywalker is probably preferable to a handicapped Chosen One, Vader was tolerable. If Vader died, he was unworthy. If Luke died, he was unworthy. Either outcome would be a win in the Emperor’s mind. 

&amp;nbsp;

Not so with Ezra. He was already starting at a disadvantage because of Ezra’s awareness of his true nature. Nevertheless, he pulled out all the stops for Ezra, literally stone by stone. By returning to tried-and-true grooming tactics, he showed us he believed he had more to gain from corrupting Ezra than Luke. It’s easy to see why. Luke offered at most a means of cementing his existing rule. Ezra offered access to the world between worlds. This nobody from Lothal was all that stood between Palpatine and absolute mastery of all time and space. And Palpatine had already heard the deepest, most desperate desire of Ezra’s heart. He knew how to make a perfectly targeted assault on Ezra. He probably saw an easy victory, but just like with Luke, Palpatine demonstrated how glaring of a weakness his overconfidence could be by underestimating Ezra’s love for his new family. As for how quickly he turned on Ezra, I think he wasn’t aware of any other access points so after the temple’s final destruction he had no further reason to keep up the charade. If he knew of other entry points (\*cough\* DAGOBAH AND VROGAS VAS \*cough\*) I suspect he would have taken Ezra prisoner for further corruption attempts. The world between worlds is a big deal, especially for someone like Papa Palpatine obsessed with ruling for eternity. Only time will tell if we learn the Emperor continued his pursuit post-Rebels.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I don’t think I’ve yet accepted Anakin’s fall. Every time I read Stover’s novel or watch ROTS or the Clone Wars, I can’t help but pray things will turn out differently and that maybe, just maybe, this time Anakin can be saved. :( Sure, Anakin was damaged goods, but he had such potential. Not strength with the force, but strength of character. Like Ahsoka said in Rebels, it was surprising just how kind he could be. His desire for justice, his devotion to friends and the helpless, and his respect for life made him a truer Jedi than many of his prequel-era colleagues. If it hadn’t been for the rigidity of the prequel-era Jedi, I’m sure he would have flourished into a fulfilled individual capable of resisting Palpatine’s advances on his own. Heck even with said rigidity, the Emperor knew his plan would fail unless he dismantled Anakin’s support network by cutting off access to Ahsoka, Obi-Wan, and eventually Padme.  

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t want to be a Vader apologist. The atrocities he committed as Vader were his choices. But understanding is essential for preventing recurrence. The cautionary tale of Anakin Skywalker is an opportunity for introspection. And there are some invaluable lessons to learn from his tragedy that we can apply to our lives. Though he was legitimately preyed upon by forces outside of his control, Anakin failed to deal with his issues in a healthy manner and that made him vulnerable to further deterioration. The victim lived long enough to see himself become the villain. So it can be in real life. We may not like to acknowledge it, but it’s all too easy to wind up becoming the Palpatine of someone else’s story, whether that’s by lying or manipulating or something more sinister. It’s easier still to not even notice the damage caused. Many forget or simply ignore that when we deny another human being their agency, we deny them their dignity. For all the fiction and fantasy of Star Wars, Palpatine’s lust for Anakin was a cracked mirror reflecting a harsh reality. Clone Wars and Rebels go even further, showing the Emperor had a long history of predatory behavior toward Force-sensitive individuals, especially children. He made many attempts to steal younglings from their homes and in turn rob them of any chance at a normal life. Whoever was successfully abducted was subjected to a lifetime of torture and brainwashing. Maul was one such victim in that regard; he died never getting to know anything but hate. It’s disheartening that many real lives will be made to know similar pain. Palpatine’s goal may not have been sexual, but he reached into the same toolbox as all the unscrupulous do in the pursuit of their own ends. Story or not, exploitation leaves behind lives in its wake. 

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe I’m taking Star Wars too seriously, but I am a firm believer in the idea that it is the message, not the medium, that holds the meaning of our greatest truths. It’s why countless individuals have been influenced for the better by works of fiction. By thinking about a few minutes of Ian’s performance like this, we can learn to recognize people like Palpatine in our own lives. We can learn to stop people like him before they hurt others, and identify when people victimized by his avatars need our help. And if need be, we can learn to not be him. Star Wars is nothing if not a resounding affirmation of redemption. Its heroes are driven by the power of hope. Maybe someday, we will ensure people like Palpatine exist only in fiction. After all, it’s like Luke told us.

&amp;nbsp;

We have that power, too.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: If you were strong with the Force prior to Endor, you could bet at some point Seducin' Sheev was going to pay you a visit. If you had something too important to risk losing (e.g. the power of the Chosen One or access to the world between worlds), the method by which he'd try to convert you has more in common with child molesters than dictators. He prefers luring his victims rather than forcing them. With as big of a god complex as he has, he probably relishes the feeling of control he gets from making his targets choose their own downfall.

Stakes in the Sequel Trilogy,"As we all know, some people are unhappy with the creative direction that the ST has taken.  They feel like this story has betrayed the OT (some going as far as to say that the ST has ""undone"" the victories of the OT).  I don't necessarily agree with that sentiment, but I can understand it.  

Rather, I feel like the point of the ST is to SECURE the victories of the OT.  That is to say, if the ST heroes don't get the Jedi Order established and prevent the First Order from conquering the galaxy, then the victories of the OT will officially be undone.  With the way things ended in TLJ, it looks like the galaxy is finally ready (at least spiritually) to fight against the First Order.  So it just depends on where JJ takes things from here.

But for those of you who don't like where they've taken the story, what would you have rather seen?  Given the 30 year time-jump, what should the good guys have been fighting for?  And keep in mind that the point of the ST was the wrap up the Skywalker Saga.  ",StarWars,True,1522074311,2018-03-26
Why Rey is so powerful in the Force with little-to-no training.,"I was rewatching *Empire* the other day, and I got to the famous scene where Yoda instructs Luke to lift his sunken X-wing out of the swamp. Luke balks at the idea.

""Master, lifting rocks is one thing but this is totally different!"" he says.

""No! No different!"" says Yoda. ""Only different in your mind!""

Despite this, Luke cannot summon the confidence in himself to lift the ship out of the swamp. When Yoda does it with seemingly little effort, Luke says ""I can't believe it!""

To which Yoda replies ""That is why you fail.""

The power of the Force is centered around belief in oneself. It's not how many years of training you've had that determines your abilities in the Force but your confidence in yourself. I think the years of training padawans went through had more to do with discipline and philosophy than Force abilities.

But, to get back on track, that is why I believe Rey is seemingly so strong in the Force without a lot of training. It's because she has incredible self-confidence. Having been on her own since she was a little girl, she's had no choice but to be confident in herself and her skills to survive a place as rough-and-tumble as Jakku. 

By comparison, Luke had a more sheltered upbringing on Tatooine. Sure, that planet is no picnic either. But Luke had a family that loved him and protected him and sheltered him. The events of *A New Hope* are the first time he ever had to be self-reliant.

"A standard ""redemption arc"" wouldn't feel right for Kylo Ren.","It worked for Darth Vader because he was established as a hero prior to turning to the dark side.  Anakin Skywalker was a brave Jedi who fought in the Clone Wars.  A good-guy-turned-bad.  That's not how they've been building Kylo Ren's character.

He's been established as a kid who flirted with the dark side (enough for it to frighten his parents), and then eventually gave into it.  And now, as someone firmly on the dark side, he continuously CHOOSES evil.  He WANTS to be the baddest mofo in the galaxy.  It's not like Vader, where he fell because he thought he could save his loved ones.  Ben hates his ""loved ones.""  He thinks they're weak and stupid.  He WANTS power for power's sake.  There is no misguided-yet-selfless motive here.

At least at the beginning of TLJ, he still has a conscience (he chooses not to kill his mother).  But by the end of the film, he's ready to burn it all down.  This isn't a person that's on the path to redemption.

The way I see it, there are only two satisfactory conclusions to Ben's story:

1. Retributive Justice (Death)
2. Restorative Justice (Rehab)

Either he has to die, or Rey has to ""take him in"" with the intention of freeing his soul from the darkness that has consumed it.  He can't be just a good guy at the end of this trilogy.  That would make no sense.  At best, he can agree with Rey that he needs help.  But it shouldn't go any further than that.

Pure redemption would be a betrayal of his entire arc.",StarWars,True,1522091179,2018-03-26

What would you have done differently in the sequel trilogy?,"Here’s my ideas

Have the republic be the dominant force in the galaxy, with the imperial remnants being a shadow of their former self but rapidly growing in strength in the uncharted regions and edges of the outer rim, under the new name of the First Order.

The First Order is surprisingly popular, on the surface they appear to be far different than the empire, giving food and supplies to the impoverished planets, and freeing slave worlds that the republic are too busy squabbling amongst themselves to interfere with. but in reality they’ve used it as an excuse to indoctrinate soldiers and extract resources.

Kylo Ren and the knights of Ren are effectively a terrorist group, officially they’re unaffiliated with the First Order but are used by Snoke for his personal missions, they regularly use guerilla tactics to strike terror at the heart of the republic.

After the Jedi temple massacre and Ben’s fall to the dark side, Luke left to search for a way to stop Snoke, who has such strong powers of mental manipulation, Luke feared a direct confrontation would end with himself falling to the dark side too.

The republic, terrified without their biggest line of defence, secretly authorises the construction of Starkiller base. Leia argued against this in the past, and is unaware of it having been built. 

Leia is still a politician, while Han is a general.

Kylo Ren leads a force of first order troops to take over Starkiller base, at which point Grand Admiral Thrawn, the friendly public face of the First Order, broadcasts a message to the galaxy revealing the Republic built this weapon of mass destruction, he also claims the republic was about to use it to wipe out their worlds entirely. Thrawn then orders it to be fired upon the republics capital fleet, this destroys a large part of their fleet (most is still fine though) and wipes out a system of worlds.

Rey is still around, just not super competent at everything. She’s good with a staff and at repairing things, but can’t fly ships or use the force as easily. After finding BB8, she’s attacked by one of the knights of Ren who are searching for the droid, but she’s then saved from the attack by a Jedi Knight, one of Luke’s few surviving pupils (you can even have him be Kyle Katarn or someone.)

For some reason BB8 is willing to show the map to Rey, After the Jedi senses the force in Rey, he brings her along to the military headquarters and agrees to train her in the ways of the force.

First movie ends with The republic military managing to destroy the firing mechanism of Starkiller base so it can’t destroy any more worlds, but the base itself remains intact, effectively giving the First Order a planet sized mobile space station.

Thrawn orders the beginning of the invasion proper, and a huge fleet is seen.

Rey’s Jedi Master is killed by Kylo and his knights of Ren, but not before he leaves Rey with a holocron telling her to find Luke Skywalker.

Snoke would have once been Darth Plagueis, who gave up the ways of The Sith and sees them as being as foolish as the Jedi now. The reason he’s interested in Kylo is because he created Vader and is effectively the guys great grandfather.

I have a few different ideas about what Rey’s origin should’ve been, I’ll post it below. Feel free to ask me any questions about the state of this alternate universe.

"The Last Jedi Novel retcons Leia's training, explains space leia, and sets up lukes order to be like his Legends order.","I'm doing my audiobook reread now and I just got to this great chapter. But first I just want to say that I loved the first chapter with Han's funeral since its the first time in the NEU it feels like they loved one another and were a family. 

Anyways first off in interviews they said leia had no training. And in Bloodline's Leia mentions having no training and laments it because of being attacked. But in here she talked about being trained by luke. Well enough in fact to sense all of the emotions on the ship and pick out specific individuals from the group

""Stretch out with your feelings, Luke had told her...She could feel the Force around her now, and the beings creating it, along with the wild cacophony of their emotions. Leia let it all wash over her, allowing its tides to carry her this way and that. Then she reached out for those individuals with whom she had an emotional connection."" 

So she was actually trained by Luke in how to use the force. 

In Legends Lukes academy allowed adults to be trained, have relationships, use their emotions, etc (all the same things we will see Rey and her Jedi do most likely.) I always loved how he fixed the PT era jedi. And he does the same thing in the NEU.

""Luke had explained, he had rejected the teachings of the Jedi. The Order had forbidden emotional attachments, warning that they left a Jedi vulnerable to the lures of the dark side...But Luke had disagreed with Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi that Anakin was lost to the light. He had insisted that the very emotional entanglements that had led Anakin to become Darth Vader might also draw him back—entanglements such as the stubborn love between a father and son, each of whom had thought the other lost.""

So its good to know that before he decided to hid out on his rock he was at least heading in the right direction. 

&gt;Leia’s eyes closed and she lowered her head, her outstretched hands tensing as she concentrated.
Feel the Force around you. Life creates it, makes it grow.
Leia reached out with her senses. She was surrounded by the remains of battle—but thin traceries of life remained around her, generated by the tiny microorganisms that lived, undetected, on and in bodies and even in the air. Their Force energy was ebbing, dying out or growing dormant, but she could sense that it formed a tenuous ladder back to the warship behind her.
Leia asked the Force to help her ascend that ladder and return to the broken bridge. Where, faintly, she could see Resistance crewers gathered at an air lock.

So now that we know she had training and can sense things it makes more sense for her to be able to pull her self with a force pull back to the ships espically using the last dieing glimmers of the force as a guide. I mean I was ok with it being a near death last resort one in a million move but this is great as well. 

TLDR: Leia did get trained, Lukes Academy was like in legends, and Super Leia makes sense. 

This book is making me like TLJ a lot better.  And yes I know its only quasi canon because something in 9 could overwrite it but let me have this. I mean they still need to bring Luke back permanently in 9 for me to like the ST but i'm at least luke warm with it now. ",StarWars,True,1520984615,2018-03-13

[TLJ &amp; CW Spoilers] Just something I wanted to say,"A lot of people seem to think that hyperspace ramming was introduced in The Last Jedi, and I just wanted to say that's not the case in the current canon. In the Malevolence arc of the 3d-animated Clone Wars series, the titular spaceship Malevolence is destroyed by being hyperspace rammed into a moon. If a ship can be hyperspace rammed into a moon, then it stands to reason that a ship can be hyperspace rammed into another ship.

I personally don't think the Holdo maneuver is a plot hole, as there really haven't been that many Star Wars battles where it would make sense strategically. But if you do think that hyperspace ramming messes up the logic (what little there is) of the Star Wars universe, then technically you should be mad at episode 1 season 4 of The Clone Wars, not TLJ.

Anyhow, the name that caught me was Vasileía.  Which, google translates to Royalty.  Is Leia's name intentional then?

Reading The Last Jedi book really validated why I hated parts of the movie but..,"Made me appreciate the parts that I wanted to like but didnt get enough detail.

For examples of both instances, the beginning scene with Poe talking to Hux in the book was REALLY painful to read. It was entirely cringe that they quoted line for line the dialogue in the movie. It didnt hold up in the movie and personally I thought it was 10x worse in the book.

Luke training Rey is given some good justice and much needed fleshing out.

Still currently reading but I am in the crowd that severely didnt like the movie and hoping the book gives me a more enjoyable opinion because I really want to like the sequels. Cheers all. ",StarWars,True,1520991180,2018-03-13

*SPOILER* Luke is always the one that has to be found. *TLJ SPOILER*,"In A New Hope. Uncle Owen is looking for Luke. Ben Kenobi has to find Luke in the wasteland so he doesn't prematurely die at the hands of Tusken Raiders. Later on, in the death star's garbage chute, the heroes have to look for Luke under the water. 

Then In Empire Strikes Back, the first thing the heroes has to do is look for Luke again because Luke got lost looking for things. Meanwhile, Darth Vader is looking for Luke, loses him in a duel only to find him again outside the carbon chamber. Seconds after that, Leia has to look for Luke using the force. Vader goes back finding Luke immediately afterward with his Star Destroyer. 


In Return of the Jedi, Vader finds Luke a few more times again and again. Finding him at Endor and a few more times in the Emperor's throne room as Luke stayed hidden. 

The Force Awaken revolves around finding Luke once again. It got to a point where in TLJ, even Luke had to find himself before confronting Kylo Ren while saving the Resistance.

What an absolutely FANTASTIC making-of doc,"I’m one of the ones that really loved TLJ and it has gotten better for me with each viewing. But man, oh man I was not prepared for the intensity of that 1:35:00 making-of doc.

This was without a doubt what we should’ve gotten for TFA but alas. I was so enthralled with the ins and outs of making a big budget film like this and I have nothing but mad props for Rian, Ram, Neil Scanlan, Michael Kaplan and the rest of the production crew. I can’t imagine the stress and emotional cost involved in making something like this. The parts focusing on the actors, especially Mark and Carrie’s were really touching. I was so pleased with how candid they were with showing (hell, *highlighting*) Mark’s creative disagreements with Rian. 

Anyway, highly recommend watching it after you watch the movie again from the comfort of your couch. Interested to hear others’ thoughts. 

EDIT: Now that I’ve had a little longer to think on it, there was *one* noticeable absence in the doc and that was anyone from Story Group. I really try not to jump to conclusions but it does kind of reinforce to me the notion that the saga films are things the SG sort of take a backseat on, which is a little unsettling to me but I’m not going to panic over it.

Episode IX Title Guess: A Spark of Hope,"This is purely speculation and open to judgement (which everyone here is good at- and I mean that as a compliment). But hear me out: 
Episode 3 and 6 both have Jedi in the title, so it’s okay if 4 and 9 have Hope in the title. (Plus, 4 technically didn’t have Hope in the title until much later). 
In addition, The Last Jedi was placed in Ep. 7’s crawl and repeated by Snoke in the film. Similarly, A Spark of Hope is in the crawl and repeated by a few characters in the film.  The ending of 8 also alluded to more sparks of hope throughout the galaxy. 
If I’m wrong, it’s only a few downvotes and it will be lost to Reddit oblivion. If I’m correct, it will make me happy and it still won’t impress my wife and daughter. Anyway, that’s my guess.  Cheers! ",StarWars,True,1521001628,2018-03-14
Weaponized Hyperspace - What consequences would make it unused historically?,"In The Last Jedi, a big point of contention has been why we no one has weaponized it before.  The first thing that came to my mind was that it should destroy the hyperspace for lightyears around.

Causing a massive tear in hyperspace, the surrounding region should essentially be too unstable to maintain hyperspace jumps.  One isolated incident over an unpopulated world wouldn't be too bad, but using it in a massive war near trade routes would make it unthinkable.  Destroying the ability to travel between systems would collapse galactic civilization for thousands of years as they adjust &amp; find a new greater than lightspeed method of traveling.

This is kind of ruined by the Falcon traveling away, but perhaps the tear starts small in the vector of the destruction, but then causes a ripple outward distablizing hyperspace outwards.",StarWars,True,1521002673,2018-03-14
The point of Canto Bight is that it is pointless,"One of the biggest criticisms of The Last Jedi I have noticed is Canto Bight. Usually it's ""why did they even go there it was pointless because they got caught and betrayed by the person they found"".

Well the over-arching theme of The Last Jedi is failure. They thought if they went to Canto Bight they'd get the code hacker, sneak onto Snoke's ship, and save the day. But that's not what happened. They failed. Just like in real life, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.

I feel like people are misinterpreting the series as being some noble-bright fantasy setting. Maybe this is because of Star Wars Rebels, I dunno. Has anyone making the criticism even watched the OT and PT? The prequels ended with evil winning because Anakin failed and fell to the dark side. Empire Strikes Back has the Rebellion lose on Hoth, Han getting captured, and Luke failing at saving Han and almost dying because he thought he could magically save the day. Return of the Jedi ends with Vader/Anakin having to sacrifice himself just so his son could survive and the Rebellion could win. I don't understand why people think that this is a series like a superhero movie where the good side always wins.

It's getting to the point where I just think people are looking for something to complain about or to dislike what's popular because it's edgy. Most people I meet offline liked TLJ, or didn't watch it because they saw TFA and hated it so they aren't bothering with the new trilogy.

Who was the best man at Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala's wedding?,"We know for certain that the two attendees to the wedding with places of honor were C-3P0 and R2-D2. It's left unclear however which of them was responsible for the organization and pre-planning duties that are traditionally allotted to the best man. 

Given that Threepio was created by Anakin it would at first blush seem natural to attribute to him the honor of best man. However when it comes down to it, Artoo would clearly have been the better fit for the role due to his innate ability to liven up a party, along with his outgoing personality and willingness to go the extra mile for a friend even when rules need to be broken.

Cool Musical Easter Egg in TLJ,"&gt; So, the Easter egg comes as the Fathiers are wreaking havoc in the casino and we cut to the inside of a confectionery shop. There’s an abrupt edit where all the music stops and you hear this sort of lounge piano that’s playing, like a piece of source music. That lounge piano is actually John Williams playing “The Long Goodbye,” which is the score that he wrote for the film The Long Goodbye. Rian is a huge fan of that score and he somehow managed to get John Williams to put that into the Star Wars film. It’s a wonderful little Easter egg.

&gt; On that day that John sat down and played “The Long Goodbye” piano piece, Rian was so excited that he pulled out his iPhone and filmed the whole thing. John said, “Only for you, Rian, do I do this.” It was a very special moment.

This quote comes from [this interview](http://postperspective.com/ren-klyce-mixing-score-star-wars-last-jedi/) with Ren Klyce, Co-Supervising Sound Editor, Sound Designer, and Re-Recording Mixer on TLJ.

* 3) but X-wings require Astromech droids to calculate the jumps in Hyperspace...and R2-D2 wasn't with him...so...how'd he get there without R2's help, since R2 was left behind?

Bruce Wayne and Luke Skywalker both went into exile and left it for similar reasons,"**Batman and Luke both believe that the public need something better than what they represent.**

They take actions deliberately that on the surface to outsiders tarnish their image but to them go deeper. They are willing to themselves seem weak because they can handle that if it means that something better rises in their absence.

In Batman’s case it’s his hope that by him stepping away and taking the blame the public will gain hope in the justice system and take Gotham back. In Luke’s case it’s his hope that by him stepping away and removing the Jedi from the chess board that something better than Jedi will rise to lead to balance because, to him, to think that the Light side of the force only belongs to the Jedi is vanity. He wants something new. He just isn’t sure what it is.

**Both are in exile for years and this process beats them up and eats away at them because it takes a lot of strength to stick to it and trust that it will work out.**

**Both are met by young people who believed in them.**

In Batman’s case that’s John Blake. In Luke Skywalker’s case it’s Rey. Both of these new people update them on how bad things are getting and start them on their curiosity journeys back and take steps back.

**Both are then motivated further by people they care about.**
In Batman’s case it’s Selina. In Luke’s case it’s Leia.

Both are then motivated further by older mentors. In Batman’s case it’s Alfred. In Luke’s case it’s Yoda.

Where the concepts here differ is that the Dark Knight Rises was Batman’s movie whereas The Last Jedi is more about how the Light and Dark are trying to convert Rey of Jakku in the end and she chooses in the end to become the Last Jedi.

Beyond the middle sections, which differ in agency because Batman is a superhero and it’s his trilogy, and Luke Skywalker, who is at the end of his life, and whose agency shifts to Rey and her choices, the endings explore a similar concept as well. The notion that both Luke and Batman were neither 100% right nor wrong in what they attempted. In Batman’s case the public did find hope until Bane took it away again. In Luke’s case the absence of Jedi and his disconnect from the Force lead to the Force finding the only person in the galaxy that Ben Solo seems to care about beyond himself and his mother: Rey. In the end both Batman and Luke realize that the role of what they represent isn’t just to be the ones who stop everything all the time and who the public wait on to save the day but to also provide hope and inspire the public themselves to be more versus darkness.

**John Blake inherits the Bat cave. Rey of Jakku inherits the Ancient Jedi Texts Luke had been living with. **
Bruce Wayne retires in the sun with the people most important to him. Luke Skywalker becomes one with the Light and will soon see Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda again.

My biggest problem with the Sequel Trilogy is its design of The First Order,"I don’t necessarily mean aesthetic design, but I mean the design of The First Order’s setting from the start of The Force Awakens.

It doesn’t make sense that The First Order exists. After Return of the Jedi, the Empire essentially lost. It makes sense that there should be some form of entity from that organization to rise again, but I think the resources they’d have would be very little. So, for 30 years after RotJ, to have Starkiller Base (a bigger Death Star), and a new Empire-esque organization, seems absurd. 

Where did they pool enough resources to create something bigger? How did they recruit more people in believing in The First Order? 

If the First Order truly exists in this universe, I would imagine, after looking at these questions, we’d have a much better antagonizing force against our main protagonists. Not only that, but maybe even the physical design of its armor, ships, vehicles, and weapons would reflect some form of evolution. Maybe even moreso to the point where The Resistance might have altered its own arsenal to combat against The First Order. 

I just wish the Sequel Trilogy had more evolution.

Toys R Us is closing down. Are kids not wanting SW toys?,"I spent my childhood surfing the star wars sections of Toys R Us after the 1997 special editions came out. Feckin loved the stuff, and even the prequels had some fantastic designs and models. 
 I've been really shocked to see the quality of the newer stuff as well as the amount that seems to have been unsold. I've seen a ton of stuff from the reboots in major bargain and discount stores across the UK for years now.. And not just the crap stuff but the decent models!  

I realize that toys are taking a hit with everything moving online and whatever and also maybe im out of touch with kids today and what they play, but just before Christmas the company was positive of finding a buyer and only having to scale back, in the UK at least... Does that mean they were hoping for the big two (Lego and star wars) to thrive over Xmas like they have done before? I mean there's so much SW stock its unreal..

Its just a thought, and one I know has been debated before by certain youtubers and bloggers. Bit yeah...  Its the worlds biggest franchise and its was all based on toys. So what's going on?

The Last Jedi Novel on how Rey was able to access the force and learn to use her abilities so fast,"Kylo had rummaged through these hopes and fears, things he had no right to. But as he searched, something had changed. Even as he callously rifled through her mind, he had somehow revealed his own. Rey found herself in his mind even as he invaded hers. She felt his rage, like a ruinous storm that filled his head, and his hatred, and his lust to dominate and humiliate those who had wronged him. But she also felt his hurt, and his loneliness. And his fear—that he would never prove as strong as Darth Vader, the ghost who haunted his dreams.
Kylo had retreated at finding Rey in his head—had practically fled from her. But that had not been the end of that strange, sudden connection. She had seen more—far more. Somehow, almost instinctually, she knew how he accessed some of the powers at his command—even though she didn’t understand them. It was as if his training had become hers, unlocking and flinging open door after door in her mind.
But now Rey couldn’t shut those doors—and she feared what had been set loose


&gt;she knew how he accessed some of the powers at his command—even though she didn’t understand them.

So there we have it. Canon confirmation of the idea that she downloaded kylo's training and understanding of the force to some degree. 

Also I read ahead to the battle on the Supremacy and it gives a much better picture of her being on her back foot and out matched/ barely holding her own than I think the movie its self did.

&gt;Rey fell backward, bumping into Kylo’s back. Her lightsaber rose and fell, wheeling in sweeps as the guards came at her from a bewildering variety of angles.
There were too many attacks to keep track of, suddenly, and she felt her heart begin to hammer.

&gt;She tried to anticipate her attackers’ motions, using the Force to warn her where they would be. But they were everywhere now, hot and bright in her perceptions. She just barely dodged a slash at her face, so close she could smell ozone.
It was too much—even with the Force. She was tiring, and her impressions felt like they would drown her: Sensations of life, death, light, and dark poured in on her from all directions. It was too much, a challenge bigger than what her limited training had prepared her for.

And it also makes it read like its more the Forces' doing than hers when it comes to the fight. As if she is right now just a vessel for its will and not the one driving it. 

&gt;Rey reached out with her hand and shoved one guard backward with the Force, then found herself spinning in the other direction

&gt;She couldn’t direct the Force well enough to last long against three elite warriors in lightsaber-resistant armor. But she could let it direct her, allow it to make her its instrument.

Also the way the lightsaber is described during her training with it at the bolder is very pretty and seems a lot more High Fantasy with it being a focus for the force and not just a weapon

&gt;The lightsaber felt different in her hands—it was heavier and there was none of the additional momentum supplied by the counterweight of her staff. But the principles weren’t too different. And the lightsaber seemed alive in her hands somehow—as if something inside it were simultaneously focusing her strength and guiding her thrusts and parries. Her sense of the energy around her felt sharpened, and the song of the blade seemed to resonate with the currents of the Force surrounding her, amplifying them.

Edit: Their is just so much to parse from this book. I will say again that Jason Fry, being the guy who created a lot of the lore for Legends and Canon, was the perfect choice for this book and to make it and its story better fit the world and characters.

[SPOILERS] The Misadventures of Rose &amp; Finn. A long rant about Rose Tico.,"[SPOILERS] A little backstory: I've avoided any essential plot spoilers for the movie until yesterday. Finally watched The Last Jedi yesterday and re-watched it today and I am so confused with Rose Tico.

Upon introduction of her character, she meets Finn and calls him a Resistance Hero. Next thing you know, she stunned him and doesn't listen to his explanation and immediately wants to report to the brig for desertion.

Firstly, how does she know that Finn isn't going on a secret need-to-know-only-basis mission that he can't tell anyone? And time would be of an essence so assuming that there is a mission that Finn (A RESISTANCE HERO) is on would be heavily compromised. 

Secondly, she works pipes all day. She wouldn't know how Leadership worked and who they would send for missions. Again, why would she immediately stun people for ""desertion"". The other 6 people might have be deserting sure but what if they also had missions? Rose Tico wouldn't know. Because she just stuns them because she's a sad girl.

Shooting along after discussing with Maz Kanata, the duo of Finn and Rose managed to go to Canto Bight without anyone else knowing except for Poe and other important people. How? If Rose Tico managed to stun 6 other people for desertion, why aren't there anymore ""Rose Ticos"" going around stunning people who are going to their spacecrafts or escape pods and report them in for desertion? Is Rose Tico the only anti-traitorous and anti-deserting person on the ship? I'd assume that there would be more people who lost loved ones as well and/or are against deserters. How?

Gambling along in Canto Bight, looking for Red Plom Bloom man, we the audience are told that the fleet has 18 hours of fuel reserves left. Sure that's a lot of time, but instead of continuing their search, the duo immediately decides to look at Fathiers and have a heart to heart talk about slaves and poorly treated animals. And they just left the search to BB8. They could have easily found Red Plom Bloom Man and at least talked to him before being stunned and arrested and explained their situation and possibly return to the fleet earlier. I'm no screenwriter but I feel that this character development was such a barrier to plot progression. Back in jail, fuel reserves are left at 6 hours. So essentially, they spent 12 hours flying to Canto Blight and searching for RPBMan only to end up in jail. That's a really long time spent. Why?

Diving along in Canto Casino, Rose mentions that she hates rich scum because they trade weapons for cash. She would rather punch the place with her fist than to stay there. But wait! Isn't RPBMan a rich scum? Does Rose and Finn know that he doesn't deal in weaponry? For all they know, he might be one of the major contributors to the First Order's arsenal. If she doesn't trust rich people, why trust Maz Kanata's words? A person she probably has never seen before? What?

DJ-ing in Canto Blight Jail, the duo meet up with the character DJ for the first time. The conversation between Rose and Finn was loud enough for DJ to hear them. Rose decides to LOUDLY mention them getting a code breaker for Snoke's ship. Knowing that the First Order is something like the Empire, wouldn't there be as much First Order Sympathizers in the entire galaxy? Why would Rose Tico blatantly speak of their plans only for it to be overheard by anyone around them. Why does she keep ruining our plans?! Not only that, DJ explicitly says ""Old Man Snoke"". Wouldn't that trigger something in Rose or Finn into thinking that ""Hey? How does this guy know Snoke and why does he refer to him as ""Old Man Snoke""? Hello??? I know that the Resistance Fleet is running out of time and they're in a hurry to find RPBMan but instead of letting DJ help them out of their cell, they pretend like everything is A-okay and proceeds to sit on their bed. Mr DJ unlocks their cell and walks in one direction but Rose decides that she knows the layout better than anyone and says ""This way!"" Huh?

Swimming out of Canto Sewers to Canto Cages, the duo happens upon the Fathiers. I've ridden on horses but on my first time it was Hella hard to stay on the saddle. So how in the flying Fathiers do they stay on the Fathiers that is running so fast, how do they control the Fathier's direction and speed and what in the heck am I talking about. I'd assume Fathiers would act like any mounted animal. 

Galloping into Canto Crops, after they were hastily dismounted by the Fathiers, why can't they just hide under the crops? Why do they gotta act like ""Oh no we-a trapped. Mamma mia. Whatta we gonna do-a?"" Perhaps the cops were using scanners but for all they knew, they couldn't possibly be tracking them or scanning for them. Why just stand there?

Salting along to Crait.
When Finn decides to sacrifice himself to destroy the Battering Ram Laser, which would definitely buy the Resistance enough time to notice the missing Ice Puppies and find their way out of the base, Rose Tico decides to stop Finn from doing so and allow the Battering Ram Laser to fire.

Rose Tico wouldn't know of Luke's somewhat Arrival to Crait neither would she know of anything that would happen thereafter. So essentially, Rose Tico WOULD HAVE singlehandedly destroyed The remaining Resistance out of ""love""? 

I am so confused as to what her purpose is in the movie. To any Rose Tico fans, I do apologize for anything that this post might cause.",StarWars,True,1521042232,2018-03-14
Rian Johnson cannot write female or pre-existing characters.,"Upon observation of his older films, they seem to have very littleness presence or lack proper characterization. In Looper, the mother of a “prodigy” didn’t have much in the way of agency despite being one of the more interesting characters in the film. This falls into TLJ.

Holdo is a bitch and treats Poe like dirt without telling him the plan(he did like it didn’t he? So why withhold it?). Rose is a character who further proves that Finn didn’t need her as what he needed was development of of his own but also displayed an insult to Finns intelligence in the final act. This more so has to deal with Rian’s poor writing about concepts running the story, rather than what usually worked for SW.

Then you get into Rey. She is the concept that needs to hold up the film and she was used horribly. All of a sudden she gets stronger because Kylo does. She knows about the Galaxy far more than what she did 10 seconds ago in TFA and starts talking about the light/darkside as if she’s knows everything. But this is a  talk about Rey being female so I’ll continue.

Rey falls for Kylo and Rian supports it. This is detrimental Young Audlt/fan fiction writing where the bad boy is getting “saved” by the perfect bland as fuck pure girl of no consequence. 50 shades of Grey? Pretty much. What’s worse is that she forgets everything he’s done and once again, has all of this knowledge all of a sudden. There is no logical reasoning for it and the defenses of Rey’s motivations in “all of this” is disappointing. Han/Anakin we’re similar in that they had this “edge” to them but the difference between the two is they mostly treated their lovers with respect(Han can be argued but it was a lover quarrel. He at least didn’t murder someones father figure and basically kill their friend).
which got the girls in return to fall for them more.

Rey loving Kylo reduces her down even further from what she wasn’t before. 

And as for the pre-existing characters; 

Leia hasn’t no dialogue and is treated as a background cameo in both films(far more in TLJ). Watto has more dialogue than her..The two commentators pin TPM have more than her, Sami has more despite being the grandmother who could have easily been written out(fantastic character by the way) her own husband gets a momumentus amount of screen time and she gets none.

I just don’t get the praise this movie gets for treating everyone “right”

How Holdo's maneuver is described in the Last Jedi Novel,"Under ordinary operations, the presence of a sizable object along the route between the Raddus’s realspace position and its entry point into hyperspace would have caused the heavy cruiser’s fail-safes to cut in and shut down the hyperdrive.


But with the fail-safes offline and the overrides activated, the proximity alerts were ignored. When the heavy cruiser plowed into the Supremacy’s broad flying wing, the force of the impact was at least three orders of magnitude greater than anything the Raddus’s inertial dampeners were rated to handle. The protective field they generated failed immediately, but the heavy cruiser’s augmented experimental shields remained intact for a moment longer before the unimaginable force of the impact converted the Raddus into a column of plasma that consumed itself. However, the Raddus had also accelerated to nearly the speed of light at the point of that catastrophic impact- and the column of plasma it became was hotter than a sun and intensely magnetized. This plasma was then hurled into hyperspace along a tunnel opened by the null quantum-field generator—a tunnel that collapsed as quickly as it had been opened.

Both the column of plasma and the hyperspace tunnel were gone in far less than an eyeblink, but that was long enough to rip through the Supremacy’s hull from bow to stern, tear a ragged hole in a string of Star Destroyers flying in formation with it, and finally wink out of existence in empty space thousands of kilometers beyond the First Order task force",StarWars,True,1521043266,2018-03-14

[Spoilers] Clarification of TLJ Novel Rey Power,"So...  Rey was so powerful in TLJ due to Snoke’s force bridge. The novel states that she was able to view and absorb Kylo Ben’s force knowledge and ability. 

So...  why do the Jedi even train?  If you can just Matrix “I know king fu” years of force training why was there a school?  Why not just jack the Padawans into Master Yoda’s brain and have them ready to go. 

What about outfitting an entire clone battalion with force knowledge. They might not have the ability but they knew Dooku was a threat, some defensive techniques would be good, right?

This cannon obliteration is a bridge too far. If you’re not going to treat the story seriously then why should I?  What the hell?!  I enjoyed TLJ upon first viewing but some nagging things bothered me as time went on. 

But this...  c’mon!

And before anyone says anything about it being against the Jedi way, why didn’t The Senate bridge with a battalion of Stormtroopers and give them just enough knowledge to be backflipping all over the place, or at least improve their aim. 

Yeah, yeah forgotten technique. Palpatine was supposed to be the ultimate Sith, and Yoda knew about the Jedi texts so I’m sure he knew. This just bothers the ever loving hell out of me.

Why are all the films' main protagonists around the same age every time?,"Luke-19-23 through his trilogy.

Rey-19-unknown but likely mid 20s through hers.

Anakin-20 and 23 during two of his films, Phantom Menace being an obvious exception.

Han is going to be 18-24 through his film, taking place over the 6 years 11 BBY-5 BBY.

Is it just me or is that getting a little overly repeated? I know we have exceptions with Ezra and the other main characters, Kenobi, OT Han and so on but every time the films' guys are all around the same age. 

This is one of the factors that makes me want Obi Wan's films, if it happens, to be primarily some journey after Mustafar and Order 66, to show  a more weathered step.  I've never played the Old Republic stuff, so I'd be happy to be proven a little bit more wrong when it comes to that.

So I watched the new sequels with my father.,"My dad is a bit unique when it comes to Star Wars. He absolutely adored A New Hope, and saw it in theatres during the original run. He was a huge fan and especially loved George Lucas’ encorporation of Joseph Campbell’s “Hero Journey” archetypes. That’s primarily what he loved about the film. He did not care much for Empire at all, nor did he like Return of the Jedi. I made him sit through the prequels when I was a teenager, and he always grinned and bore it, but he did not like them at all. 

Fast forward to a couple months ago. I played The Force Awakens at my parent’s house, and he kept walking into the room and standing there— he doesn’t like to watch movies much, but he eventually sat down and watched the whole film after about 20 minutes of standing there. He really enjoyed Finn and Rey in particular, and loved the structure being similar to the Star Wars he loved when he was younger.

I put on Rogue One a week or so later. He likes war movies, so I figured he may enjoy it. He was captivated by the last half of the movie, but didn’t love the first half. He thought it was visually incredible. I caught him biting his nails toward the end, something he does when he is totally engrossed.

I just watched TLJ at their house, and my father absolutely loved it. He says it’s the best Star Wars movie— well put together, and everything. I don’t personally agree that it’s the best, but the man was gushing. He never really gets that complimentary about things like this, so it fired me up to write this post. He’s a bit of a cranky dude so seeing him enjoy himself so much on a franchise he wrote off 35+ years ago is so nice to see. He really loves the Rey story, he was a huge fan of Snoke (he LOVES LOTR and Gollum), and thought the Luke projection was “one of the coolest tricks in the series.” 

So, for those counting, he loves Episode 4, 7, 8 and Rogue One only. Lol. Weirdest list ever for a Star Wars fan.",StarWars,True,1521048557,2018-03-14

Identity of the Mysterious Figure in Darth Vader #13? [SPOILERS],"Who is the Jedi advising the Mon Cala king? In my view, whoever it is needs to be:

* Somebody ""important"", otherwise they wouldn't have bothered concealing his identity
* Somebody who previously knew Anakin, and knows who/what he has become
* Somebody that we didn't actually *see* die.

The most obvious choice, given his previous experience with the Mon Cala, would have been Kit Fisto. However, we know he went down like a total punk, so it's probably not him. Fun and shocking, but very unlikely options would be somebody like Plo Koon or even Mace Windu.

The other day, I was watching Homeland and notice this actor by the name of Linus Roache (also from the UK I believe) sort of resembled him, and made me question, what would Disney do if they did a standalone movie? I'd imagine they'd have to go to his much younger years. So, I decided to ask the question on here and share these pictures. I personally do not care what they do, I just would love a standalone movie on his character as he is my favorite. Thanks.

A thought about holograms,"I was reading a book and in it there was a secret passage hidden behind a hologram, which gave me a thought. In Star Wars most of the holograms we see are blue tinted with static lines, but occasionally you do see a lifelike hologram but always in a criminal pursuit. 

What if commercial holograms are deliberately made to not look to life like because it is illegal to make a hologram capable of perfect replication. 

The number of criminal uses for such a hologram would be immense, enough perhaps for the Senate to get involved and declare all holograms must have an easily identifiable flaw and industry standard became the blue tint.",StarWars,True,1521072709,2018-03-14

So about tragedy of The Clone Wars TV series.,"When you think about it George must of really not liked Clone Wars enough that he didn't have an interest in finishing it at all especially for how much money he was pumping into it. Lucas went and made one of the most expensive animated TV series spending around 1 million per episode of his own money and then decides that he doesn't even want to bother finishing it. Then sells the entire Star Wars franchise to Disney.

I mean damn if I was spending that kind of effort and money into something I'd at least want to finish it, but i'm also not filthy rich. Thinking about all of this tho is just like ... Damn lol",StarWars,True,1521080570,2018-03-14

IX has to be a monument.,"I'll precede this by saying that I loved TFA/TLJ to the furthest extent a broke star wars fan as myself can. If that puts you off, I'm sorry.

If I sound like a broken record, I apologize. 

I believe it finally hit me a few minutes ago that IX will be the end of the Skywalker saga. As it's been said before, star wars is the tragedy of Darth Vader, his beginning, his end, and the aftermath of his life.
After TLJ, I initially joined the craze of ""Oh boy, I can't wait to see if Rey's staff is gonna be repurposed as a lightsaber"" or ""Oh man I can't wait to see the Knights of Ren be badass"". But after a few months, I find myself tiring of the speculation, exhausted of the mystery box. 

All I find myself caring about is how they end this saga. 

All I want is a fitting, slow, thoughtful third act to the third act of a trilogy of trilogies. 

I'm not going to be speculating, and I'm not going to weigh in on how I think the plot's going to go, but I will give a simple list of *wants*. 

I know none of this will happen more than likely, but it's a way to let out my thoughts and calm my head.

- Tribute to the prequels. Honestly, I hate the prequels. I Dislike 2/3 of it and can tolerate The Phantom Menace, but as a child growing up with them, I could overlook their flaws and enjoy the ideas they presented. I love Darth Maul. I love the raw emotion Ewan McGregor expels as his master is killed, or when his brother is brutally disfigured at his hand. The tear that rolls down Anakin's cheek as he gives himself over to evil. I'm a forever fan of TCW. If IX could give a fitting tribute to the prequels, whether it be through choreography, story elements, or something else, I would be eternally grateful.

- Tribute to Darth Vader. Honestly, the only popular speculation I can agree with is Hayden Christensen's force ghost. 
Seeing where Rey is in TLJ emotionally, I would love to see AOTC's padawan Anakin having long dialogues with Rey. (I want a more dialogue-heavy movie if I'm being honest.) 
I also want, not as much, but all the same, Anakin's ghost (As Darth Vader) to face Kylo Ren, and acknowledge the ashen helmet that he treasures. 

- If there is a fight, it has to be good. If I could choose, I would have one that goes through all the fighting styles of the saga. Perhaps the fight starts with Prequel era fighting, epic, scale, spectacle. It burns down and the opponents are left to stay more quiet, slow, thoughtful, precise like in the Original Trilogy. 
And finally, the fight ramps back up with the style of the Sequel's brutally medieval duels, personal, rage induced, inaccurate, blind, realistic.

- Overall though, I know that everyone clamors for the final installment to be epic and gratifying, but my soul yearns for something far more quiet and sincere. I think it would be far better in the long run if people had a movie to look back on and appreciate for the quality, not spectacle.

Thanks for listening to my rambling. 


EDIT: Grammar

EDIT 2: If you guys have thoughts, I'd love to read them. But please not too much negativity about TLJ or anything. I'm tired of it and I think it would be beneficial for positive thoughts to be shared.


**EDIT 3:** 
Now that I'm actually awake and less emotional I can add something to the list that I meant to mention last night, but forgot.

Rebels, while I do not like it (Mostly because of the characters), had a very interesting episode near the end of its lifespan. *World Between Worlds* introduced time travel and the concept of dimensions to the star wars canon. 
Considering that a few JJ Abrams' directed/showran series included a sudden time travel element near the end... Could that mean that IX has some form of time travel? At first, when I thought of it, I absolutely hated the idea. Abhorred it. But over some time I became used to the idea, and while I *hope* that it doesn't spawn a bunch of storylines that actually include elements of *infinities* while remaining noncanon (WINK WINK), I wouldn't mind if IX had something that could potentially pit Rey or Kylo against the past itself. 

Yes, I know that's ridiculous. Yes, I know that's the mad dream of a fanboy, but if it was done respectfully and well, we could experience a dagobah cave-esq journey through the history of Star Wars. (Like, just imagine Rey fighting Maul.) And as RLM would say, that's *very* cool.",StarWars,True,1521084995,2018-03-14
Team Holdo,"Many people have complained, myself included, that the Holdo storyline would function better if Holdo just told Poe the plan... except that Poe and everyone else already knows the plan. 

As soon as Leia realizes they are being tracked through lightspeed, it is announced that the next move is to find a base where they can send out a strong distress signal. When Holdo is made leader, Poe even tells her that if they are going to safely find a base then they need to lose the first order. He knows the plan is to find a base, he just doesn't know how they'll do it and at that moment neither does Holdo. After that, pretty much every interaction between them involves Poe being a dick because, despite his demotion, he felt entitled to the leadership role.

When Finn tells Poe the plan to eliminate the tracker, Poe's first question is ""so we blow that one up?"" The whole point is he doesn't think tactfully and learns that you can't just power through every obstacle. He's good at jumping in a ship and blowing things up, Leia wants him to be better than that.",StarWars,True,1521085296,2018-03-14

[The Last Jedi Spoilers] Canto Bight Actually Had A Purpose,"Please hear me out and pass this along in the name of fair/balanced film criticism, that's all I ask of you all, I just realized this about an hour ago and I've been sitting on it ever since.

People say the Canto Bight subplot was only meant to push an anti 1% message, and that it had no bearing on the film...

But what if I told you that's actually wrong? Look, let's backtrack into the subplot, Finn and Rose both meet DJ in the prison cell when they are arrested attempting to find the Code Breaker, they break out with him and BB-8, and head back toward Snoke's ship. 

Poe contacts Finn on his comm and Finn answers, and Poe tells Finn that Holdo's fueling up the transports for an evacuation, there is a shot of DJ clearly listening and acknowledging this fact. Come a while later and DJ relays this information back to the First Order.

Do you get what this means? If the Canto Bight subplot never happened, the Resistance would've been able to hide on Crait until the First Order passed overhead, thus: Luke never would've died the peaceful death he deserved, Kylo never would've been haunted by his failed revenge, Rey wouldn't have been able to escape the Supremacy in the chaos of the kamikaze, and the Resistance never would've been whittled down. The third act of the film would have never happened if Finn and Rose never left the ship.",StarWars,True,1521089099,2018-03-15

How does Yoda using the force in TLJ affect what we know about force ghosts?,"for the entirety of the saga, it has been pretty clear that force ghosts are wise guardians and teachers, who can't directly affect the physical world. Rather they offer wisdom and advice to those they see fit. This all changes with TLJ, where we see Yoda's spirit summon lightning to destroy the force tree. Now personally the Yoda scene was my favorite in TLJ, but this still irks me. If force ghosts can have this kind of power on the physical world, why did Obi-Wan in the OT not offer Luke more help? Surely if Yoda can summon a bolt of lightning to blow a tree to pieces, Obi-Wan could've just done this exact thing when he died in ANH and killed Vader. He even says there is no point in redeeming Vader several times in the OT, so he shouldn't have any emotional dilemma about fucking him up as a ghost. This all begs the question: why did Rian Johnson completely change the way force ghosts interact with the world? Did he just think it looked cool? Did he legitimately not understand that Yoda striking the tree messed with the continuity of the entire franchise? I personally hope showing this power now is setting the stage for something awesome with Ghost Luke in Ep.IX.

 I also think it was an interesting choice by the director to use lightning to destroy the tree, which is usually seen as a dark side power. Seeing as how Yoda clearly didn't use hatred or anger to bring down the tree, could we possibly see more light siders use lightning in the future installments? It would be kind of disappointing if we just see Yoda show off these godlike powers once, and nothing ever comes of it again. If the writers are going to change the way force ghosts work at a fundamental level like this, they should at least embrace it and build on these powers, instead of just showing God Yoda blow up a tree once and then forget all about it.

Did anyone else see TLJ as a big F*U to JJ Abrams and TFA from Rian?,"After watching TLJ for the third or fourth time now I've really come to the conclusion there are many points in this movie where it feels as though Rian is giving the middle finger (figuratively of course) to JJ Abrams and TFA. I'll try and explain my reasoning as best as possible below.

Rian was given Episode 8 with no treatment and zero information aside from what we all know by watching TFA. With that in mind, I can only assume Rian was incredibly pissed off by many of Abrams choices and as such set forth to correct them. Whether you agree that they needed correcting or not is just personal opinion and not what I'm discussing.

&gt; TFA Ending... Handing over the Lightsaber to Luke and just ending it there on a cliff hanger thus forcing the next Director to deal with said scene forcing them into a box of continuing the movie from that moment.

* Luke Skywalker throws the Lightsaber away over his shoulder 

&gt; Episode 4 Rehash #1 - Kylo Ren's ridiculous helmet

* Snoke makes fun of Kylo, ""Child in a mask"". Thus resulting in Kylo destroying said mask and doing more progression as a character in 2 minutes than the whole of TFA

&gt; Kylo Ren's image as a whiny Emo kid

* This is corrected many times over in TLJ not only with the script but also showing him as more than a Son or child playing dress-up and pretending to be Darth Vader. Also, damn he's built in that shirtless scene (wife likes to remind me of this point).

&gt; Episode 4 Rehash #2 - BBG (Big Bad Guy) with zero story, background, or interest yet somehow plays a larg part... This works in Ep 4 because it was the start of the movies and it gave a sense of mystery with the Emperor. This does not work when you are on Episode 7 and working with already established characters.

* He's killed outright both pushing the story forward and giving great character progression to both Kylo and Rey.

&gt; Worst Movie Trope: Not every ensemble needs an idiot... Finn

* TLJ tries to give Finn a much better and stronger character without re-writing him entirely.

&gt; Rey is secretly someone special... (considering Abrams own writing style I doubt even he had any ideas as to who her parents would be)

* Rey came from nowhere and from nobody of importance in the Star Wars pantheon. Her parents were junkers from Jakku who traded their daughter for a one-way ticket off the planet. That’s it, no illustrious or noble bloodline; no special heritage. This leads into the next part...

&gt; Rey is powerful and kicks Kylo's ass in TFA with zero training in the Lightsaber or how to use the Force. Breaking ALL previous established cannon in Episode 4

* Snoke points out this fact while admonishing Kylo, pointing out how pathetic it was.

&gt; Rey and Leia hug while ignoring Chewie at the end of TFA (They don't even know who each other are...)

* Obvious hug between Chewie and Leia to make up for TFA

I'm sure there may be more but these are the ones that kinda popped out to me while watching TLJ. Did anyone else get this sense of ""F*U JJ"" with some of these moments in TLJ?",StarWars,True,1521096401,2018-03-15

What was Luke’s plan to save Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt?,"   I’ve seen a lot of websites writing about Luke’s plan to save Han from Jabba the Hutt recently, and apparently exactly what the plan was has been sparking a lot of debate.

   I don’t know why this question is blowing up now, of all times, but I feel like people might be overthinking this a little. Sure, maybe Lucas had no idea what the plan was, and it would have been nice if the plan was explained just a little in the film, but I think the simplest answer is the most satisfying one.

   I think Luke's plan was to get to the Sarlaac all along, and to get as much back-up there for the escape as possible.

   How does this work? It works under the assumption that Lando has learned the ins-and-outs of Jabba's palace since he has been undercover and has been informing Luke of what he’s been learning, which the movie seems to imply. Maybe Lando came to the conclusion that escaping the palace was almost impossible, and Jabba would be unwilling to bargain. Jabba himself is practically untouchable, but one of the few times Jabba leaves his palace with only a portion of his guards is when he goes to the Pit of Carkoon for executions. So, instead of someone having to escape the heavily fortified palace, Jabba literally takes prisoners out of his fortress and practically hands them a getaway vehicle (the skiffs).

   With this in mind, things can start to make more sense. Luke ""gifted"" the droids to Jabba in order to get them conveniently placed jobs that get them on the inside (maybe Lando sabotaged the previous barge droid and translator). Chewbacca was brought in as extra muscle for the sail barge escape and as a ticket for Leia to get in. Leia's mission was to get Han out of carbonite, but she went in knowing that actual escape was unlikely. I don't think they planned for Leia to be made into a slave, but Leia did make it work in the end. Bottomline, Han had to be let out, otherwise he would be left frozen in the palace while everyone else went to the Sarlaac to be killed.

   And if you think about it, Lando could have let Han out himself, but actually getting out of the palace was pretty much impossible, and they needed as much back-up as possible for the sail barge escape, which I think was why Leia and Chewie were brought into it. And with Lando compromised, they wouldn't have anyone on the inside to make sure that all the pieces were where they needed to be.

   Then it comes down to Luke. Luke's first job would be to take out the Rancor, the only other man-eating creature keeping them from the Sarlaac (and their escape). I think Lando obviously would have told Luke about the trap floor, which makes me think falling into the Rancor Pit and shutting the door on it was intentional. Once that inital means of execution was out of the way, the only thing left to satisfy Jabba’s well-known ego and anger was to kill his enemies with the Sarlaac. Everything points to it; R2, Chewie and Luke seem confident the whole time, R2 is exactly where he needs to be with the lightsaber, and everybody is nodding their heads at each other like this is exactly where they wanted to be. Also I don't think they let C-3PO on it because 1) he never shuts up long enough to keep a secret, and 2) to add authenticity to their plan. If he freaks out, it makes them seem like they really don’t have a plan. 3) Comic relief.

   And sure, there are still probably some nitpicks, but I think the evidence for this being the most likely plan is there.

   After Han gets thrown in a cell with Chewie, he mentions Luke and believes that he is coming. To me, this hints at it being all one plan. Even after Leia’s plan “fails”, Chewie still seems pretty confident. And on the way to the Sarlaac, these two lines are said by 3PO and Luke:

C-3PO to R2: “I wish I had your confidence.”

Luke to Han: “Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I’ve taken care of everything.”

   Yeah, this plan seems to rely on a lot of chances, but this plan was made by the greatest gambler in the galaxy and a future-seeing Jedi Knight. It was crazy enough to just work.

   I don’t know if this is what Lucas and Kasdan thought of, but it is good enough for me for whenever I watch Return of the Jedi from now on. Regardless, it’s fun to speculate and hear people’s theories. These discussions are half of the fun of being a Star Wars fan I think.

**TL;DR The Han Rescue Plan was to get to the Sarlaac Pit. It was the easiest way to get everyone out of the palace, away from the majority of Jabba’s defenses, and to get a free getaway vehicle.**

What to watch/read?,"Hey guys, I'm doing a rewatch of all the Star Wars movies, as well as the Clone Wars and watching Rebels for the first time.

"Theory: Maz Kanata will defeat Chewbacca in the new ""Solo"" movie","Maz, the little grandmotherly alien who runs the bar Han Solo visited in ""The Force Awakens"", is much more powerful than she seems.

The moment Han appears, Maz roars out ""HAN SOLO!"" and EVERYONE in the bustling cantina freezes, including Han. He actually seems scared.

Many creatures must have vied to get Luke Skywalker's legendary light-saber. But out of all interested parties in the galaxy, it ended up with Maz. Why? This wouldn't have happened unless there was something special about her.

""The Last Jedi"" shows us why: Finn and his team contact Maz when she's in the middle of some pitched blaster battle. Yet Maz makes it look easy, dishing out calm advice in between dishing out serious moves to her unseen opponents. It's like she's the Yoda of blasters.

Then Maz flies off.. in a JETPACK. Boba Fett style. Maz's secret is she's a Mandalorian, one of the greatest warriors in the galaxy.

Maz has a clear history with Han and Chewie. And she fearlessly refers to the giant Wookie as ""My Boyfriend"".

But if this affection is real, Chewie doesn't reciprocate it, choosing to stay with the ship instead of following Han to meet Maz. It seems Maz is using this term as a jape.

We've seen Chewie get mad before over less, he doesn't take guff from anyone. But he does take guff from Maz because MAZ IS SCARY! Little Grandma has a much higher power level than anyone would guess from looking at her.

My guess? At some point in the past Han and Chewie has a run in with Maz. And over some circumstance, Chewie make the profound mistake of trying to actually FIGHT MAZ, thinking the shrimpy wise woman would be easy to beat.

Only to learn, too late, the true magnitude of his mistake as Maz publicly humiliated him in epic fashion. Leaving him stuck with the moniker ""Boyfriend"" ever since.

This battle happened long before ""The Force Awakens"". But this clear shout-out to a past event in Han and Chewie's history is a Chekhov's Gun that the movies have to reference again at some point. Especially since the scene is so sweet!

And the most likely place for this callback to happen is in the upcoming ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" film coming this May.

So my theory is that Maz the Mandalorian will completely own Chewbacca in a fight in ""Solo"".",StarWars,True,1520122797,2018-03-03

The effects for the most part were not that bad save for Jabba and some greenscreen at Coruscant, the only really questionable dialogue and/or delivery was by Nightly as fake Amidala and a line or two from Ani, who wasn't as bad as I expected, particularly with his tone and inflection (Ian McDirmid golden as always). While I can see some being bored by a lot of the talking and plot I had fun dissecting the plans of the parties involved and thinking about the world building involved in it (she did as well). Podracing was a lot of fun and somehow not having a score kind of elevated the whole sequence in terms of tension to me.

What do you want to see each main character dealing with in IX?,"Rey: She's trying to put together a new Jedi Order.  The people she's recruiting have been inspired by Luke Skywalker, but she isn't sure if she should reveal the truth about him (that he essentially gave up on restoring the Jedi Order after the ""birth"" of Kylo Ren).  Luke, heeding Yoda's words, eventually does this himself.  He shows up and discusses his past failures with the new Jedi so they can learn from his mistakes.  And then he promises to help Rey guide this new Jedi Order.

Kylo Ren: His unstable leadership is causing the First Order to crumble around him.  His lust for power has left him broken and alone, and now he's not even sure that he can keep his throne from his ambitious underlings.

Finn: He's attempting to lead a rebellion from within the First Order.  Several other former Stormtroopers have been able to break their conditioning (like how Finn did in TFA), and now they want to turn Kylo's army against him.

Poe: He is leading the Resistance now that Leia has passed.  He's attempting to unite the Republican worlds (currently under occupation) who want to fight back against the First Order.

All of this would culminate in the war to end all wars.  Poe would be leading the Resistance Fleet (consisting of various Republican planetary defense forces) against the First Order Fleet, while Finn turns the First Order Army against General Hux.  On Mustafar (Kylo's seat of power), Rey and her Jedi will take on Kylo and the Knights of Ren.

When the battle is won for the good guys, Rey offers Kylo Ren mercy, but he refuses.  He says he doesn't deserve it, and he's left to die.  In the end, we find out that Kylo has survived.

2. Ewoks. The Ewoks on Endor should've been Wookiees on Kashyyk. Enough said. 

3. This is a major one but there shouldn't have really been a Death Star II. Kashyyk could've had a shield generator for the Imperial home base (maybe Naboo?) With the rebels infiltrating and taking the heart of the Empire. Rehashing ANH doesn't work when ANH is part of the trilogy.

Star Wars live action TV show will face a lot of ill-founded criticism and prejudice.,"Imagine how much attention will be focused on the debut of the first live action Star Wars TV show ever. The premiere episode will break all the records by viewership count. It won't be just highly anticipated project, it will be the very first serialized live action Star Wars story on the small screen. The only chance Disney will have to leave the first impression. There will be a lot of challenges for it to overcome. I think that not all of those challenges will be fair.

Despite TV show will obviously be different from movie, many folks want exactly that. A long Star Wars movie with frequent lightsaber duels and space battles. There are some aspects that unlike films no TV show will ever have. With smaller budget and longer screen time the ratio of big impressive action scenes per hour will be lower. It is inevitable flaw that has to be compensated by other well executed details. It seems obvious, but some portion of viewers still will have false expectations.

General audience wishes to see a Jedi protagonists right from the get-go. Movies can transform the main character into a Jedi knight in two hours. TV shows will likely stretch that transformation across the course of a season. Audience is learning about the fiction world along with heroes and heroines like Luke or Rey. We identify ourselves with them. A common role of a farmer or scavenger is easier to get used to. The first part of their story, when they don't posses any supernatural powers, is as important as their journey after they learn about the Force. A quick obtaining of those knowledge will also look cheap and undeserved. The only two options to have a Jedi from the start of the TV show is either to have one as a supporting character or tell the backstory in a form of flashbacks.

All modern SW canon is set in a single continuity. It's all connected. Both animated series were able to feature cartoony version of famous characters. Movies like “Rogue One” had cameos from Leia and Tarkin due to expensive CGI. TV show won't have that luxury. There won't be many familiar elements for some viewers to believe that it is indeed connected.

P.S: This whole post is nothing more than my speculative opinion. I don't claim to be right. I just express what I think will happen when that TV show will debut. ",StarWars,True,1520187088,2018-03-04

So what do you think Bothans should look like in the NEU?,"So far the NEU has placed a cease and desist  order on Bothans. In Legends Bothans played a huge role in post RotJ politics and the war against the Empire. Yet they have yet to appear in anything out side the RotJ movie and a one line passing sentence in Bloodline. 

In fact Pablo has said and been backed up by others like John Jackson Miller and Timothy Zhan that writers in books and comics have been disallowed from using them. They apparently want the design to come from in house. So instead of using the images we have been used to for 20 years they will look like something different. 

Now the one line we get about them in Bloodline is ""a group of Bothans growling to one another in front of one office’s door"" which means they might still share some animal traits. 

But I was thinking if you could design the new bothans what would they look like. Because as some mention the Bothans are great spies but they would stand out starkly on any imperial world. 

So should they be more like the Zeltrons and Faleen? Near humans who are considered attractive by humans with the added benefit of having pheromones that makes people want to trust them.

OR should they be more like the Defel, a more animalistic looking species with the ability to be nearly invisible in shadows?

Or something completely different? The growling line makes it seem like they will fit more with the Defel and old space goat depiction but that could always change. ",StarWars,True,1520187514,2018-03-04

Midi-Chlorian Testing for Sports,"So as we know, Force sensitives have a multitude of advantages over regular people when it comes to reflexes, stamina, dexterity and pure athleticism. Example being Anakin being able to be the only human to podrace at all and he even won. His reflexes are extremely heightened. 

Now we know Tatooine is lawless and cheaters are common like Sebulba so I wouldn’t expect Midi-Chlorian testing done there. But on more regulated and well respected sports leagues you’d think Midi-Chlorian testing would be common. 

Force sensitives are rare, in a galaxy with quadrillions of people Force sensitives can’t range much more than a few million from what we have seen. This leads me to believe that a sports athlete with Force sensitivity would have an extremely unfair advantage over others, similar to PED and HGH in real life

This is why I’d think people would have their Midi-Chlorian count tested when they go into sports because it wouldn’t be fair to the other competitors. I don’t if any sports in Star Wars have been covered other than Pod racing but imagine playing basketball and slighting adjusting the ball to make sure your shot goes in or playing football and using the force to trip a guy to get the tackle etc. 

So what do you all think about Midi-Chlorian testing for sports?",StarWars,True,1520189434,2018-03-04

What is your favorite “unlikely pairing”?,"I was reading today about what happened to Mother Talzin post-TCW.

I was surprised to see that Sidious himself travelled with General Grievous to Dathomir to combat Talzin and Maul. I was also taken aback that Grievous was the one to actually kill Talzin. 

That just seemed like a really cool and unusual pairing, since Sidious only rarely directly intervened and I believe only spoke to Grievous one time via hologram in ROTS and never throughout TCW(?)

[SPOILERS] I heavily dislike what they did to Luke.,"First things first I like TLJ. It's not a bad movie and has some really good scenes but I hate how they did Luke. They barely covered any ground with him and he died in quite possibly the lamest way possible. Obi-Wan died fighting Vader and had a badass line before he went down, Yoda was old and shared his wisdom before he died, and Luke....faded away. It just felt so pointless. He projected himself so he would be away from the actual fight but then he still died? Like, what? They should have had Luke be in TFA so we got more things explained and give his death some weight/purpose.

Yes, I know the reason he did it so he could be a ""legend"" but he could have done it without dying. I just feel like he should have died at the end of the trilogy instead of halfway through OR introduced him earlier.",StarWars,True,1520198607,2018-03-04

The biggest coincidence in Star Wars?,"Sure, it's easy to say ""the Force did it."" Star Wars will always one of the best built in explanations.

But what do you think is the most coincidental event in Star Wars? That one thing with the highest odds against it occurring that it pretty much must have required intervention of the Force to happen the way it did. 

For me, it's always been Luke and Dagobah. All he has to go on is the name of *a planet* and he manages to crash within walking distance of his destination! 

On a side note too, I also always thought it was pretty funny how he's ostensibly one of the best pilots in the galaxy and he basically just flies a starfighter directly into a swamp, no fly over to try to locate a suitable place to land, just straight through the fog, through some vines and *splash*. 

Don't take this as criticism though. Luke's time with Yoda is as sacred to me as anything fictional can be.

Luke was right on all counts. He knows what people will do before they do it. I think he's the very definition of reliable narrator, so it is bizarre to me that people have presumed that Rey is right and Luke is wrong about Kylo. Pretty much every main character except for Luke in the OT and ST have misplaced their trust at least once, and Rey isn't exactly a reliable person either. She can't even be honest with herself about her abandonment and she tends to believe whatever she prefers to be true. I'm not going to trust Reys word over Lukes, especially not after her attempts at turning Kylo to the light backfired and only made him angrier than ever.

Today I was at my parent’s house and not only did they still have the cards, but these “rare” cards were still at their house - organized and in protective sleeves. Wow.

What do you want to see happen to Kylo Ren in the end? [TLJ Spoilers],"So it's a pretty common theme for the movies that a bad guy sticks around for a couple movies, maybe rides out a story. Vader survived 3 movies and Sidious managed to survive the first 6, but otherwise the big bads have only lasted 1 or 2 movies at max.

Kylo Ren, filling the role of Vader, is moving on to his third movie in the trilogy that will presumably wrap up the First Order Story Arch. So what should happen to Kylo Ren ultimately?

As we saw in TLJ, Rey made a strong play to talking Kylo Ren back to the light side and the whole portrayal of Luke vs. Ben Solo in the flashback tries really hard to cast Ren in a more favorable light, but we also see how he used Rey to his own purpose and attempted to dispose of the Rebels after taking the First Order for himself.

Do you believe he's still redeemable? Do you even want him to be brought back to the light? Should he be killed off and forgotten about?

Personally, I see Kylo Ren as being one of the key members in the casting Trio alongside Finn and Rey. They're the new faces of the series that, through Disney, is excepted to have a much more active life than it did trapped under Lucas's care. I don't think killing off a character like Kylo Ren is a viable option at this point, but I also don't know if he's a character that can or needs to be brought back to the good guys either.

I've had a thought that, moving forward, the whole plot of Rebel/Resistance versus Empire/First Order has to end and move on to a different focus, perhaps moving into a familiar environment like the Yuuzhan Vong invasion or perhaps something new altogether. With Kylo Ren, though, I see the opportunity to see a middle ground antagonist, somebody who challenges Rey as they both continue to grow, but doesn't have the express desire to kill her or aid whatever the running threat of the movie is. Almost similar to Loki's role in the Marvel universe, though obviously done in it's own unique way appropriate to Star Wars style. Darth Bane comes to mind when I think about what I want to see happen.",StarWars,True,1520215819,2018-03-04

"i wrote my own version of episode 1. it’s rlly long but for the two of u that do read it, i hope u like it. i hav revises &amp; edited it none so i’m sorry for any errors (grammatical, or plot wise)","the film opens with jedi knight obi wan kenobi and his padawan anakin skywalker on route to the trade federation’s space station to discuss a compromise to get rid of a blockade on the pacifist planet alderaan. they get there and obi wan asks anakin if he senses anything and anakin says no. obi wan says he does and he has a bad feeling about this. anakin simply tells him to be patient because if there truly is any danger, it will reveal itself, and they are jedi knights and can handle a few trade federation battle droids. obi wan tells anakin not to be so arrogant because a jedi is always humble. a protocol droid enters and gives them their food and then leaves. we cut to that same droid telling the viceroys that it thinks the diplomats sent are jedi knights, because it saw lightsabers on their waist. nute gunray begins to panic. the hologram next to him, which has a mysterious hooded figure projected, says not to panic because two Jedi are no threat to a sith lord, and he will send his apprentice to dispose of them. for now, test them with a few battle droids. 

while obi wan and anakin sit and wait, they continue to talk about anakin soon passing his jedi trials. obi wan says he knows anakin has failed them two times before but that it is simply because they hold anakin to a much higher standard than the other padawans. anakin says he’s aware, he’s just a little embarrassed, because he’s supposed to be so powerful yet he can’t pass trials that most padawans pass on their first try. obi wan begins to tell anakin to be patient but stops when he senses something. anakin says he senses something too and immediately the two stand and draw their lightsabers, right when the door opens to reveal two battle droids. they destroy the droids and suddenly become surrounded by them. they fight their way through the station until they find an escape pod. they are shot onto the planet of alderaan. 

they land on alderaan and after doing some scouting, they realize that the planet seems to be overrun by clones of the weequay species. they continue sneaking through the streets of alderaan until eventually they hear a group of clones running through the street, and an echo-y voice shouting “HELP!!!” obi wan runs to see who or what it is and they see a silver C3 protocol droid running from the soldiers. anakin and obi wan spring into action and fight off all of the soldiers. they look at the droid and ask what that was about, and he responds “I am C3! Human cyborg relations! It appears you have saved my life!” anakin cuts him off and tells obi wan that he senses more soldiers coming. obi wan agrees and asks c3 why those soldiers were chasing him. he says that he is the queen’s protocol droid, so when these soldiers took over, they kidnapped the queen, all of her servants &amp; handmaidens, and killed all of her royal guards but one. he barely got away, and they tracked him down in hopes that he’d retained information in his time with the queen, because she refused to give any. 

obi wan says that he senses a sinister plot that the trade federation was attempting to cover with their blockade. he attempts to call the republic, only to discover that all communications have been jammed. anakin asks c3 where they’re holding the queen and c3 tells him that the queen is being held in her palace and they refuse to let her leave. anakin says they aren’t leaving the planet without her, and even though obi wan tries to object, anakin is much too headstrong to listen. they sneak through the streets of alderaan and eventually see a group of soldiers escorting one of the queen’s royal guards and a handmaiden. c3 tells obi wan who they are and right when obi wan begins to devise a plan of attack, anakin swoops in and begins fighting the clones. after defeating the clones, anakin asks what the guard’s name is and he says it’s rex. he says that when the clones raided the castle, they killed all of the queen’s guards and kidnapped and tortured him for days. 

the handmaiden, padmé, begs that they save the queen before they leave because the jedi are her only hope. obi wan says he agrees that they should save the queen, and asks them if they can get in. rex says he knows the castle like the back of his hand and knows every back entrance there is. anakin asks where the best one is, and rex responds “well, sir, i don’t think you’ll like that part.” 

we cut to them walking through the sewers and obi wan is complaining, while anakin and padmé make jokes at obi wan’s expense. they bond through these jokes and obi wan sarcastically says he’s glad they’re having a good time, but he’s ready to be back on coruscant. rex says that he loves coruscant and has always wanted to be a member of the republic’s elite stormtrooper army, but that right now, he owes it to the queen to stick around. obi wan says he’ll put in a good word for rex, because it’s that kind of dedication and loyalty that the republic needs. rex says he’s honored to hear that come from a jedi. padmé then says she wasn’t even sure if the jedi actually exist, because they work in such secrecy. obi wan says “yes, well, we are peace keepers, not politicians or celebrities.” padmé says they still deserve recognition and obi wan says they don’t seek recognition or fame or fortune or power. all they seek is balance. rex says they’ve reached the entrance. 

obi wan asks how they plan to get to the top and rex says there’s an elevator nearby, they just have to get to it. c3 tells them that the odds of them making it to that elevator without being killed or taken prisoner are exactly two hundred to one. rex looks at him and says “C, we talked about this.” defeated, c3 says “don’t tell you the odds.. yes.. sir.” rex smiles and says “good boy.” they open the door and walk into the castle, as a pair of soldiers walk past them. they sneak their way over to the elevator, using many force tricks, really showing how well obi wan and anakin work together in situations like this. eventually, they make it to the elevator, and start riding it up. when they get in, anakin says “well, that was easy enough, master.” right when he says that, the elevator abruptly stops and obi wan says “you just had to say it, didn’t you?” 

the elevator doors open to reveal about twelve clones, all aiming blasters at them. the clones tell them to drop any weapons, and put their hands up. obi wan and anakin look at each other and almost immediately respond by force pushing the leader through the rest of them. they draw their lightsabers, and engage in a battle with the soldiers. soon, others join, and we are thrown into an epic battle between the clones and our five protagonists. obi wan and anakin use their lightsabers and the force. rex uses his duel wielded blaster pistols. padmé begs rex to give her one, so she can fight, and rex refuses and tells her to stay in cover. c3 panics. they fight their way through, all the way to the top. they retrieve the queen and the queen tells them that two of her royal ships are on top of the palace, they just have to get to the roof. they fight their way up, and narrowly escape. 

we now cut to a different planet - coruscant. on this planet, we see the hooded figure from before standing, looking out at the landscape of the planet. suddenly, another hooded figure appears - darth maul. darth maul says that the jedi escaped, and the hooded figure - darth sidious - says good, and that his plan is going exactly as expected. the next phase begins. maul asks what lord sidious’ bidding is, and sidious responds “patience, my apprentice. your role will come soon enough.” 

cut back to the ship, where everyone is. anakin and padmé are sitting at a table playing the same game we saw played in episode iv. as they play the game, they talk about their lives. padmé says she was born and raised on alderaan, and that at a very young age, she was chosen by queen amidalla to be a handmaiden. anakin says that he was inducted into the jedi order at the age of five, when obi wan freed him. padmé asks what he means by ‘freed,’ and anakin responds that he was born into slavery, owned by a toydarian named waddo. padmé, surprised, exclaims “you’re a slave?” anakin seems offended. “i’m a person,” he says. “i was a slave. now i’m a jedi. and one day, i will be the most powerful jedi of them all.” padmé says she meant nothing by it, to which anakin responds “no, im sure you didn’t.”

we now see obi wan and rex’s conversation. obi wan comments on how it seems the handmaiden and anakin get along quite well, and rex responds that that handmaiden has always been quite feisty. obi wan says it seems anakin has taken a liking to her and rex says “i heard that was forbidden for jedi. is that a myth?” and obi wan says it is forbidden, but anakin’s young and it’s good for him to experience these feelings as long as he doesn’t act on them or allow them to interfere with his training. 

they arrive on coruscant and are met by senator palpatine. palpatine shakes all of their hands except anakin’s, who he takes into a warm embrace. the senator looks at both anakin and obi wan and tells them that the council would like to meet with them. after this, the senator approaches the queen and tells her he is so sorry for the trouble she went through. 

we cut to the council where all the jedi are seated. obi wan and anakin stand in the middle of the room. we catch obi wan in the middle of his summary about what happened on alderaan and how he believes there is a sinister plot going on. master yoda says that he agrees, but before the jedi can even begin to thing about interfering, they have to first be let known if the republic wants to do anything. anakin, being a little too bold, shouts that he doesn’t believe the jedi should wait, and if they are the peace keepers they claim to be, then they shouldn’t sit by and let this happen. jedi master mace windu interjects and says that skywalker has forgotten his place. anakin simply steps back and apologizes. jedi master qui gon jinn says that anakin is confusing peacekeeper with soldier, and that he must be patient, for jedi don’t rush into every battle offered to them. jedi master plo koon then says those who do not pick their battles are bound to end up in a losing one. kit fisto then speaks up and says that while the boy’s methods are misguided, his ideology isn’t. they are indeed keepers of the peace, so they should at least attempt to influence the republic to help protect these people. ki-adi-mundi says he agrees. after these two interject, we see anakin’s face turn from embarrassment to a hint of pride. qui gon interjects - “perhaps the boy does have a point. it would be wrong for us to let these people suffer. it’s not the jedi way.” mace reluctantly agrees and says that he’ll send qui gon to speak with chancellor velorum about possibly trying to help. 

cut to the jedi walking out, and obi wan is walking with qui gon and they’re talking, laughing like good friends. qui gon says that the situation on alderaan does seem very troubling, but as long as they keep it contained, it hopefully will be a small conflict and won’t result in any war. obi wan says he agrees. he says that from what he saw, though, the trade federation has an entire clone army, much bigger than their small army of droids that they use for protection. qui gon says that he doesn’t believe the trade federation is smart enough to organize a plot like this. obi wan asks if he believes someone else is behind this. qui gon says yes, and that whatever it is, obi wan and his padawan will be with him when he gets to the bottom of it, and that he will be sure of. obi wan and qui gon say goodbye, and anakin begins to walk away. obi wan asks anakin where he’s going and anakin says he wants to go speak to senator palpatine. 

cut to senator palpatine’s office, where anakin sits in a chair, levitating a small ball with the force. he displays a certain aura of comfortability in the presence of palpatine. palpatine tells anakin that he’s so glad he’s okay because he wouldn’t know what to do if his favorite jedi knight had been killed. anakin laughs and says “well, not quite a jedi knight.” palpatine tells anakin not to speak down on himself because he has a feeling the next time anakin takes the trials, he will succeed. anakin simply says “maybe.” palpatine, who senses anakin’s doubt, walks over to anakin and says “anakin.. i have known you since you were just a youngling. i have never seen a more gifted padawan, and trust me. one of these days, you will be the most powerful jedi on the council. even more powerful than master yoda.” we see anakin’s face turn from a hint of doubt to an overwhelming sense of reassurance. palpatine turns around and says “so... tell me about this handmaiden.” anakin’s face now turns to confusion. “what about her?” he asks, defensively. palpatine jokes and says obi wan has already told him about how smitten anakin is, and anakin says he feels no emotion for her, and that it’s against the jedi code to even think of such a thing. palpatine laughs and tells anakin that it’s okay to feel. he then goes on to tell anakin that anakin’s feelings are what makes him stronger than the other jedi. anakin relaxes and begins telling palpatine about padmé and how they got along but he thinks he really messed up with her when he got defensive about slavery. palpatine tells anakin that not everyone has shared his experiences so they can’t all relate, and that he’s sure padmé meant nothing by it. palpatine gives anakin a stern, but fatherly look and says “she’s apologized. maybe you should, too.” anakin nods and palpatine says that he has to go speak with chancellor velorum about the hearing, and that anakin should work on finding a way to apologize to padmé. 

now cut to obi wan kenobi and qui gon jinn speaking to chancellor velorum about the jedi aiding the fight in alderaan. the chancellor is hesitant at first, because he doesn’t trust the jedi as soldiers but palpatine walks in and begins fighting for the jedi’s case. eventually, velorum gives in and says he’ll allow the jedi to help. 

cut now to anakin walking over to a large door and it opens. the queen of alderaan answers and anakin presents her a homemade necklace. he says he wants to see padme so he can give it to her in person as an apology for how he acted. the queen says padmé is running an errand but she’ll be sure she gets it. 

now we cut to the senate all discussing this blockade. chancellor velorum elaborates on the issue and everything goes really similar to the original film, all the way down to velorum being replaced by palpatine, and they decide to have the jedi aid in the battle. 

the queen flies back to alderaan with jedi knights obi wan kenobi and qui gon jinn. on the ship, we see qui gon bonding with obi wan and the scene goes on for a few minutes so we can really connect with qui gon. they speak of their times training under the tutelage of master yoda together, and tell stories of what they’ve been up to for the past couple of years. we even learn that qui gon was also there when anakin was discovered on tatooine. we really see how close these two are as friends. the ship lands and they exit. queen amidalla says there are native gungans that they can contact in hopes to create an army. qui gon tells her to lead the way. 

cut to later when a submarine comes out of water. the queen, padmé, qui gon, obi wan, and a few stormtroopers wait on land. two stormtroopers get out of the water and say that the underwater gungan city has been completely abandoned. the queen is confused and says that the clones must’ve found their home, because the gungans never leave home unless they’re- 

before she can finish, arrows come down, one of them hitting a stormtrooper, killing him. all around them, gungans drop onto land, pointing their bows at all of them. this altercation is one that does not necessarily go the exact same, but still has the end goal as the original version of episode i. take out all of the childish humor, and keep in a good bit of hostility and suspense that at any moment, the gungans could open fire and start a shootout. they’re portrayed as warriors not children. the scene goes almost exactly the same, all the way down to padmé revealing she’s the queen and the gungans agreeing to fight. 

cut back to the chancellor palpatine’s office where mace windu, yoda, and anakin skywalker are. in the middle of the room is a hologram of qui gon and obi wan, telling them that they have the gungans on their side and all they need is for the navy to be prepared to come in and bring them supplies. anakin chimes in and says he thinks he should lead the navy. obi wan is very protective at first and refuses, saying that anakin isn’t prepared for that, but anakin says he’s a better pilot than any of the stormtroopers, and can lead them. he says it’s not an actual battle, simply a relief mission, and he’s more than capable of sneaking past the clone forces. palpatine says “well, i think padawan skywalker is more than qualified, and it is i who has final say in such a matter.” mace tries to object, but palpatine is much too persistent and declares that anakin will lead them into battle. 

cut to a dark chamber. darth maul walks in and kneels. a hologram of darth sidious comes up. “what is your bidding?” maul asks. “the time has come,” says sidious. “i want you to lead the clone navy into battle.” “would that be all, my lord?” “the republic navy will be led by a young padawan by the name of anakin skywalker. see to it that he’s dead.”

cut to anakin skywalker preparing his ship. palpatine comes up behind him and introduces anakin to an r2d2 unit. he tells anakin that the droid will be aiding him in his assault and then introduces someone else - a new stormtrooper. “i’m sure you and private rex have become well acquainted.” anakin smiles and shakes his hand. “welcome to the team,” he says. they get on board the ship and a john williams score begins to swell. they launch into space. 

inside the ship, we see anakin looking out at the hyper space, mentally preparing himself. his admiral approaches him, and greets him. he tells him that his name is tarkan and he will be aiding him today. anakin tells him it’s nice to meet him. tarkin begins telling anakin that reportedly a providence class dreadnought in the blockade around alderaan, and its the same one that members of the republic’s navy have been telling stories about. “stories?” anakin asks. tarkin tells anakin that this dreadnought has one of the most deadly tacticians the republic has ever seen. he picks off fighter pilots before they even know he’s there. he’s able to dodge blaster fire from all sides at ease. they say even the deadliest pirates on kessel feared this pilot. anakin smiles and says “well then it looks like we’re going to have some fun, doesn’t it?”

cut to obi wan, qui gon, and padmé all walking through a war trench created on the streets of alderaan. a man dressed in all blue walks out and hugs padmé. “my queen,” he says. “i’m so glad you’re okay.” he lets her go and looks at obi wan and qui gon. he introduces himself as senator bail organa of alderaan and says he’s been doing all he can with the small amount of resources given, but that they are just no match for the clone troopers. qui gon says there’s a squadron of stormtroopers with many supplies in bound, and that they’ve convinced the gungans to also aid in the battle. bail asks what they plan to do about the blockade above alderaan and obi wan says that once the battle begins, they will call in the republic navy, but for now they just need to focus on getting as many supplies as possible down here. bail seems hesitant but says he’s choosing to trust the jedi. qui gon thanks him and insists that the force is on their side in this battle. obi wan’s hologram begins to ring, and he steps to the side. he takes it off of his belt and opens it. a small hologram of anakin comes up. anakin tells obi wan that they are approaching the blockade and then says that there’s apparently a republic navy myth anakin has to watch out for. obi wan says that sounds like a force user and anakin says that’s impossible because no jedi would ever turn on the order and the sith have been dead for over a thousand years. obi wan seems confused, but tells anakin to just be careful. “of course, master.” 

cut to above alderaan inside anakin’s ship. anakin tells the troopers to cloak the ship and they do. they begin to slide past the dreadnought and anakin begins to smile. his plan is working. “it seems like the cloaking device is working,” he says. tarkin seems more hesitant. “for now... but you get any closer, and they won’t need to detect us.” “you worry too much.”

cut to aboard the dreadnought where darth maul sits in the commander’s chair. one of the clones approaches him and asks if maul wants the clone to send out a scout to try and find the padawan’s ship. “no...” maul says. “he’s... close. i sense him. where are you, padawan?” cut back to anakin slipping past the dreadnought. cut back to maul. back to anakin. back to maul. maul tells the clone to send a bombing squadron to the surface of alderaan. “i will draw him out.” 

the bombing squadron is deployed. inside anakin’s ship, rex yells “they’ve unleashed a bombing squadron, sir!” anakin tells them to cut all engines. tarkin, angrily, shouts “what are you doing?!” “i can’t risk them detecting us.” there is no music. the scene is completely quiet, and all we can hear is the silence of space and the radar in the ship. it beeps. “2,000 feet out,” rex says. it beeps again. “1,000.” again. “500.” “they’re going to hit us!” tarkin yells. it beeps one more time. “100.” the squadron passes over anakin’s ship, and goes down to alderaan. cut down to alderaan where bail organa is talking to padmé and the two jedi knights. the squadron comes down and begins bombing. they all take cover.

cut back to anakin. “he’s going to bomb alderaan until it’s nothing but ashes,” anakin says. “men, turn this ship around.” the engines are turned back on and the ship is turned completely around until anakin is staring at the dreadnought. a hologram of obi wan comes up. “master,” anakin says, “i’m taking on the dreadnought, i can’t let the bombing continue.” “no,” obi wan says, “anakin, stick with the mission. are you listening to me? stick with the–“ anakin crushes his hologram. rex whispers to a trooper next to him. “i thought we were on a relief mission.” the trooper next to him responds with “you learn pretty quickly that with skywalker, you’re always on the offensive.” 

the ship decloaks and anakin screams “FIRE!” they fire two missiles, however both fall short when they are stopped by the dreadnought’s shields. cut to inside the dreadnought where maul screams for the clones to fire at the ship. anakin recloaks the ship, and manages to dodge the missiles. inside the dreadnought, maul begins laughing maniacally. he sends out a squadron of ships to fire in all directions anakin may have been able to go. cut to inside anakin’s ship. the blaster fire comes from all angles, and it’s a riveting scene showing anakin barely managing to escape it. cut to inside the dreadnought. a clone approaches maul. “sir... i don’t know how but he managed to escape our fighters.” 

maul smiles. “i know how... it’s the jedi.” cut to alderaan where obi wan is trying relentlessly to get in touch with anakin. qui gon steps behind him and tells him not too worry so much, because he has to let his padawan forge his own path. obi wan laughs and says it’s strange hearing qui gon so adamant about the jedi code, due to his tendency to bend rules. qui gon says it’s not about the jedi code, but about the living force, and its will. obi wan reluctantly agrees. 

cut back to anakin in his ship. he walks through, inspecting his troopers, making sure they’re all ready for battle. “i want us decloaked in the next ten seconds!” tarkan screams at anakin and calls him a madman who is only going to get them killed. anakin’s face is determined, and he’s clearly not wavering. a john williams score swells in the background. we cut to maul staring at his radar. “where are you, child?” he says to himself. cut back to anakin as he screams “DECLOAK!” the ship decloaks and two missiles are fired. they hit the shields. four missiles are fired back at them. “cloak!” tarkan yells, “do it now!” “no,” anakin says. tarkan yells at anakin, asking what he’s doing, and anakin tells the troopers to enact evasive maneuvers. they begin flying through space, trying their best to dodge the heat seeking missiles. anakin tells a trooper to move and begins to fly the ship himself and we see how skilled of a pilot anakin really is. he dodges the missiles. two of them crash into each other exploding, and anakin is now flying straight toward the dreadnought. “skywalker!” tarkan yells. “what are you doing?!” cut to inside the dreadnought. maul screams at the clones to get the shields up, but the clones say that they aren’t fully recharged yet. cut back to anakin, smiling. “how’s this for a myth?” he says. he barely misses the dreadnought, both ships scraping against each other, sparks flying all over the place. cut to inside the dreadnought as the ship shakes and everyone is sent flying across it. cut to outside and as anakin’s ship disconnects with the dreadnought, the two remaining missiles fly in, hitting the dreadnought. 

cut down to alderaan as obi wan is talking to qui gon, as they hear a boom in the sky. they look up and see an explosion in the distance and then see the dreadnought plummeting down somewhere far away from them. qui gon smiles and says it looks like anakin did it. 

transition to anakin’s ship, along with many fighter pilots of the republic landing. obi wan storms towards anakin, never breaking eye contact. anakin steps off of his ship smiling, but upon seeing obi wan, his smile fades, and turns into a look of worry. “master,” he says. “i know what you said, but as you can see, i–“ obi wan disregards it all and grabs anakin, hugging him tightly, letting out a long breath of relief. he lets anakin out of the hug, but keeps his hands on his shoulders, and gives anakin a truly fatherly look and says “please don’t ever worry me like that again.” anakin smiles and nods. 

padmé walks over to anakin and tells him she’s glad to see he survived. anakin sarcastically says he’s honored that a queen would think so much of his life and she smiles. anakin looks at her neck and notices she’s wearing the necklace that he made her and says “i guess you weren’t too busy, after all.” qui gon walks over to them and says that when the clones are done inspecting the fallen dreadnought, they will begin preparing for battle, so they only have until morning to rest. he recommends setting up camp. 

cut to the jedi temple where we see mace windu and yoda talking to qui gon via hologram. qui gon is explaining to master yoda that anakin successfully took down the mysterious dreadnought, and yoda says that the commander of the ship sounds like a force user. mace asks if yoda thinks it’s possible that a jedi has gone rogue and yoda says perhaps, or perhaps a long dead enemy has risen from the shadows. mace asks if yoda is referencing the sith, and yoda nods. qui gon says that that’s impossible because the jedi vanquished the sith thousands of years ago, but yoda says that the sith have always been crafty, and found ways to survive. he tells qui gon to be careful, because if it truly was a sith lord on the ship, the fight may not be over just yet. the call is ended, and yoda looks at mace and says he senses dark times coming. mace simply says “may the force be with us,” and we cut back to qui gon on alderaan. 

he walks over to a fire that has been set up by obi wan, anakin, padmé, rex, and bail. bail is describing what it was like when the clones took over. he says that they came in and destroyed everything almost instantaneously. it felt like a dream that he had gotten too wrapped up in. while he talks about this, padmé stands up and leaves. anakin gets up and follows her to make sure she’s alright. he catches up with her and asks if everything is okay, and she says yes but he can tell she’s lying. he asks her once more if she’s okay and she turns around and asks him what will happen if they lose tomorrow. anakin says they won’t, and she asks how. he explains to her that when he was little, he grew up on the desert planet of tatooine as a slave and every single day he dreamed of one day escaping that life. one day, two newly knighted jedi landed on the planet, there to negotiate the release of a senator who was being held hostage by the hutt family, the same one that technically owned anakin. long story short, the negotiations went south and the jedi found themselves being hunted by bounty hunters all over the planet, and anakin’s mother let them take refuge in their home, even though she knew that doing so was punishable by execution. his mother simply couldn’t let two strangers in need suffer. and while the jedi were there, they met a five year old anakin. they both sensed the force very strongly in anakin, but it was obi wan who first said anakin may be the chosen one. now, anakin was still just a child, and was growing up in the outer rim, so he didn’t even know what the force was. but they took him to the jedi temple and began his training, and all of this happened, because it was the will of the force. he smiles at padmé and says “it is not the will of the force to let your planet die.” padmé leans in and kisses anakin on the lips. she smiles at him and the scene ends. 

cut to the next morning. the stormtroopers are lined up, prepared for battle and other than the occasional gust of wind, everything is silent. obi wan, qui gon, and anakin all stand, ready to command these soldiers, ready to take on the role of warriors, even though all of them were raised to be peacekeepers. we see rex and padmé standing beside each other, and rex pats her on the shoulder. she looks at him, and he grabs one of his twin pistols, and hands it to her. “be safe,” he says. “i love you.” 

we see the clones marching forward. they stop and now we are left with a shot of stormtroopers and gungans on the right side of the screen, accompanied by a heard of clone soldiers and a eerily empty no man’s land. there is a calm. and then... “CHARGE!” the gungans race forward, and almost instantly, the clones begin shooting, but just as quickly as they pick off the gungans, the stormtroopers shoot them from a distance. the gungans finally make it over to the clones and begin tearing into them mercilessly, firing arrows into them, stabbing them, sometimes just tackling them to the ground and wailing on them. 

the stormtroopers snipe from a far, and the battle goes on for quite some time. we see them all cooperating, fighting a perfectly even battle, until eventually, the clones are closing in, and no longer can the stormtroopers fight this battle from a distance. tarkan walks over to the jedi and tells them to leave with the queen. obi wan refuses, but tarkan says that the jedi are not fit to fight a war, and if the queen dies, this whole battle is pointless. he insists that he can lead these soldiers to victory but the jedi have to do their part and protect the queen. anakin grabs obi wans shoulder and says “master! he’s right.” 

the jedi run, bringing padmé and rex, who refused to leave the queen’s side, trying to make their way through the palace, and to the top so they can get on a ship and leave. they fight their way through several clones, until finally, a door opens, and no clones come out. there before them, they have their first face to face encounter with the sith lord darth maul. he slowly steps forward, and pulls out his lightsaber. he ignites it, one blade at a time, making this the first time the audience ever sees such a lightsaber. anakin looks at padmé and rex and tells them to run, and that the jedi will take care of this. they do as told. all three jedi ignite their lightsabers. obi wan whispers to anakin to be very careful, and anakin smiles and says “surely, he’s no match for three of us.”

the battle ensues, and we get a beautifully choreographed fight between the four of them. the jedi are skilled with their sabers, but they are nothing compared to maul, who is spinning and flipping all over the room. they fight through the castle, intertwined with rex and padmé fight through clones, trying to get to the top of the palace as duel of the fates plays in the background. eventually, the fight reaches a stopping point when qui gon swings his saber at maul. maul ducks, and makes his way to anakin, who despite his efforts, is no match. his hand is sliced off, and he falls to the ground, screaming in pain. obi wan swoops in, angrily, swinging his lightsaber but maul simply blocks it, and kicks obi wan off of the platform they’re all on. obi wan falls at least forty feet onto the platform below and is knocked out upon impact. maul turns around, just barely catching the qui gon’s lightsaber, managing to block it. he does a flip over qui gon and the two stare each other down, and qui gon now knows it is his job to stop this monster. 

cut to padmé and rex, who finally reach the top, only to be stopped by at least twenty clones guarding the ship. the blast several of them down, but both of them know the odds of them getting to that ship are slim. rex looks at her, and takes off his helmet. “looks like it’s me and you, kid.” she smiles and the two rise from their cover and begin firing at the clones. 

cut back to qui gon and darth maul who are fighting viscously, both of them narrowly managing the escape death by the hand of the other. we now cut to obi wan who is laying unconscious on the platform below them. he wakes up, and looks up to see maul and qui gon fighting. he jumps up onto the platform and checks on anakin who has passed out from the pain. he looks forward and sees maul, and knows what he is going to do. he sprints forward, and now the fight begins going much like it did in the original film, starting with the force field keeping maul separated from everybody, all the way down to maul killing qui gon and eventually being cut in half. 

cut back to padmé &amp; rex who have barely managed to take out all of the clones. they board the ship and rex tries to turn it on but realizes that the clones have reprogrammed it after they stole the last one. padmé looks outside and sees more clones arriving on the roof. she asks rex if he can get the ship on and rex says yes, but it’s going to take some time. “say no more,” she says. she runs to battle with the clones to buy rex time. 

cut back to obi wan who at this point has run over to anakin to check on him. obi wan is almost in tears. his best friend has just been slain in front of him, an evil that he thought was dead has returned, and now the boy he sees as a son could die if he doesn’t receive medical attention. everything is spinning around him. he manages to wake anakin up, and begins reassuring him that everything will be okay. anakin can barely breathe he’s in so much pain. anakin asks obi wan if the sith got away and obi wan says no. he tells anakin not to strain himself, to try to remain quiet, that he’s going to get them out of this. 

cut back to padmé fighting off the clones, while rex works on the ship. finally, rex screams. “I GOT IT!” padmé takes down one final clone, and runs on board the ship. the ship begins taking off. cut to obi wan carrying anakin on his shoulder, opening a door leading to a balcony. he looks up and sees the ship. he waves his hand in hopes that they will see him but they clearly don’t. we see anakin on obi wan’s shoulder, barely conscious. he closes his eyes and uses all the life left in him to focus. cut to padmé on board the ship. she looks out the window and sees them. “rex,” she says. “rex, stop, stop, stop NOW! right there, go down there!” rex flies down and rescues them. 

cut now to the jedi temple. obi wan stands, surrounded by his fellow jedi. he recounts the story of the sith lord that they encountered and finishes his story with “it is for those reasons that i must come to the conclusion that the sith, or at least, an attempt to emulate the sith, have returned. i regret to report that fellow jedi knight, qui gon jinn, was killed in battle, and that my padawan, anakin skywalker’s status is still unknown at this point.” the room is silent, until yoda finally speaks up and says that he thanks obi wan for speaking. he asks everyone to leave, and all of the jedi begin to walk out. as they leave, he tells obi wan to stay. 

obi wan turns around and asks yoda what is it. yoda tells obi wan that his padawan will be alright and obi wan asks how he knows. “clouded, your padawans future is,” he says. “but, trust in the force, i do. trust in YOU i do. if your padawan is indeed who the prophecy speaks of, then alive, he is.” obi wan asks what they are to do about the sith lord and yoda says now all they can do is wait. confused, obi wan exclaims “wait?!” “dark times are coming, obi wan. trust in the force, we must, for whether we like it or not, here, the dark times are. the clone war has begun.” credits.

Luke's Return and Tying it All Together,"Not a theory or speculation, but just a hope for Episode IX and restoring the mystery and underlying prophecies surrounding the Force. 

We know Rey has the ancient Jedi texts, and we know they pretty much have to include Maz Kanata in the last film, since her last appearance was well...a hologram broadcast. So my far-reaching hope is that they include a simple thing underlying all films which has never been fully recited in the series: The Jedi Code. 

Maz (being best utilized as an oracle or mystic in the films) teaches Rey to read and understand the texts, and at a critical moment, or maybe one of just despair, she is reciting the last few lines as a means of reaching out to the Force: ""...there is no passion, there is serenity. There is no chaos, there is harmony. There is no death...""

Luke: ""There is the Force.""

And then together, united in a spark of revival for the Jedi Order, they overwhelm...well, whatever would be best implemented there. A natural adversary or a personal one. That's just a hope of how MAYBE they can redeem an underlying sense of prophecy or mysticism to the Skywalker name, and the Force, respectively. ",StarWars,True,1520217689,2018-03-04

Ezra’s Place in the Saga,"After Wolves and a Door and A World Between Worlds, Star Wars now contains full, Force-based justification for Ezra to exist in the same timeline as Luke. I know some fan complaints have centered on Ezra’s growth in power when the son of Skywalker hasn’t even stopped bulls-eyeing womp rats onTatooine yet.

Luke’s connection to the saga is his relationship with Darth Vader. Ezra’s connection is the true nature of his home planet. Lothal is not just any spot in the galaxy. It’s not even just a spot with a Jedi Temple. Now, we all have been let in on the secret, and the Emperor’s pursuit of the portal seems like perfect justification for the development of a young Jedi from Lothal to be the guardian of such knowledge. Dark rises, and light to meet it. 

This might be my favorite takeaway from these episodes. Reading the books and comics taught me that Palpatine is always after any advantage or increase in power. His plans were never limited to Vader and the Death Star. This shows that there’s a place in the galaxy for other heroes not named Skywalker to thwart those machinations.

Your favourite Star Wars moment?,"I believe Star Wars has some of the most magical and cinematic moments of any saga of films. We all know the usual suspects -“No, I am your father” and my personal favourite - Yoda dredging Luke’s X-Wing out of the swamps of Dagobah.

But what are some of the more unusual picks? What’s one you’d like to shine a light on? A potential moment many of us may not appreciate as much as the classics?

I painstakingly worked on a video about why you should rewatch TPM (YouTube - wenbilson - or search my Reddit account for the video) because it has one of the most brilliant moments of character building for Anakin - “I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the slaves” this highlights his character in TPM perfectly and frames his fall to becoming Darth Vader in a very dramatic and effective way. I think it’s a great Star Wars Moment.

[Spoilers] Possible explanation for some controversial plot decisions in TLJ,"Apologies in advance for any formatting errors.

So obviously there were a lot of people who were unhappy with TLJ, many of them citing plot points in the conflict between Admiral Holdo and Poe. I have an idea that this isn't just neglect or oversight on the part of the writers, but rather by design. Much of the events in the film only happen because Holdo (seemingly for no reason) withholds information about the secret rebel base and their plan to survive. This angers Poe, causing him to send Fin and Rose on a rouge mission, and eventually starting a mutiny against Holdo.

Now imagine there is a reason for Holdo not to tell anyone of their plan, and also imagine a reason that it wasn't revealed in the film. The fans are suddenly in the same position as Poe, questioning the decisions because they don't to blindly believe in what they're told. I think episode IX will offer an explanation for Holdo's previously unexplained secrecy (personally I think there's a spy among the rebels, but I don't have any basis for it), and complete the analogy between Poe vs Holdo, and the fans vs the writers, because like Holdo, the creative team isn't afraid of taking criticism and making sacrifices for their ideas.

"As we are coming to the end, I would like to thank Dave Filoni, Pablo Hidalgo and everyone else for their amazing work on Rebels","We've come a long way since the Clone Wars, haven't we? And it all is coming to a close, at least for now. 

I want to thank everyone who worked on TCW and Rebels for their outstanding work on both series, making without a doubt one of the best parts of Star Wars. Seriously, both TCW and Rebels are one of the best media to come out of the franchise. The finale without a doubt will be both emotional and memorable. And probably leave us a little empty inside. But I'm not sad that it's ending, but happy that it happened.

I sincerely wish the best to Dave and Pablo and hope we will see them again helm a Star Wars related project in the future. ",StarWars,True,1520239572,2018-03-05
An event from the Knights of the Old Republic comic series that set a precedent in The Last Jedi,"Spoilers for the early issues of this comics series and The Last Jedi.

John Jackson Miller's Knights of the Old Republic series, set maybe a decade before the game, follows Zayne Carrick, a Padawan on Taris who arrives late to his knighthood ceremony only to discover his four fellow Padawans dead at the feat of their masters. After some investigation Zayne discovers why his friends were murdered, those Jedi masters had a vision which they falsely interpreted, that one of their Padawans would turn to the dark side and bring the galaxy to it's knees. They decided to act first by killing their Padawans, with Zayne only surviving because of his lateness. Of course the prophecy still came true, indirectly because of the Master's actions all but one of them died in the course of the series, with the rest of it coming true in the form of Darth Malak's later assault on the Republic, at least that's how I interpreted it.

So when it was revealed that Luke went to strike down Kylo Ren because he foresaw the darkness in him, an action that caused Kylo's final descent into evil, I was instantly reminded that this moment had a precedent in the EU.

u/JohnJacksonMiller did you think of this connection to your work when you saw The Last Jedi?

How can people even argue that Kylo is more evil and less deserving of redemption than Vader?,"Like seriously, Vader murdered children. And you can argue however you want that he did it for love and to save Padmé about ten minutes later he was talking about ruling the galaxy and choking her to death.

So far we have seen/heard that Kylo has

Destroyed Luke’s Jedi temple. We have seen no evidence that Kylo murdered the other students, all we know is that he destroyed the temple which isn’t the worst thing to do after you’ve seen your master try to kill you in your sleep.

Killed Max Von Sydow and ordered the villagers dead: not good but nothing Vader hasn’t done multiple times himself.

Mindprobe Rey and Poe: I really don’t get how people can genuinely call this any form of rape, it’s the force. Was Obi Wan mindraping Stormtroopers when he used the force on them?

Starkiller Base: The novelisation of TFA shows that Kylo isn’t exactly in favour of Starkiller Base and had no role in its development and is in no position to stop it from being built. 


Killing Han: His most evil act by far, but it still pales in comparison to what Vader has done.

Injuring Finn: fair fight and was too strong for Finn

In TLJ he really doesn’t do much evil acts, his most influential act in the film is saving Rey’s life by killing Snoke.

Meanwhile Hux could have stepped up to be the maniacal supreme leader against the resistance and Luke could still be alive and used in Ep9 to work into whichever way they took the Kylo/Rey story.

Luke's wardrobe in The Last Jedi,"Ok, so I know this will probably come off as nitpicking, but I haven't seen anyone bring it up yet when TLJ is discussed. It's a minor issue i have, but I just want to say something about it. 

Anyhow.

So when we see Luke at the end of TFA, he is wearing robes very similar to what the Jedi used to wear before Order 66, but then after the first scene in TLJ, he changes into some *very* different brown/gray/blackish clothes, which probably would be a more practical pick for living on a deserted island, as far away from civilisation as possible. 

We see his Jedi robes maybe once more (not counting flashbacks) later on in the film, but for the majority of the film he wears the homeless-guy-outfit. 

So I guess what I am saying is that, lorewise, why would Luke -who has shut himself off from the Force, wants the Jedi order to end and who just wants to die- still hang on to those clothes (sentimental value perhaps, although very unlikely) and then so-happens to be wearing them the very moment Rey arrives. If he wanted to show that he was still the legendary Jedi she had been searching for that would be fine, but clearly, two seconds later (in TLJ) he wants her to go away as soon as possible. 

I am aware this is a minor issue, but it annoys me. Especially when his two outfits are so vastly different, so that when you for example (as i was doing when I decided to write this) watch Star Wars-related videos on YouTube and notice the striking difference in Luke's clothes from scene to scene. 

Oh well.

Does Kylo know that... (SPOILERS),"...his mother isn't dead?

He seems to know that she was blown up on the bridge of the shuttle they attacked, but I am not sure if he is aware of the fact that she survived, was on Crait, etc. 

If he isn't, and considering that IX was supposed to be Leia's story (7=Han, 8=Luke, 9=Leia) do you think this would have somehow factored into Kylo's arc?

Obi Wan Movie,"I was just thinking, if they did do an Obi Wan movie.... there isn't any reason Darth Vader couldn't be in it.

I know we are supposed to think that they haven't seen each other since Mustafar, but in ANH he says something like ""last time we met, I was but a learner.."" or ""I sense something, a prescence I've not felt since..."" So they don't actually state when the last time they met was.

In fact, in ROJ he says something like ""Obi wan once thought as you do.."" 

So maybe there is room to fit in a story of another showdown! In fact, the reason that Obi wan knows he is ""more machine now than man"" - means that they met up again since Anakin was turned into Darth Vader.

Hmmm...just thinking to myself really. 

I'm just keen to see more ruthless Darth Vader like we saw at the end of Rogue One.

Did this little thing about Rey in TLJ bother anyone else?,"I have nothing against Daisy Ridley, I think she is a phenomenal actress (woop go British girl) but I kind of felt like the writers didn't really understand the characters they were writing - this was especially true for Finn and Rose as well.

It was the scene where Kylo tells Rey that she knows who her parents are and asks her to say out loud who they were. Rey responds with a tear coming down her cheek that they were nobody. 

I think the line was very well delivered but it bugged me. At no point in TFA did Rey care about *who* her parents were. She never particularly cared if she was Rey Solo, Rey Kenobi or Rey Skywalker. Rey is a very trusting, naive character - it is her biggest flaw. Her entire issue with her parents is that she did not want to believe that they would abandon her **after they promised they would come back**. That's why she was so desperate to return back to Jakku in TFA (when Solo, Skywalker and Kenobi obviously weren't there). It just felt to me that lamenting over the fact that they were nobody is not what Rey would do. 

Did anyone else find that this little detail bugged them as well? ",StarWars,True,1520278273,2018-03-05
Star Wars Episode 9 Theories,"So what are your Episode 9 theories?  Don’t have any?  

I remember after Episode 7 the Internet was going crazy with theories about Episode 8. What will Luke do? Who is Snoke?  Who are Rey’s parents?  Now?  Nothing. Who is Snoke?  Who cares, he’s dead!  Who are Rey’s parents?  NOBODY!  What will Luke do?!  Suck milk out of a seal giraffe’s udders, cry for 20 mins, contemplate the murder of his sister’s kid and fade out after a Forcetime call. 

There are no questions left to be answered. The Resistabellion is basically sixty people, the First Empire got killed by a suicide bomber (great message there!), and I don’t care what happens to Finn or his pal at this point. Poe was proven to be a ridiculous idiot in TLJ so he’s done too. 

So why am I going to show up to Episode 9?  Why do I care?  Because Star Wars?  Sorry that doesn’t do it anymore. Such a strange way to tell the middle chapter of the story. In Empire we got the revelation that Vader was Luke’s father, got an awesome new character in Lando and Han gets frozen in carbonite. What will happen in RotJ?!  Buy a ticket and find out!!

An Alternate Draft of The Force Awakens,"Hey guys, I’ve been working on a story draft for an alternate version of ‘The Force Awakens’. It was the result of several long trips that left little else to do. I figured I might as well post it here in case anyone was interested in discussing or critiquing it.

I’ve tried to keep the overall story structure as close to Abrams’ film as possible while changing a few key aspects and adding some scenes. This is in no way a condemnation of The Force Awakens as a film. I like TFA very much, these are just the things I would have done differently. 

Throughout the draft I have placed various pictures/art to help convey the imagery in the scenes I am trying to get across. I do not claim that any of this artwork is my own and if any of the artists/owners have any issue with me using their work I will gladly remove it. I will include links to the draft with and without the art.

I also do not claim to have created or possess any ownership over the characters, events, setting or properties involved with this film or the Star Wars franchise as a whole. They are the creations of George Lucas and JJ Abrams and the property of Disney/Lucasfilm Ltd. If they would prefer this removed at any point I will gladly do so.

Anyways, here are the two links to the actual draft itself. It is rather longer than I initially intended and I understand if it is beyond the interest of most. Still, any discussion, critiques, ideas or questions you have for me or about the story draft are most appreciated, cheers.

Luke's unanswered questions. The curious case of The Last Jedi and its backlash.,"It's not ""who"" Luke became (a hermit waiting to die) that bothers some fans. It's the lack of details to his getting there. The film doesnt give enough backstory or do the arc justice.

For example: Why didnt Luke go after Ben or Snoke after the ""incident"" ? Why did Luke just up and leave everybody (not like him at all) ? How did Luke start the Jedi school (not even a mention)? How and Why did Ben meet Snoke ? And when did Luke find out about Snokes meddling ? Why did Luke try to kill Ben in his sleep (his sister and best friends kid) instead of talk him down ? Thats not like Luke at all from what has been in canon. And many people have a hard time buying that logic. Especially with no background detail on Ben and Snokes relationship.

Good things about Star Wars movies I don’t like,"I’m not going to even mention my complaints with the movies, I’m just going to say things I legitimately like about them. No irony, just honesty. It’s not everything, I’m sure, but I just want to be positive- because I think every Star Wars movie is someone’s favorite, and there’s no reason to hate on them for it. Thinking about each one, there’s way more good than I thought.  It’s sort of stream of consciousness, but I had a lot to say.

The Phantom Menace- I think this is a legitimately good kids movie. For me, as a child, young Anakin was one of my heroes, and being able to fly with him in a ship and get whisked away to become a Jedi was a dream come true. I also love Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and I think their performances add a lot to the movie. Darth Maul is obviously awesome, and the podrace is still really fun to watch. There are a lot of similarities to A New Hope that I didn’t pick up on until I was older, and I think it goes to show the tender care with which the movie was made. I love the practical sets, and the VFX are legendary and revolutionary for a variety of ways. The score is incredible and highly memorable, and the droid March music gets me stoked every time. Droidekas are so cool. Duel of the fates! 

Attack of the Clones- I appreciate the movie incorporating noir into Star Wars with a detective Obi-Wan storyline. Seeing a huge crowd of Jedi fighting for the first time is amazing, especially with Mace Windu and his purple lightsaber. The new planets are fleshed-out and unique. I think the costume design is also excellent, and the design of the Clones is incredible, and is actually my favorite phase of their armor. ‘Beyond the Stars,’ the love theme, is beautiful and I still listen to it from time to time. Super Battle droids rock, and seeing Yoda do crazy flips got me super hype in the theater. I also think the scene with Anakin’s mom and the sand people is equal parts touching and horrifying, and was a perfect moment for his transformation. I quote this probably more than any other Star Wars movie.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story- I got a better sense from Rogue One of what it’s like to actually live in the Star Wars universe, and we got to see a different side of the rebellion than usual. Darth Vader’s appearance was great, and his castle on Mustafar itself was well-designed, and a nice touch. Darth Vader killing all the rebels was something I’ve always wanted to see, and it made him legitimately terrifying. The way it connects to A New Hope is great, and it made me want to immediately start it up after watching Rogue One. Incorporating characters from the cartoon is something I’d still like to see more of, as long as the casting is as good as it was in RO. I thought Diego Luna was terrific, and  K2-SO was highly like-able.  The first half feels like a military thriller, and the last a heist with high stakes. The action is great throughout both of those halves. Mads Mikkelsen was awesome as well as Ben Mendelsohn. Don’t forget about the costume design, which is a stand-out. The opening is gorgeous. Also, I say “Bor Gullet will know the truth” all the time.",StarWars,True,1520306720,2018-03-05

Rebels season finale and Thrawn,"During the finale, Thrawn, Ezra and the Chimaera (and its remaining crew) were taken into Hyperspace by the purrgils. Interestingly I have just thought of something about this. When the comms officer says that the blockade ships are just gone. They weren’t destroyed, there would still be debris. Does this mean that not only the Purrgil took the Chimaera into hyperspace, but the entire remaining Seventh Fleet as well? 

Which means for the most part there could be very well be a Imperial Fleet at pre-Endor strength in the galaxy. As presumably the Chimaera still had its entire crew below decks aside from those that died on the bridge at Ezra Bridger’s hand or by the Purrgil.

I have an idea for a potentially cool scene in episode 9,"It sounds fan fictioney so I don't blame ya if you wanna downvote


Episode 9 Scene idea 

Kylo brooding (as usual) conflicted with the imbalance inside him. He's really so unsure of what he wants to be, he doesn't have his old master, either of his parents, nobody. He's all alone.

Suddenly we begin to hear an echoey voice, saying ""Ben, Ben, Ben!"" Louder and louder. 

Kylo is confused, he looks around to see the vision of old Ben Kenobi standing. Kylo knows exactly who the man he was named after is. He turns away

Kylo: I don't speak with old dead men, I have nothing to say to you

Sudden voice change, the voice of Ben Kenobi sounds much younger and when Kylo turns to face him he sees a young obi wan Kenobi, played by Ewan McGregor of course. 

Kenobi: perhaps you won't speak with me, but I've brought along a friend.

Obi wan disappears and a figure walks towards Ben, which looks oddly like the shadow of Darth Vader. But as the figure walks closer, the shadow begins to fall and evaporate bit by bit, revealing underneath it another man shrouded in the blue aura of the force. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen deserves another chance) 

Scene continues with Kylo getting some advice from his grandfather who he greatly respects and admires, but whom he'll eventually disregard because there's too much anger in him.",StarWars,True,1519246638,2018-02-21

A lot of people might be misinterpreting the message of the Last Jedi (an opinion),"Sometimes I feel like many people have made a bad interpretation of the many nihilistic opinions in the first two acts of The Last Jedi. Mainly, Luke saying the Jedi and Sith don't matter and the Jedi were wrong and it doesn't matter and DJ saying no good guys or bad guys and Kylo Ren Saying Let the Past die. I don't think these aren't the themes of the movie at all, but rather something I would like to call a counter theme. They are the antithesis (exact ideological opposite) of the actual theme of the movie, always striving to do good regardless of mistakes of the past. The Last Jedi is not much of a de-constructionist or post-modern movie. It actually may be the opposite.

DJ is don’t join. And the film portrays him as bad. He's one of the two options Finn has to be after he leaves the first order. DJ doesn’t care what's right and what's wrong, it doesn’t matter at all to him. He's Finn's nihilism when he wants to leave Maz's castle. DJ (don’t join), is Luke on the island, who doesn’t care, and says the Jedi are wrong and it doesn’t matter. Finn's other choice is rose. The brave and loyal resistance worker who is highly opinionated and always can clearly see right and wrong, and can see through Canto-Bight's shiny bullshit.

In the third act, Finn chooses to become a hero, he fights Captain Phasma and was ready to die for the resistance on Cait, and Luke chooses to become a hero, after his interactions with R2D2 and Yoda's ghost, and dies for the resistance on Crait. Both of the characters overcome a form of nihilism, and embrace the light side if the force instead of saying nothing matters, walk away from it all, don't join. 

DJ's speech was absolutely incorrect, and was what many people today say in TV shows like Big Mouth and Rick and Morty (I do like both of these shows, by the way, I'm not hating on them). There seems to almost be a cultural movement of nihilism right now because we made mistakes as a culture in the past, nothing matters. The term that's been coined to describe it is post-modernism. Make no mistake, The Last Jedi doesn't promote post-modernism, it critiques it. He said there are no real good guys or bad guys, and anyone who believes in the concept of objective morality is locked in a system, and Finn decides that the path of nihilism is not his calling, but rather the path of meaning. 

TLDR; DJ's speech is saying nothing matters, and there are no good guys or bad guys. The fight is meaningless This is exactly how Luke felt about the Jedi about how Kylo felt about the first order. He told Rey it doesn’t matter and they should burn it all down. The movie shows us this line of thinking is wrong through Yoda's speech and Luke's speech at the end, which are the ideological opposite of DJ's speech. They say that the war has just begun. We should learn from the past instead of abandoning and questioning everything. This is the opposite of the deconstructionist message a lot of people believe TLJ has.

#While the prequel trilogy teaches us the dangers of ideology, with Anakin, the Jedi, and Darth Sidious, the sequel trilogy teaches us the dangers of completely abandoning ideology instead of learning from it. Both are valuable lessons. Both great movies in my opinion. And if you don't like them, or even hate them, that's fine too! The above was just my opinions. Keep any comments you make comments civil everyone!",StarWars,True,1519256020,2018-02-21

Part of what I think is rather confusing about Luke is the apparent ease in which Snoke died. If Kylo and Rey could do it, surely Luke in his prime could too? If Snoke is actually a secret genius or a force god or something, well that would be something else. Not that I wish to imply that Luke wasn't woefully underqualified for the role of jedi master.

******

**Officer:** General, there’s a lone starfighter approaching the ship.

**Hux:** What business has he here?

**Officer:** It seems that he wants to engage in Marvel dialogue, sir.

**Hux:** Very well. While I’m distracted, be sure not to fire on the ships or do anything to prevent their escape.

******

**Officer:** Sir, we can’t hit that X-Wing. It’s too small, and moving too fast for our auto-cannons.

**Canady:** Are you kidding me? You mean the thing our auto-cannons haven’t been able to do since the Death Star, like 30 years ago? How have we *still* not figured this out? Who was in charge of building this military anyways?

**Hux:** Hey, Canady, when the radio-thingy talks to me, how does the little man inside the console know what to say? Thinking about it makes my head hurt.

**Canady:** Oh, right.

******

**Rebel 1:** Alright, Poe’s hit ‘em with the Marvel dialogue, and Hux is trying to remember how to tie his shoes. Time to move in with Phase Two of Poe’s plan—send in the bombers.

**Rebel 2:** Got it, I’ll get the Y-Wings.

**Rebel 1:** Whoa there, partner. What made you think we were using Y-Wings?

**Rebel 2:** Well, we’re still using X-Wings. And Mon Calamari cruisers. And the First Order is using Tie Fighters. Actually, all of the ships and vehicles are exactly the same.

**Rebel 1:** Not this time. Let me ask you—what’s the one thing that the Y-Wing lacked?

**Rebel 2:** I honestly can’t think of anything.

**Rebel 1:** I’ll tell you what—a leisurely pace. No rushing with this baby. Plus, it doesn’t put too much pressure on the pilot, since the bombs are detonated with a manual button separate from the cockpit.

**Rebel 2:** That sounds really inconvenient.

**Rebel 1:** Oh, it is. Well, you better get out there. Just one thing, real quick. Now, try not to collide with anything because—and really, this is totally nothing to worry about—if the bomb bay brushes with anything, at all, it might *possibly* immediately blow up. 

**Rebel 2:** Uh, OK. Well we’re not going to be flying really close to one another, right? That way none of the debris from the other ships might hit mine.

**Rebel 1:** Yep. Yes. Totally. Go get ‘em.  

******

**Leia:** Poe, what the hell was that? 

**Poe:** Uh, it’s called winning, duh.

**Leia:** You just got, like fifty people killed! And lost all our ships! After I told you not to!

**Poe:** Yeah, but I got to look good.

**Leia:** Do you understand the concept of orders?

**Poe:** Being a hero means never following orders, ever, even when I’m clearly wrong and it hurts the people around me.

******

**Snoke:** Do you know why I keep a rabid cur like Hux around?

**Kylo:** Actually, I have been wondering that. He’s really gullible and can’t seem to do anything right.

**Snoke:** Precisely. In this new trilogy, the way of the Dark Side is to be talked up as a threat, but to be constantly outsmarted and ineffectual.

**Kylo:** Wow, you really are the worst villain ever.

**Snoke:** Yeah, well your helmet looks dumb.

**Kylo:** I’m so glad I killed my father for you.

******

**Luke:** You think I came to the most unfindable place in the galaxy so you could just find me?

**Rey:** Well, you left a map in R2-D2.

**Luke:** I never thought anyone would ever suspect there was a map of my location inside the robot who has done all my navigating for over 20 years.

**Rey:** He woke up a few days ago and showed me the map.

**Luke:** Why did he wake up then, of all times?

**Rey:** That’s an excellent question. Anyways, the rest of the map was in some other droid.

**Luke:** Wait, where did it get the missing parts from?

**Rey:** Max von Sydow, I think.

**Luke:** Well where did he get it?

**Rey:** I have no idea.

******

**Leia:** They’ve tracked us through lightspeed.

**Poe:** That’s impossible!

**Leia:** Yes, it is.

**Poe:** So how did they do it?

**Leia:** I don’t know.

**Poe:** Do they have a spy on board?

**Leia:** I don’t know.

**Poe:** Is this some new technology?

**Leia:** I don’t know.

**Poe:** Great, let’s never talk about this again.

******

**Rebel:** Look, General Organa is alive! She’s using the Force to get back to the ship!

**Poe:** Amazing! Well, that makes sense, seeing that she was always Force-sensitive. Let me take a look at this majestic sight— 

**Rebel:** Huh.

**Poe:** Yeah, that looks really dumb.

******

**Rose:** I joined the Resistance with my sister. She was a brave, capable, self-sacrificing ace pilot, who was animated with a compelling, non-verbal performance that made the audience like her despite a short amount of time on-screen.

**Finn:** Wow, she sounds amazing. So what does that make you?

**Rose:** I’m the other one.

******

**Commander D’Acy:** Well, everyone is dead. And because we couldn’t let a filthy alien have an important role in this trilogy, that includes Admiral Ackbar. To replace him, here is hitherto unmentioned Vice Admiral “Not Admiral Ackbar” Holdo.

**Holdo:** Despite my lack of gills or otherwise interesting character design, I am a veteran military commander who has won impressive victories in the past. The hour may be grave, but with sane, sober leadership, I am confident that we can survive this. Just so long as no one does anything completely idiotic.

**Poe:** Hold my beer.

******

**Poe:** ‘Sup loser. Don’t mind me, just Poe Dameron, Resistance hero.

**Holdo:** OK.

**Poe:** So listen, babe, I’d like to know about what, uh, “plan” you’ve come up with. Just wanted to make sure it met my genius approval.

**Holdo:** Didn’t you get demoted, like, an hour ago for compromising one of Leia’s plans by abusing your discretion?

**Poe:** Yeah, total BS. Anyways, honey, you mind just making sure I know every detail of this plan so I can tell you—loudly and in front of others—why you’re wrong and I think you should do what I say? And get me a drink while you’re at it, chop chop.

**Holdo:** Uh, alright, how about no, and maybe I’ll tell you what you need to know later?

**Poe:** WHAT. Don’t you know how cool I am? That means you *have* to tell me!

**Holdo:** I actually don’t. Do you know what the chain of command is?

**Poe:** Yeah, it’s where everyone does what I say, and then they die.

******

**Poe:** It’s a disaster, Finn. Holdo won’t let me, her direct inferior, order her around! She won’t even tell me every single detail of her plan, so I can disobey her orders! It’s ridiculous!

**Finn:** Wow, it’s like she doesn’t even know that you’re chronically unreliable and self-absorbed.

**Poe:** I know right!

**Rose:** I’m Rose.

**Poe:** Cool. Anyways, what are we going to do? We’re trapped on a ship with nothing to do, while Rey is training with space wizard Jesus! At this rate, we’re not getting any screentime!

**Rose:** I’m Rose.

**Poe:** . . . OK?

**Finn:** What we need is some choice filler. Something pointless, stupid, and bound to take up at least an hour of this movie that could be better spent elsewhere. Rose and I have a plan.

**Poe:** This plan, is it also reckless and bound to put unknowing people at risk of death?

**Finn:** Absolutely.

**Poe:** Then I’m in. We can’t tell Holdo, though. She’s a rational human being, so she’ll probably think this is stupid.

******

**Poe:** Alright, so let me see if I have this straight. You’re going to sneak abroad the First Order fleet. Which you have no clue how to do.

**Finn:** Yep.

**Poe:** Then infiltrate the ship through equally unknown means.

**Finn:** Yes.

**Poe:** And then find the tracking thing which we didn’t know existed until an hour ago. And which might not even exist, since we have no idea how they found us.

**Finn:** You got it.

**Poe:** And which we know nothing about, including what it looks like or how it works.

**Finn:** Ah, but we *do* know where it is. You see, I was a janitor.

**Poe:** Were you a janitor aboard that specific ship? The one that it is clearly a hundred times bigger than the others and has a completely different design?

**Finn:** I was not.

**Poe:** And Rose?

**Finn:** Rose will also be there.

**Poe:** I see no flaw with this plan. But if we’re coming up with a way to waste time, there’s one other person we need.

******

**Maz:** Buh . . . uh, what? So sleepy. Am I in this movie?

**Poe:** You are now. I need to find something for Finn and this other person to do. You’re my only hope.

**Finn:** Maz, I figured that if anyone knew the solitary person in the galaxy who could break First Order codes, it was a bartender I’ve met exactly once a few days ago.

**Maz:** Inexplicably, you would be right. Go to Space Monte Carlo. There, you will find a roguish thief and codebreaker able to help you.

**Finn:** Is it— 

**Maz:** It’s not Lando.

******

**Officer:** General, an escape pod is leaving the Resistance ship. Should we fire on it?

**Hux:** Hmm, would that be the competent thing to do?

**Officer:** It would, sir.

**Hux:** Better not, then. Back to my crayons.

******

**Luke:** I refuse to train you.

**Rey:** But I really want you to.

**Luke:** Sucks to suck. I need to milk this mighty beast and— oh no.

**Rey:** What?

**Luke:** I felt a disturbance. Something terrible is happening. Finn is getting his own sub-plot.

**Rey:** Dear God.

**Luke:** Only interesting training sequences and genuine character development from us can save this movie. But we must work quickly. I sense something surrounding Finn, an awful grey void of pure boringness and terrible dialogue.

**Rey:** Finn’s new girlfriend!

**Luke:** The Force requires balance. Get me the hottest, most interesting boy you know.

**Kylo:** Ladies.

******

**Rose:** Here we are, Space Monte Carlo.

**Finn:** Holy shit, this place is lame.

**Rose:** Agreed.

**Finn:** Let’s stay here another eternity.

******

**Rey:** You seem really bummed, Master Skywalker. Are you sure that coming back with me and kicking a little Imperial ass won’t help?

**Luke:** Alright, here’s a brain-teaser for you, Rey. What is the point of all this?

**Rey:** Well, a master Jedi teaching the young hero the ways of the Force is a staple of the franchise, so—”

**Luke:** No, I mean this whole conflict. I spent my whole life trying to fight the Empire. I can’t even tell you how many friends I saw die, how many innocents suffered, to help the Rebellion. I redeemed my father, restored the Republic, rebuilt the Jedi Order after all of them were lost. And now, twenty years later, what happened? The Republic fell *again*, and Jedi were wiped out *again*, and there’s a rebellion fighting the Empire *again*. It’s still just X-Wings and Tie Fighters, and plucky rebels against evil stormtroopers. The only difference now is that my best friend is dead, and I have a sweet-ass beard. 

**Rey:** Well, it *is* pretty sweet.

**Luke:** Rey, what was the point of all that fighting and struggle and sacrifice if we are always, *always* just going to end up back where we started? Why should I go with you and keep fighting if nothing I did or will do matters? It’s like we’re trapped in a loop orchestrated by a talentless hack director, one that banks entirely on stealing other people’s work and banking on nostalgia.

**Rey:** . . . Well crap, now I’m depressed.

**Luke:** Blame J.J. Abrams.

******

**Finn:** Well, we didn’t find the master codebreaker. This side-plot is a bust.

**Rose:** Maybe we could find someone who is like the master codebreaker, except not, and is far less trustworthy

**DJ:** ‘Sup.

******

**Kylo:** Rey, join the Dark Side with me. It’s sweet.

**Rey:** Listen, murderer, I’m not interested in— OH MY GOODNESS

**Kylo:** What?

**Rey:** Your *chest!* It looks like the front of an 18-wheeler! How did you get so buff?

**Kylo:** Holding up this trilogy.

******

**DJ:** Would you look at that. Resistance, First Order, both buy weapons. B-b-both sides are the same, dog.

**Finn:** Well, I mean they clearly aren’t, one of them blew up like 5 planets yesterda—

**DJ:** Both sides.

******

**Poe:** What the hell are you doing?

**Holdo:** Evacuating the ship, obviously. We’re about to run out of fuel, we’ll die if we stay here.

**Poe:** Evacuate the ship? When its barely able to move and nearly in range of an entire fleet? Traitor!

**Holdo:** Wh— I— How— *What!?* How am I the traitor? You’re leading a mutiny!

**Poe:** Mutiny isn’t treason!

**Holdo:** Do you even know what treason is?

**Poe:** I think it’s when someone prevents me from doing whatever I want, all the time.

******

**Holdo:** Poe committed a mutiny, held me hostage, and tried to prevent the evacuation that we both know is crucial to the Resistance’s survival.

**Leia:** If he had succeeded, we would have all died. And this is just hours after I demoted him for disobeying orders and getting people killed.

**Holdo:** I like him.

**Leia:** I know, right? 

******

**DJ:** Got the d-d-d-door open, boss.

**Finn:** Wow, that was incredibly easy. I thought that Maz said that only one person in the universe could do this?

**Rose:** Man, if you can’t trust bartenders working in the Not Mos Eisley Cantina on Not Naboo for information of galactic importance, who can you trust?

******

**Snoke:** Is there a reason you’ve entered my robe-room, and interrupted my special robe-time?

**Kylo:** Remember how you told me that you made this room to meet women? Check this babe out.

**Snoke:** Ah, Skywalker’s apprentice. Well, time for this big bad to take a float on the gloat-boat. Adequate work, Ren.

**Kylo:** Yeah, about that. I just had a quick question: why are you here?

**Snoke:** I told you, Ren: robe-time.

**Kylo:** No, in this story. What purpose are you serving?

**Snoke:** There must be a master and an apprentice, Ren. It is the Sith way.

**Kylo:** I thought we were supposed to be different from the Sith. And if we really need that dynamic, I have the Knights of Ren.

**Snoke:** Oh right, they exist. Anyways, someone had to turn you to the Dark Side, right?

**Kylo:** Did I? I mean, I idolized Darth Vader. Couldn’t I have just turned on my own, through my own twisted motivation to break from the past? That’s my motive for evil—what’s yours?

**Snoke:** Young fool, you cannot possibly fathom— 

**Kylo:** You don’t have one?

**Snoke:** Well, no.

**Kylo:** Alright, well what’s your backstory? Mine is really interesting.

**Snoke:** Uhhhh . . .

**Kylo:** Complex struggle? Fun performance? Sinister presence? Anything at all?

**Snoke:** What are you saying, apprentice? That I’m a worthless, needless addition to this franchise, included only because J.J. Abrams wanted a pet ripoff of the Emperor? That you’re an infinitely better character in every way that really should have just been the main villain from the start? That the best way to salvage this plot is to kill me off and take over that role now?

**Kylo:** Oh no, totally not. By the way, could you maybe just shut your eyes and not look at that lightsaber for a minute?

**Snoke:** Well, I don’t see why not— *HURK*

******

**Kylo:** Snoke died as he lived: being lame as hell. Want to relieve some sexual tension with a steamy throne room fight sequence?

**Rey:** Oh God yes.

******

**Phasma:** Ah, Finn! We meet again at last!

**Finn:** Oh Jesus, you’re still alive?

**Phasma:** Yes, it is I! Phasma, your nemesis!

**Finn:** You’re not my nemesis. 

**Phasma:** Nu-uh! I’m super-threatening!

**Finn:** The last time we “fought,” I threw you in a garbage can. Why did they even bring you back? You’re never going to be taken seriously.

**Phasma:** But I’m the new Boba Fett!

**Finn:** Maybe the JJ Abrams field you’re projecting is making me forget, but I don’t remember Boba Fett feeling desperate and forced and sad.

**Phasma:** Alright, this is getting a little too real. Time to execute you in the slowest, most easily escapade way possible.

******

**Rey:** That fight scene was fucking amazing. Welcome to the Light side, Ben.

**Kylo:** How about no?

**Rey:** Wait, I thought we were doing Return of the Jedi?

**Kylo:** Yeah, you *thought* that. But actually, the same tendency that makes you see fathers in the strong figures of your life—feelings born from your parental abandonment—caused you to overlook the sad and tragic truth of my character. Your lonely upbringing and desire to have a purpose made you compassionate and driven, but also blind to my unbalanced madness. Now, we’ve reached the point that you and I both care for each other, and don’t want to fight any longer, but cannot convince the other to switch sides and are unwilling to do so ourselves, a tragedy of failed redemption and friends-battling-friends that combines some of the best aspects of the previous two trilogies.

**Rey:** Wow, that’s actually really cool.

**Kylo:** Well, what do you expect? One of these plots had to be good.

******

**Kylo:** I know the terrible secret of your parentage, Rey.

**Rey:** Uh oh.

**Kylo:** You . . . are *not* related to me.

**Rey:** Oh thank *God.*

******

**Holdo:** Admiral Ackbar!

**Leia:** Oh my God, Holdo’s gone to lightspeed and destroyed 
the First Order fleet!

**Rebel:** This has to be one of the most visually stunning scenes in this whole franch— Wait, can we do that? Ram things with lightspeed?

**Leia:** Of course.

**Rebel:** So why haven’t we done it before?

**Leia:** Because . . . uh, actually, why didn’t we, Poe?

**Poe:** **pulls down chart** You’ve got me. By all accounts, it doesn’t make sense.

******

**Luke:** I’m burning the special Jedi tree.

**Yoda:** Like hell you are. Check this shit, you will.

**Luke:** Whoa! You can summon lightning? Wait, can Force-ghosts interact with the world?

**Yoda:** A new thing this is, pretty sure I am.

**Luke:** Well crap, this changes everything! Will this have any kind of importance for the plot?

**Yoda:** Probably not.

******

**Leia:** They’ve heard the signal. No one is coming. It’s as though there’s something about our leadership and overall conduct that makes us look like idiots.

**Poe:** We can’t give up. Not now. Men of the Resistance, I see a fear in your eyes that would take the heart of me. But what we need now is hope. The hope we felt after I illegally ordered the dreadnaught attack, in which so many people died. The hope you had in the fleet, while I led a mutiny against my rightful officer. The hope I can still see now, even after 90% of the Resistance is dead due solely to my actions. I won’t give up now, not after all the people I got killed through my incredible bravery and heroics.

**Leia:** This is how a true leader talks.

**Poe:** We can’t give up. Because of what we are. We are the spark, that will light the fire, that will light the torch, that will be thrown on the powder keg, that will blow up the wall, that will knock down the dominoes, that will in turn push the brick, that will light the match, that will ignite the gasoline, that will start the other fire that will burn the First Order to the ground.

**Rebel:** Are you drunk?

**Poe:** The gasoline . . . called *freedom.*

******

**Poe:** My plan is so simple that an idiot could have devised it. We hop in these slow, barely working Ford Pintos and fly at the walkers in a straight line, screaming at the top of our lungs.

**Finn:** OK, but they have weapons that can destroy the cannon, right?

**Poe:** Probably not? I mean seriously, look at that thing. These little lasers are tiny, and that’s assuming they even work. This mission will be incredibly dangerous to everyone that isn’t me. I’m not going to lie: everyone here who doesn’t have a name is going to die.

**Nameless Rebels:** I really hate this army.

******

**Rebel 1:** Is there any particular reason we’re out in these trenches? They’re going to use that cannon thing before they even get close, and we’re right in front of the door.

**Rebel 2:** Listen, I’ve just stopped questioning why anyone does anything around here. Huh, what’s this?

**Rebel 1:** What, the stuff on the ground?

**Rebel 2:** Looks like it’s the author’s reaction to this movie.

**Rebel 1:** What? What does that— 

**Rebel 2:** Salt.

******

**Poe:** Finn! Pull back!

**Finn:** I’m sacrificing myself.

**Poe:** That’s a reckless, brash, pointless move, Finn! If anyone’s doing one of those, it’ll be *me!*

**Finn:** Alright, Poe. I’m going to level with you here: it’s pretty clear that the people making these movies have no idea what to do with me. I’m going to just nip the next casino side-plot in the bud and end it all here.

**Poe:** But Finn, you can’t! Just imagine how many more side-plots you have with Rose to live for!

**Finn:** Roger, Poe. Full speed ahead. Admiral Ackbar!

******

**Finn:** Well, so this is a heroic sacrifice. Glad I’m getting that out of the way, since absolutely no one else is lined up to do one of those in this movie.

**Rose:** Interesting plot development? Not if I have anything to say about it. Admiral Ackbar! 

*ROSECRASH*

**Finn:** Wha— Why did— Why!? I was going to save everyone! Well, maybe.

**Rose:** Because that’s how we’re gonna win. Not by destroying what we hate. By saving what we love. 

**Finn:** . . . No, I’m pretty sure we’ll need to destroy things. Isn’t like, your only defining trait a desire to destroy places like Space Monte Carlo?

**Rose:** Don’t worry about that Finn. We’ll have plenty of time to develop my character in our next sideplot. I hope you’re ready for Episode IX, because I am never, ever, ever, leaving your side!

**Finn:** *Internal screaming*

******

**Poe:** Time to blow this joint. Follow me, everyone!

**Leia:** What are you looking at me for, follow him!

**Rebel:** But you’re the general.

**Leia:** Who cares? Follow him.

**Rebel:** But you demoted him.

**Leia:** That doesn’t matter now.

**Rebel:** But you demoted him because he disobeyed orders and got so many of us killed for no reason.

**Leia:** Well, he’s grown a lot since then.

**Rebel:** But he got almost all of the Resistance killed yet again only hours after by disobeying orders from Holdo. He’s the only reason we’re trapped here.

**Leia:** And Poe got demoted for a few hours, before I showered him with praise again. Sometimes, having no consequences for someone’s behavior is the best way for them to learn. It’s not like his actions had any real costs.

**Rebel:** All of my friends are dead.

**Leia:** What a little rascal.

******

**Hux:** Luke Skywalker is just standing down there.

**Kylo:** I’m gonna fight him.

**Hux:** Could you maybe chill?

**Kylo:** No dice, Hux. I’m Supreme Leader now, and you know what that means. 

**Hux:** Uh, you need to be as incompetent as hell?

**Kylo:** You know it. Make sure all the troops are watching while I fail to beat up this old person.

******

**Hux:** Well, all the rebels are gone. I guess we lost. Again.

**Kylo:** Impossible! Snoke taught me everything he knew about being short-sighted and stupid!

**Hux:** Well, the student has become the master.

******

**Rey:** Oh, hey Finn! Glad to see you’re still alive.

**Finn:** I really wish I could say the same.

**Rey:** I’ve gotta tell you, my plotline in this episode was *choice.* Space magic, character development, betrayal, lost friendship, this one guy with pecs like two Death Stars, the whole nine yards. So, what happened to you?

**Finn:** Uh . . . I think I got a girlfriend.

**Rose:** I’m Rose.

**Rey:** . . . Her?

*******

**Poe:** Alright, we managed to escape. How many people did we start with?

**Leia:** Six thousand.

**Poe:** And how many are left?

**Leia:** Six . . .

**Poe:** WOOOOO

**Leia:** Six. There are six people left in the Resistance.

**Poe:** Well, my work here is done. You’re welcome, everyone. Poe Dameron, Resistance hero.

(TLJ) I didn't like the Yoda scene...,"Beyond the initial suprise, after reflecting for some time this scene just didn't work for me. Why? Because in my opinion it made Luke seem rash and unwise. Again, that's just my opinion.

We know that was how Luke was in the OT. That's fine, he was young and inexperienced. But after 30 years I had hoped for Luke to become wiser than what he was here.

Rashly trying to burn the tree, then becoming indecisive, then panicking when Yoda set it alight. Being knocked to the ground with Yoda laughing, Yoda still referring to Luke as young Skywalker, and followed by a lesson from Yoda. It just didn't work for me.

Remember Obiwan in the OT. He really was a counterpart to Yoda. He even counselled Yoda in TESB. He wasn't always so wise in his youth but he became that person. Can we say that Luke grew to Obiwan's level? I don't think so.

How much wiser are our parents and teachers than we are? After 30 years I don't think Luke had grown in a satisfying way. That left me feeling disappointed.

That's just the way I feel everyone. I'm predicting this will be torn to shreds. But please, let me reiterate that this is only my opinion. I'm not here to blindly hate. I'm curious if anyone felt a similar way?",StarWars,True,1519265703,2018-02-21
An Elderly Couple Plays the Star War,"[Image](https://i.imgur.com/RSSYn89.png)

Transcription:

[Owen KC Stephens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_K.C._Stephens)

When the original d20 Star Wars RPG was being released, Wizards of the Coast had a launch party for it at a local Planet Hollywood. Jake Lloyd and Peter Mayhew were there, as were some other Star Wars people of import, and I and several other designers ran intro games for them and anyone else who came along and was interested.

I ran the intro scenario several times, and most of those sessions are a blur. We used Star Wars action figures rather than miniatures, and most groups barely got through one encounter. It was fun, but most people did more laughing and movie quotes than gaming.

But one elderly couple with brilliant British accents came along and said they were on vacation and had just wanted to eat at a Planet Hollywood, but had been told there was a game launch. There knew they were welcome, and had grabbed some food from the buffet, but if there was a game they were interested in trying it. But they had no idea what ""Star Wars"" was.

So I showed them the good guy figures, and told them these were members of the Rebel Alliance, who fought for freedom and fairness against the tyrannical bad guys.

""Ah,"" said the elderly gentlemen. His face was a lean angular shape covered in tiny wrinkles, he walked with a cane, his hair was sheet white, but his eyes seemed bright and alert. ""So they’re the French Resistance, are they?""

Well I admitted, yeah basically.

Then he picked up an Imperial officer figure, and looked it over.

""And this is a Space Nazi?""

Ah… yes. Their troops are even called Stormtroopers.

""Oh!"" said his wife. ""It’s like The War.""

""Right,"" said he sitting. ""How do we play?""

I had those two wonderful people, with decades of experience and clearly a strong idea of what military work is actually like, and three teen fanboys. The elderly gentleman took charge, got the mission objective out of me, and…

And ran the PC team like real commandos. Scouts. Ambushes. Covering fire. Raiding enemy gear. Firing from cover. Sticking to the objective. I was making stuff up to cover some of the things he wanted to do, because I didn’t know the rules that well. And I was up front about it, and made it clear that was part of the fun. You can try anything in an RPG. The GM just works out what dice to roll.

The teens just started calling his character ""The Lieutenant,"" and hung on his every word. And unlike every other group I ran that night, they got through the whole short introductory adventure. And won. Without Jedi.

Everyone smiled and clapped when they were done. And the couple decided they’d pick up a copy back home, and introduce the game to their friends. I’m pretty sure they were both in their mid 80s back when this happened, in 2000. But I like to think they are still playing some RPG, with their group of friends in England, merrily making commando raids to this day.",StarWars,True,1519266018,2018-02-21
Why is the use of the Force so massively inconsistent?,"There are so many instances throughout The Clone Wars series where situations could have been easily solved by using the Force. S2E11, ""Lost Lightsaber"" is a great example. As soon as Ahsoka's saber was stolen, she could have simply Force-grabbed it back. She again has this opportunity when chasing the bounty hunter. She also has multiple opportunities to knock her over with the Force. It's beginning to become incredibly frustrating to watch all of these crisis situations which can be easily solved with the Force. ",StarWars,True,1519267636,2018-02-21

Who will help the resistance in episode IX?,"So, as we know, the resistance needs a new fleet. How will they get it? Will the time lapse just skip over this and have Leia purchase replacement ships, or will some other factions come into play in IX? Maybe the new republic (which we've been told lost their fleet to SKB. Which makes absolutely no sense. Not only would a Galaxy wide republic have multiple fleets, but they also wouldn't have EVERY single ship parked in one system), or the Chiss (who seem to share some sort of connection to Snoke) or could it be someone else? Maybe the Mandolorians (last we checked on them, Bo Katan was taking over as the Mandalore) or the Mon Calamari?

So as you can see, there are quite a few options. As a sci fi nerd who loves his space ships, I'm personally hoping for something that gives the artists a license to get creative and make something new. So I'd prefer a faction like the Chiss, or maybe the Mando's.",StarWars,True,1519306686,2018-02-22
KotOR music cue in Rogue One?,"So I was listening to Full of Sith's excellent 3 part podcast series called ""How the Force Works"" about the music of the sequels (with most of the attention on TLJ) and at one point the host points out that if you speed up the track ""Hope"" on the Rogue One soundtrack, the choir fits in perfectly to the Imperial March. Well, when they played Hope at 2x speed, the horns that accompany the choir also sounded familiar. 

Now I'm very much a music novice, so I can't even tell if these are the same notes or not, but the horns, especially at 2x speed, sound very similar to a section from Darth Malak's Theme from Knights of the Old Republic. But you don't have to take my word for it thanks to the magic of youtube!

Here is the track ""Hope"" from Rogue One, which youtube lets you play at 2x speed.

Shower Thought: Episode IX will open with General Organa's funeral.,"With the passing of Carrie, and no shots of IX filmed, we will need to fill a gap between VIII and IX on what happened to Leia.  

I do not think they will handle an Original 3 character's death offscreen.

So what do you do?  How do you do it?

You can either have a flashback - or - you open IX with Organa's funeral.  You can still do a time jump,say 5 years,  and celebrate the life of Leia in one swoop.  

You can even mention it in the crawl.

Paragraph one - turmoil in the galaxy

Paragraph two - The First Order, under the direction of Kylo Ren has flourished...

Paragraph three - ...while the Rebels mourn the loss of one of their own.


Cut down from a planet - maybe Corellia (which would tie the Solo movie in) - i imagine where Han is ""buried"".  You can have side by side graves - tying his death in VII and the funeral we never saw for him- to Leia's death in IX.

"Thanks to 'The Last Jedi', I'm now okay with Hayden Christensen's Force Ghost in 'Return of the Jedi'.","I've been a vocal opponent of Hayden Christensen appearing as Anakin's force ghost at the end of the DVD edition of Return of the Jedi for years. I felt like it actively diminished Anakin's narrative arc by implying that he died at Mustafar, rather than when he killed the Emperor. 

Sebastian Shaw's ghost appearance implies that Anakin Skywalker never truly died, that Luke WAS right, and he managed to redeem his father from his hellish, waking nightmare, resulting in a real narrative and emotional payoff. Whereas, Hayden's appearance robs us of this, and implies that Luke's father was truly dead and incapable of being redeemed. Darth Vader is then, in effect, a completely separate persona and it is he one who turns, which doesn't feel as satisfying to me.

However, given Old Man Luke's use of force projections to reflect himself as a slightly younger man to manipulate Kylo Ren's anger, I can see how Anakin's spirit form would prefer to appear as he once did, and how he last saw himself. So I absolutely concede this point.

That being said, they need to reshoot that footage of him they inserted, because he looks completely oblivious to whatever is going on around him. Have him at least look at Obi-Wan and Yoda, dammit! This is the new hill I have chosen to die on.",StarWars,True,1519315488,2018-02-22

Question about Light Saber Physics...,"This may seem like a silly question but bear with me: In the official SW canon, do lightsaber ""blades"" have any mass? 

The obvious answer would seem to be no, yet it always seemed to me that the way they behave in the films when being swung around often gives the impression that they do indeed have mass, with Kylo Ren's lightsaber being the most obvious example. 

Presumably KR's saber was an intentional stylistic decision to make it seem like he's swinging around a weapon with tremendous power (even if it doesn't really make any sense that it would be significantly harder to swing around than a conventional lightsaber), and presumably in the OT they appeared that way because the actors were really swinging around physical objects, with fake ""blades"" that actually had mass.

On the other hand the lightsabers in the prequel trilogy seemed to actually behave like you'd expect, i.e. extremely nimble and easy to swing around quickly and gracefully due to having no mass in the blades (which, presumably, also aligns with what the actors were actually holding while being filmed EDIT: They obviously weren't, see below).

So, does anyone know what the ""official"" answer is on this?",StarWars,True,1519317816,2018-02-22

Why Luke throws the saber,"Luke sees the saber as his legacy, the ""legend of Luke Skywalker"" that people associate with him. Once Rey approaches him with his old saber, he chucks it because he feels that his legacy is bullshit, plagued with tragedy and ruin. There's a reason why you don't see Luke's green lightsaber on the island, he probably destroyed it after trying to kill his nephew. He only see guilt when it comes to weapons like that. 

Nobody should want a part in his story, especially Rey. Not only that, but it is a literal action, Luke wants the audience to throw their expectations out the window about TLJ . 

Only in the end, when Luke appears on Crait is when we see his saber, not only to use it to duel with Ben, but to cement his place as a legend, and only by doing that will there be hope.   ",StarWars,True,1519323099,2018-02-22

The fateful moment with Luke and Ben Solo.,"A major argument for Luke's mischaracterization is when he briefly considers murdering Ben. Some believe the ""real"" Luke wouldn't be capable of such a moment, I disagree. 

Others have brought up parallels with Luke's actions at the end of RotJ and elsewhere in the OT, but I want to focus on his momentary motivation standing over Ben and what he saw in his nephew. I've seen multiple people, twice yesterday prompting this post, claim it's preposterous Luke would consider murder merely because he ""saw a bit of the dark side in him."" I think this downplay of Luke's belief in what Ben was already and would become is one reason why so many have a skewed view of Luke in TLJ. Here's Luke's description of events:

&gt;I saw darkness. I sensed it building in him. I'd seen it in moments during his training. But then I looked inside, and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction, pain, death, and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct, I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame and with consequence. And the last thing I saw were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him.

It's not a mere hint of the dark side or a suspicion of things to come, he *knows* Ben has already turned and will kill those he loves. A strength of conviction in the truthfulness of present and future events comparable to Anakin after his vision of Padme's death. Anakin was so convinced she'd die he was willing to betray everything he stood for and become Darth Vader. Unlike his father, however, Luke overcomes his fear and resists the urge to act on the vision and attempt to stop it. It's his nature to believe everyone is capable of redemption, the very nature people claim is destroyed by this scene, that allows for the urge to pass as quickly as it does. 

I've seen some mention Luke's action at the end of RotJ as proof he had completed a character arc in achieving complete rejection of the dark side and utter belief in everyone's redemption. That's simply not how humans work. Luke is human and is capable of moments of weakness and doubt whether or not he was able to previously overcome them. 

Say what you will about whether it was a poor decision to set up this moment in the first place, but I believe Luke's behavior in it is consistent with his character. ",StarWars,True,1519329141,2018-02-22

For those of you worried about Chris Terrio writing Episode 9,"I really dont think you should be! 

I have been part of the DC fandom for a while too and followed all the drama behind that.

For BVS, that was not Terrio's story. The story was set, the characters were set, he was brought on to rewrite some dialogue, especially regarding Batman. And well Batfleck was pretty much the best part of this movie, killing spree aside. That movie ended up being what it was because of massive cuts and bad direction.

Justice League same thing, Whedon rewrote a lot of the script and Terrio wrote what was supposed to be a 2 part movie initially. Again, the studio messed it up, reshoots, rewrites, cuts, 2h mandate, etc. So much drama. 

And Terrio is responsible for these great lines in BVS, amongst others:

""Oh, yes it has, sir. Everything's changed. Men fall from the sky, the gods hurl thunderbolts, innocents die. That's how it starts. The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men... cruel.""

""Men are still good. We fight, we kill, we betray one another. But we can rebuild. We can do better. We will. We have to."" (this is such a good line imo)

Plus he wrote Argo all by himself and got an Oscar. No studio meddling, no bad direction, no massive cuts...

Imagine great dialogue like this with a great story if JJ can pull it off. Especially with fascinating and complicated characters like Kylo

Rey seems to house alot more genuine aggressiveness than Kylo who only destroys computers to ”proove” that he is totally dark side.
i feel that, through circumstances, they would trade lightsabers. Ben bassically says that: i will continue in my grandfathers footsteps. Not as a Darth, but as a skywalker. And he then gets Anakin`s old saber. While Rey is just pent up frustration and takes Kylo`s saber. Not that it holds any significance for her, she just needs a blade.
Rey isthe perfect apprentice for Snoke. She has no meaningful attachements such as parents for example. 

And think further back. Rey`s upbringing on Jakku would have been harsh, it would only make sense for her to get a sort of survival of the fittest attitude to life, while Ben is raised by loving parents and an awesome jedi uncle.

The closest and most sympathetic portrayal so far is probably Krennic in R1. Evil for sure, but not entirely unsympathetic - but again, this was very much in the context of a clear war movie (my fave, incidentally).

I get that SW is ultimately about the central conflict between Light and Dark, but this feels like this is an area they could explore more, a la Game of Thrones.

How would YOU make Episode IX?,"At the current state of the Star Wars saga, how would YOU, a fan, end this new trilogy?

Here's my idea for Ep IX:

ACT I - New rebellion.
The movie is set a good 5-6 years after TLJ. It opens with Finn (now a captain), some rebels, and Rey with a small group of force users, raiding a Convoy of First Order ships. They are there to rescue rebel prisioners. They are able to escape with he prisioners but they're forced to abandon the Millennium Falcon, Kylo Ren takes the Falcon as an relic in his collection of war memorabilia. Poe is now the general commanding the Rebellion. no one knows where Leia is. She just vanished. In this first act we find out that this new rebellion is strugling to find more rebels to join the cause, that Rey has started a new jedi order, filled with untrained force users she found across the galaxy. The First Order have conquered most the galaxy, but Hux still feel that Kylo Ren is not a good leader... Since he's more interested in collecting old jedi artifacts and hunting down Rey and her new jedi order. The first act ends with the rebels receiving a transmission with coordinates that was sent by General Leia.

ACT II - The gathering.
The rebellion fights their way through an First Order blockade to get to the coordinates in Leia's transmission. After a big space battle, they're able to reach a secret base on a small moon. There they find out that Leia died for a secret mission she'd been working on: Get various groups of the galaxy to have a secret meeting in this old rebel base, to negotiate the terms of the new republic, and form an aliance to fight the First Order in one massive atack. The last stand against this terrible evil. The groups are the Last remaining Mandalorians, The Corellian Smugglers, The mining Guild... We se leaders from all over tha galaxy joinning tha battle, all ready to fight in the hopes of becoming part of this new republic. Meanwhile, Hux is showing Kylo Ren the new First Order Dreadnaught.. A ship with enough firepower to destroy any rebel fleet.

ACT III - Battle Plans
The rebelion prepares for the attack... We find out that the rebellion intentionally let the Falcon be captured, knowing that it would be sent to Kylo Ren's collection. The Falcon has been emiting a signal to the rebellion, scanning and maping the Kylo Ren's castle in the First Orders home world. The rebels have a location to a generator inside the castle that will disable The first Order's Shields, and secure the victory.  Finn's squad, and Rey's force users are set to infiltrate the castle and destroy the generator, while Poe will command the last stand of the republic in an epic space battle. Luke's ghost appear to Rey, warning her that she won't be a jedi til she defeat Kylo Ren.

ACT IV - Last Flight of The Falcon
The attack starts, is an epic battle... Finn's Squad fight their way on the castle trying to reach the generator, while Rey and her force users battle Kylo Ren and the Knights of Ren. Rey defeats Kylo, but spares his life. She has defeated him, and has prooved that the lightside of the Force while Always prevail. She has become a Jedi. Hux takes this oportunity to stage a coup... He betrays Kylo and leaves him to die... Then Hux gets in the new first order Dreadnaught, to Destroy the rebel fleet. Finn and Rey are still trying to disable the shield generator... The first order is winning, it seems all is lost. when.... The ghosts of Anakin, Luke, Leia and Han Solo apear to an wounded Kylo Ren. They urge him to accpet who he is... Fulfill his destiny, put an end to the war. Kylo takes the Falcon (was still in his collection), and helps the rebels in the fight... Finn and Rey finally disable the generator, and to stop the Dreadnaught, Kylo sacrifices himself, ramming the Falcon in the Ion cannons of the enemy ship, overloading everything and causing an explosion that defeats the First Order.

[Spoilers] I think I’m starting to hate Star Wars,"Strap in friends, this is a long one. Not sure if it’s appropriate, or follows the rules but to be blatantly honest I need to vent and my family and friends aren’t really fans. 

For the first time in my life, I have negative feelings toward Star Wars. I grew up in an unstable home, but my respite was that galaxy far far away. No matter what was happening at home, I could turn on the movies, play the games and be transported away from my problems. As time went on, I finally found my footing but Star Wars remained a constant in my life. Even as soon as a year ago no matter what troubles or issues I was having, I could take five minutes and explore this sub to see all the cool theories and cosplay to brighten my mood. 

Well, leading up to the release of Star Wars Battlefront 2 (SWBF2) and The Last Jedi I was beyond hyped.  The first issue came when Electronic Arts decided to try to implement a mobile game monitization strategy with SWBF2. It was gross, egregious, greedy and broke the game. The fact that Disney made EA turn off being able to pay actual money for progression did nothing but expose the broken systems included in the game. Also, the game developers, DICE, were and remain completely unresponsive and are slow to fix or change anything. I’ve since traded in my copy for $14 and I feel like I was overpaid for it. Star Wars gaming has an amazing legacy with some of the best games ever made among its storied past. I’ve never traded a Star Wars game until now but I couldn’t wait to get it out of my house.

Then The Last Jedi happened. I saw it with my young daughter and really enjoyed it. Sure there were some sticking points but overall I liked the movie. I took my entire extended family to see the movie and overall the experience was good. But now, after some time to digest it I can’t help but feel like a huge part of the story was ended with little regard to the future. 

Luke is dead, the resistance is all but destroyed and I feel like Rey was less interesting than in TFA. It’s not that TLJ wasn’t very good in a vacuum but I feel somewhat robbed.  Luke was a hero of a generation and while I realize his story has been told and has ended I can’t help but feel that so much was taken off the table when he faded away. I loved the Force projection but did he really need to die?  Why not just severely weaken him so that he can still be a supporting character in the next movie. Plus, why wasn’t Ackbar kept alive?  Why did we need a new character who doesn’t even survive the movie in regard to Admiral Holdo?  Ackbar could have easily filled that role and it would have been so much more powerful as he’s making a huge sacrifice to save the last of the rebellion. I didn’t mind Canto Bight but it really did add very little. 

Then there is everything else. Again, I loved TLJ and my sole complaint is I feel like I didn’t get enough Luke and Rey. But the disgusting vitriol and back and forth that took place after the film has sickened me. On the one hand you have people calling Holdo “Admiral Gender Studies” which is not only disrespectful to a great actress but also shows an intolerance for perceived political agenda. Then the other end of that spectrum cannot stop throwing out the “virgin” and “parents basement” cliche and how everyone is a bigot or mysogynist which is disrespectful to a fan base that by and large made Star Wars what it is. Marginalizing each other, calling each other names and making straw men. 

Star Wars is no longer my refuge. All this fighting and bullshit has shown me that Star Wars is just like the rest of the world. Just as ugly, just as greedy, just as full of hatred and intolerance. 

I haven’t watch the original trilogy since a week after TLJ. I haven’t picked up any of my old games in awhile either. When I think about Star Wars now I get a sick feeling in my stomach. It’s tarnished, it’s ugly now. 

Thank you for reading.  If you didn’t like it I apologize. If you don’t like me, I don’t like you either. You just watch yourself.

Does Kylo know about Darth Vader killing all the younglings?,"Kylo reveres Darth Vader for being powerful and evil, but hates Luke because he thought he was trying to kill him in his sleep. Anakin did essentially the same thing to all the younglings, but worse since he doesn't stop like Luke did. Has Kylo heard Vader's story of murdering the helpless children who trusted him? And if he hadn't, would hearing about it make Kylo hate Vader for such a betrayal, respect him more for how brutal he was, or perhaps even respect Luke more for his similarity to his father?

Also, from Kylo's POV, Luke didn't stop himself, but was stopped by Kylo, who then sought immediate retribution by killing a bunch of fellow Jedi-in-training. Maybe knowledge of Darth Vader's actions would foster more kinship, as they seemed to have a similar response to feeling they were betrayed?",StarWars,True,1519414274,2018-02-23
Anakin's lightsaber in TFA and TLJ,"So in TFA when Rey and Kylo are fighting in the snow they both call the lightsaber to them. But it goes to Rey this time.

In TLJ Rey tries to get if from Kylo's hands when she rejects his offer to rule, then Kylo tires to get it back so they are both calling the lightsaber to them. But this time it does not go to Rey or Kylo. It breaks in half.

What is your interpretation of this scene? the force is more balanced, in TFA it was not and Rey needed a push? The force wants them working together, not apart so that's why the saber broke in half?

This scene for me just shows that the storyline is going towards looking for balance in the force and rebirth in the way the galaxy works but who knows.

Any other interpretations of this scene? Id love to know. Thanks!",StarWars,True,1519414532,2018-02-23
[Showerthought] Jedi/Sith use lightsabers because they are so cool that they can bring a knife to a gunfight,"If you watch Indiana Jones: Raider of the Lost Arks, you know that part of the movie when the swordsman tried to show off with his cool sword tricks just to be shot dead right away by Indiana Jones. And in Star Wars: A New Hope, Han Solo (also played by Harrison Ford) said ""Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid"". 

Using lightsaber itself is a display of power. Like whoa these motherfuckers must be really good to fight against deadly robots/soldiers with a storm of lasers coming in to fry your ass with a fucking sword. Force users have a lot of ways to attack their opponents from a decent range without engaging in close combat with lightsabers. Force choke, force push, force pull, etc. Hell Kylo Ren can stop a fucking laser in the air. You can just deflect all those lasers back to the enemy. Sith Lords could shoot lightnings from their hands all day and choke people but they still whip out their lightsaber.",StarWars,True,1519414836,2018-02-23
Are the books canon or not cannon?,"Okay y’all I’ve seen this question thrown a lot lately. I’ve first noticed it when I was watching John campea and he explained how in TLJ poe says “I’m poe.” And Rey says “I’m Rey.” As if they just met.

**STAR WARS**

**EPISODE IX**

**A NEW ORDER**

-

The galaxy lives in fear. The ruthless FIRST ORDER have invaded countless systems, enrolling their citizens in the military and enslaving those who oppose.

General Leia Organa and her RESISTANCE have hidden from the First Order on a secret new base as they slowly rebuild and gain more allies to help bring an end to the First Order’s reign of terror.

Rey, the last Jedi, has ventured off to learn more about the ways of the force. In hopes to find her, Kylo Ren has dispatched his loyal KNIGHTS OF REN to search for Rey and bring her to him….

---

**TL;DR**

* The First Order invades Coruscant as part of their plan to control the core worlds of the galaxy.

* Leia's death and funeral help bring the galaxy together. Different smaller factions throughout the galaxy come together to join the Resistance and bring down the First Order, including Lando.

* Hux tries to kill Kylo, but Kylo is one step ahead and kills him. This sends the First Order into chaos, some are loyal to Hux, others are loyal to Kylo. The First Order splits and starts killing each other.

* Rey, Finn, and Rose fight the Knights of Ren, Rose dies in the fight. And Chewie saves the day.

* Rey and Kylo fight in the old Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Rey ends up saving Ben/Kylo and doesn't kill him.

* During the battle, a star destroyer gets hit and comes crashing down to the Jedi Temple. Together, Rey and Ben use the force to stop the star destroyer from crashing and killing the entire Resistance. Ben sacrifices himself so that Rey and the Resistance can escape, Ben fades away and the star destroyer comes crashing into the temple as the Resistance flies away.

* Chewie takes the Falcon and goes back home to Kashyyyk.

* Ben, Luke, and Anakin meet in the force/nether world. Talk about how the Skywalkers have caused distress in the galaxy for a long time and that their story is over, it's time for the galaxy to move on and make way for something new.

* Connix becomes the chancellor of the new New Republic, Poe becomes the General for their military with Finn being his right-hand man, and Rey starts a new Jedi order.

**Act I**

*Exterior. Space.*

Pan down to a small ship above a planet. Inside is a Knight of Ren piloting, his tracker starts blinking, its found life on the planet below, he flies down to it and lands next to a mountain with a cave entrance. It’s a Jedi temple.

The planet is called ‘Nataara’. It’s barren and covered with large mountains, there’s heavy fog, large dead trees, and dead yellow grass covered with weeds.

The Knight exits his ship and looks at his tracker, at the cave entrance, and back at his tracker. Exits the cave is a hooded figure. The Knights yells at it to halt. The figure keeps walking. The Knight pulls out his blaster and yells, “i’ll shoot!” The figure keeps walking. The Knight shoots as the figure ignites a blue lightsaber and blocks the blast, it comes out of the shadows and removes its hood, it’s Rey. 
“Just let me go and I won’t hurt you” Rey says.

The Knight laughs as he pulls out a lightsaber and ignites it, its red. “You’re not going anywhere”.

“Oh no”, Rey says as she takes stance and ignites the other side of her dual-blade lightsaber.

The Knight charges towards Rey they clash lightsabers and they fight. After a short fight, Rey easily disarms the Knight and stabs him through the chest. Rey walks towards her starfighter as R2 beeps saying she’s getting a call from the resistance base. She answers and it’s Finn. 

“Finn!?! They found me, I don’t know how, but they found me.”

“Are you okay?!”

“Yes, I was able to get rid of one of Kylo’s Knights, but he had a tracker on him so more of them are probably on their way. Wait, why are you calling me?”

“It’s Leia… You need to come back.”

-

*Cut to the new resistance base.*

It’s a very Earth-like planet, green grass and trees, lots of rivers and valleys.

We see a coffin with people carrying it to the top of a hill with resistance troopers lined up along the hill.
Pan to the resistance base hanger where we see Poe, Finn, and Chewie go out to greet Rey as she gets out of her ship.

“Rey!” Finn says as Chewie runs up to hug her.

“What happened?” Rey says barely able to get the words out.

“We were-”

“Who’s that?” Finn cuts off Poe and points to a ship that’s landing at the base.

The ship lands, a ramp comes down and out comes Lando Calrissian in a hovering wheelchair.

“How you doin’ Chewbacca?”

“Lando! So glad you could make it.” Poe says.

“Who is this guy?” Finn says to Poe quietly.

“This is Lando Calrissian, Rebel hero and friend of the resistance.” Poe says.

“Leia and I go way back. As you can see, I’m not quite as physically capable as I used to be so I’ve been out of the fight for a while, but I needed to say one last goodbye to our princess.”

“Rrawrgh”

“It’s good to see you too Chewbacca”

During the funeral Poe and Connix talk about important she was to the resistance and the galaxy as a whole and how they must carry on her legacy and bring and end to the First Order’s Reign.

-

*Cut to the interior of a Star Destroyer.*

Kylo Ren is standing on the bridge looking out of the window at all the other star destroyers in the First Order fleet. Hux walks up to him.

“The attack on the Resistance command ship was successful, Supreme Leader. General Organa is dead.” Hux says proudly

Kylo is silent. He looks conflicted and sad.

“Good. Have my Knights reported back yet?” Kylo says flatly

“All but one.”

“He’s dead.”

“What?!”

“He found her. He found her and she killed him. Why else would he be absent?”

“So this whole search has been a waste!” Hux starts to get more frustrated.

“I need to find her!”

“You should be spending your time and resources bringing an end to the Resistance instead of chasing some girl!”

“You take orders from me!” Kylo force chokes Hux and throws him against the wall.

A First Order officer approaches Kylo, looking terrified.

“Supreme Leader, your shuttle is ready.”

“Good.”

“Where are you going?” Hux says from the floor, gasping for air.

“This doesn’t concern you.” Kylo says walking away

“Lieutenant, send a team to that Knights last known location.” Kylo says to the First Order officer

“Yes, sir.”

Kylo’s shuttle takes off from the star destroyer and warps into hyperspace. 

-

*Cut back to the Resistance base.*

“So what do we do know?” Finn says in defeat.

“We make sure Leia’s death wasn’t in vein.” Poe says strongly.

“With what? A few X-Wings, the Falcon, and a single transport? And now we have no leader. How do we bring down the First Order with this?”

“Don’t be so quick to judge, Lieutenant.” Connix says walking up to Finn. “It turns out Leia was able to save us one last time.”

“What do you mean?” Says Finn

“Leia’s been in communication with other systems throughout the galaxy for a while now. If we find out where the First Order is, I think we could convince them to join us in a final attack against the First Order, for Leia.”

“How are we supposed to find where the main First Order fleet is? They’re spread throughout the whole galaxy.” Poe says

“Wait, Rey, if you went back to the temple on Nataara and looked through the navigation logs of the ship that found you, wouldn’t you be able to find out where it came from?” Finn says

“Finn, that’s brilliant! There’s only one problem, that planet is probably covered with stormtroopers by now.” Rey says

“Chewie and I will come with you.”

“Finn, it’s going to be dangerous.”

“I know, that’s why you’re not going alone.”

“I’ll get Rose to prepare the ships, and you report back as soon as you find out where they are.” Poe says

Rey, Finn, Chewie, and R2 get into the Millenium Falcon and take off.

-

*Cut back to Kylo’s shuttle.*

We see it arrive on Mustafar where it lands at Vader’s castle. Kylo exits the shuttle with the five remaining Knights of Ren behind him, one is carrying Vader’s mask. Kylo walks into Vader’s headquarters, grabs the mask and sets it on a mantle.

“Let the past die, and let a new order rise. No Jedi, no Sith. Kill it all.”

Kylo walks away, “arm the explosives”, he orders his men.

Kylo gets in his shuttle and flys away. Vader’s castle explodes in the distance.

-

*Cut to the interior of the Millenium Falcon.*

“Careful Chewie, don’t pull out of hyperspace too close. If anyone’s there we don’t want to show up on their radar.” Rey says
They pull out of hyperspace and you can see Nataara in the distance.

“R2, scan for any life forms on the planet.”

“Beep boop beep”

Rey sighs, “there’s a strong reading. They’re already there.”

“What do we do?” Finn says

“Chewie, fly down to planet but don’t get too low. We’ll show up on their radar but the fog will block them from actually seeing us.” Rey says

The Falcon flies down to the planet and hides in its thick atmosphere. Rey goes to the back of the ship and opens the door.

“Rey? What are you doing?” Finn says in a worried voice

“Get ready to jump.”

“What?!? But we don’t have jetpacks!”

“Just jump!” Rey grabs Finn and throws him up and out of the Falcon as he screams. “And be quiet!”

Rey then jumps out quickly after. Finn flails falling while Rey dives down to the ground. As she gets closer to the ground Rey uses the force to force push against the ground and land safely. Rey looks up and sees Finn falling, she uses the force to slow him down and catch him.

“Why did you do that?! Finn says panting and freaking out

“Shhh! Quiet, they’re going to hear us!” Rey says quietly, covering Finn’s mouth

Finn and Rey take cover behind a First order transport. There is one transports, two landed tie fighters, and about fifteen stormtroopers around the Knights abandoned ship and temple entrance with several more scattered around the area.

“We need to get to that ship over there” Rey says pointing to the Knights ship being surrounded by stormtroopers

“Great.” Finn says sarcastically

“We need a distraction, you get to the ship and I’ll keep them busy.”

“Rey, no! There’s too many of them!”

“Finn! We-”

Suddenly the Millenium Falcon swoops down above the stormtroopers and quickly flies away. Chewie yells from the cockpit with a Porg beside him.

“That’s her! After that ship!” A stormtrooper yells, as all the troopers run away to their ships and chase after the Falcon.

“That’ll do it.” Finn says, as him and Rey run towards the Knights ship. Finn and Rey enter the ship and go through the navigation log and find out where the ship came from. Finn then calls Poe on his coms link.

“Finn! Did you find out where the First Order fleet is?”

“The ship came from a point out in wild space. I’m sending you the coordinates now.”

“Great! Get back here as fast as you can, we’re going to need every man we have.”

“You got it, buddy!”

Finn and Rey exit the ship and look to the skies.

“Where’s Chewie?” Rey says

Finn and Rey hear tie fighter screeches and blaster sounds from the sky but can’t see anything. Suddenly the Falcon flies down out of the fog with two tie fighters trailing behind him. Rey waves her arms in air to signal Chewie, and her and Finn start running towards the Falcon. The Falcon swoops down close to the ground and opens the doors. Rey force throws Finn onto the ramp and Rey jumps up after him. “Punch it Chewie!” she yells, as Chewie speeds up and flies back into the fog. Rey and Finn both go into the gunner positions and shoot down the tie fighters then Chewie flies away and warps into hyperspace.

---

**Act II**

*Cut to the interior of a star destroyer.*

Hux is standing on the bridge looking out the window. Kylo Ren walks in.

“You’ve returned just in time, Supreme Leader, the fleet is fully prepared to leave for our invasion.”

“What did your search team find?”

“Unfortunately, they were killed.”

“Aaaargh!!!” Kylo screams as he throws his lightsaber across the room cutting off the head of a stormtrooper that was passing by.

“Supreme Leader, there are more important things at hand.”

“I don’t care about your stupid invasion! I want the girl.”

“We need all our resources for the invasion for when the Resistance shows up, I can’t have you take more men and ships to go off on a blind hunt!”

“The Resistance” Kylo says as though he’s pondering something

“Yes, the Resistance. You think they won’t hear about what we’re doing and try to stop us?” Hux says

“They’ll bring everything they have.”

“Exactly.”

“Including Rey.”

Hux sighs and rolls his eyes, looking annoyed and frustrated.

“Prepare the fleet for lightspeed!” Kylo yells eagerly

-

*Cut to the exterior of the Resistance base.*

The Millennium Falcon lands and Finn, Rey, Chewie, and R2 exit as Poe runs up to them.

“You’re back! I’ll get Lieutenant Connix to send out the message to the other systems for backup and we can be on our way.” Poe says

Cut to the interior of the Resistance base.

“Lieutenant, it’s time to-” Poe gets abruptly cut off

“Commander! Commander!” A low ranking Resistance officer yells running up to Poe

“What is it?” Poe asks

“We’re getting reports that the First Order has invaded Coruscant!”

“Coruscant?!”

“Yes, sir. The citizens have sent out a distress signal. They’ve taken over the old Jedi temple, enslaved the civilians.”

“There’s over a trillion people on Coruscant! We can’t let the First Order occupy it!” Finn says

“If what you’re telling me is true then we have no time to waste, we have to move now! Connix, it’s time to send out that message to the other systems, we’re going to need all the help we can get.” Poe says

“Actually, Poe, I think we have someone who is much better suited for that.” Connix says looking at Lando.

“This is Lando Calrissian of the Resistance. For far too long we lived in fear of the First Order, letting them take control of the galaxy by destroying and enslaving the systems within it. And now they have destroyed the galaxy’s last spark of hope, Princess Leia. Today I ask of you to join us in bringing down the First Order and restoring peace to the galaxy in one final, all out, attack against our oppressors. For Leia.”

-

*Cut to Coruscant. Exterior.*

Star destroyers loom in the sky, there’s fire in the streets as stormtroopers and AT-ST’s march down them, you can hear faint screams of panic from the citizens.

Cut to the interior of the old Jedi temple on Coruscant.

Hux and Kylo stand in the old Jedi Council Chamber looking out the window at the First Order taking over the city.

“Once we control the core worlds, the galaxy will be ours.” Hux says with a smirk on his face

“Are there any signs of the Resistance yet?” Kylo asks

“Not yet, but they’ll be here any moment and we can finally bring an end to their pathetic rebelion. Their small fleet stands no chance against us.”

Cut to the interior of a First Order star destroyer in space above Coruscant.

“Commander, still no trace of any Resistance ships in the area.”

“Prepare the ventral cannons, they’ll be here soon, I know it.”

Cut to the exterior.

There are several star destroyers lined up, eagerly awaiting the Resistance. Suddenly Resistance ships warp out of hyperspace in front of the star destroyers. There are about fifteen x-wings, Rey’s starfighter, the millennium falcon, and one transport ship behind them.

Cut to the interior of the millennium falcon.

“That’s a lot of star destroyers!” Finn says leaning over Chewie’s shoulder looking out the window

“Your friends better get here soon!” Rose says talking to Lando

“All we can do is hope.” Lando says

“I’ve got a bad feeling about this.” Finn says

Cut to the interior of Poe’s ship.

“Alright, all wings behind me! Chewie, Lando, you keep that transport safe!” Poe says as he spins off towards the star destroyers.
Tons of tie fighters fly out of the star destroyers and charge towards the Resistance ships as the star destroyers open fire. The x-wings dodge fire while Poe and Rey blow up a few tie fighters. BB-8 (in Poe’s ship) and R2 (in Rey’s ship) beep and boop excitedly.

“We gotta create an opening for the transport so we can get our troops on the ground! All wings start a bombing run the on that big destroyer in the middle, behind me! Poe says

The ships fly in close to the destroyer, bombing it. A couple x-wings get blown up by the destroyers cannons.

“We’re not going to be able to bring down that thing by ourselves. Come on, our backup better be here soon!” Poe says

Suddenly dozens of ships warp out of hyperspace at Coruscant, some large ships, some small, all different types.

“Haha, I knew they’d show up!” Lando says

All the ships charge towards the destroyers as more tie fighters come out.

Cut back to the interior of the old Jedi temple.

A hologram appears in front of Hux.

“General, the Resistance brought back up. Our ships are taking heavy fire.”

“Aaaaghh, do I have to do everything myself!” Kylo yells as he quickly walks out of the room

Cut back to the action in space.

The Resistance and their friends are taking heavy losses but they’re doing a lot of damage to the destroyers. Kylo Ren then appears in his ship and starts shooting down x-wings. He flies directly behind Rey and targets her ship, sensing that it’s her he pulls his finger off the trigger, rolls away goes after Poe’s ship. Poe flies in towards the large destroyer that is almost destroyed while Kylo trails him.

“Poe, Kylo’s on your tail! You have to pull out!” Rey yells

“I’m almost there! One more shot and this things going down!” Poe yells back to her

Poe targets the engines of the destroyer and fires then is immediately hit by Kylo sending him spiraling down towards the planet. However, Poe’s shot hit the destroyer, shutting down it’s engines making it slowly fall down to the planet.

“There’s our opening! Protect the transport!” Lando says in excitement

All the Resistance ships quickly fly through the opening in the First Order’s blockade, going down to the surface of the planet. The Millenium Falcon flies towards where Poe’s ship crash landed. Finn runs out as soon as the falcon lands, running towards Poe’s ship. BB-8 is still locked in and makes a few sad beeps. Finn opens the cockpit to see Poe sitting there, he has some blood on his face. Finn pulls him out as Rose and Chewie run out to help. “Poe! Poe!” Finn yells trying to wake him up. Poe then gasps and jumps up.
 
“Finn?!” Poe says

“Poe!” Finn says

“BB-8!” Poe says, as he gets up and runs towards his ship, he takes BB-8 out, he’s all right.

“I’m so glad you’re okay!” Poe says hugging BB-8.

-

Cut to the Resistance transport and other ships as they land in front of the old Jedi temple, several blocks away. The transport doors open and a bunch of Resistance troopers march out and line up behind Rey along with all the people they called for backup. They face down a large line of stormtroopers several blocks away in front of the temple. The Millennium Falcon lands, dropping off Poe and BB-8, then taking off again with Chewie and Lando piloting and with Rose and Finn in the gunner seats.

“Kylo’s in that temple, I can sense him. If you can get me to him, I can bring an end to all of this.” Rey says

“You heard her. I know it’s not going to be easy, but we have to get her to that temple, it’s the only way we can bring down the First Order, from the top-down.” Poe says turned around facing all the troops.

The Resistance troopers start to charge towards the temple firing at the stormtroopers. The stormtroopers are firing back along with two massive turrets near the entrance of the temple. The turrets are taking out large numbers of the Resistance troopers.

“We have to take out those turrets!” Rey yells

“Rraawrgh!” Chewie yells from the falcon cockpit as Finn and Rose fire at the First Order turrets from the falcon gunner seats

“Our guns aren’t doing much against those turrets shields!” Finn yells

“We’re going to have to get in closer!” Poe says

“Maybe not!” Rey says as she grabs a grenade from Poe and force throws it to the turrets, destroying their shields.

The Millenium Falcon then swoops down and shoots at the turrets again this time blowing them up.

“Yeehaw!” Lando yells

-

*Cut to the interior of the old Jedi Council Chamber.*

“The Resistance are making progress towards the temple.” Hux says looking out the window as Kylo is kneeling on the other side of the room, meditating.

“Good. Rey should be here any moment now.” Kylo says

“Good?! Killing one girl won’t bring an end to Resistance!” Hux says turning around, fuming in anger

“I don’t want to kill her.”

“Don’t let your personal feelings get in the way of the job at hand, Ren!”

Hux gets more angry and slowly grabs his blaster as Kylo is still facing away from him, Hux then slowly starts to walk towards Kylo.

“You want to know the truth about what happened with Supreme Leader Snoke? I killed him. He got in between me and Rey, so I killed him.” Kylo says

Hux slowly moves his blaster up to right behind Kylo’s head.

“I know.” Hux says as he clutches his finger around the trigger

Hux then gets thrown across the room and into the wall being force choked by Kylo. Kylo slowly gets up, turns around, and walks towards Hux as Hux is still in the air being force choked.

“And now, I’m going to kill you too.” Kylo says tightening his grip around Hux’s throat.

Hux gasps for air and then dies still suspended in the air. Kylo drops Hux and looks at him as Vader’s theme plays slowly. 

-

*Cut back to the exterior of the temple.*

The Resistance continues to charge forward taking down stormtroopers while losing soldiers of their own. Finally they defeat all of the stormtroopers and make it to the front of the temple. But as they start running up the steps of temple, a few tie fighters fly up behind them catching the Millenium Falcon off guard and shoot it down. The Falcon comes crashing down beside the Resistance troopers. It’s still in tact but it’s not flyable anymore. Finn, Rose, and C3PO come out with Chewie carrying Lando in his arms. Chewie sets Lando down on the ground and wookie screams. Lando didn’t make it. A couple First Order transports land behind the Resistance, stormtroopers start marching out as three AT-ST’s come around the corner and walk towards the Resistance.

“Go! We’ll hold ‘em off!” Poe yells to Rey

**Act III**

*Cut to the interior of the Jedi temple.*

Kylo walks into old Jedi holocron archives, it’s all empty except for one holocron. Kylo walks up to it, picks it up, taps into the light side of the force, and opens it. It’s Anakin. Kylo looks at the holocron as tears start streaming from his eyes. 

-

*Cut to the temple entrance.*

Rey, Finn, and Rose run up the steps and into the temple as the rest of the Resistance fires at the stormtroopers. Rey, Finn, and Rose enter the front doors of the temple and a few stormtroopers are standing there with those melee baton things (TR-8R weapon). Rey strikes one with her lightsaber as she force pushes the other two to the ground knocking them out. They start to run forward again but suddenly the Knights of Ren walk in and ignite their lightsabers. There are five of them. Finn and Rose both look terrified. Finn and Rose bend over and pick up the melee batons from the stormtroopers. The Knights then charge at them. Rey takes on three of the Knights at once while Finn and Rose both take on one each. Rey kills one of the Knights but Rose is struggling. Rose gets knocked down and is then stabbed through the chest, killing her. Finn screams “No!” and smashes the Knight that killed her across the face, knocking him out. Rey kills another Knight while Finn continues to fight with one. There are now two left. Finn gets knocked down and one Knight is about the slay Finn. Rey sees this, twists her dual-bladed lightsaber, separating it into two lightsabers and throws one at Finn. Finn catches the lightsaber and stabs the Knight through the chest right before the Knight is able to hit him. Rey, being focused on Finn, loses focus and the last Knight get the jump on her and holds his lightsaber up to her throat. The Knight laughs. Suddenly, a blaster bolt comes out of nowhere and hits the Knight in the head, throwing him across the room. It’s Chewie standing there in the entrance with his crossbow.

*Cut back to the exterior of the temple.*

The Resistance are still fighting the First Order in front of the temple.

-

*Cut back to the jedi archives room.*

Kylo pulls out his comlink and starts a holochat with a commander stormtrooper on the streets in front of the temple.

“Commander, stop the attack.” Kylo orders his soldier

“Excuse me, supreme leader? We have the Resistance cornered, we can put an end to them right now.” the commander says confused

“I said stop!”

“I don’t think General Hux would approve of this.”

“Hux is dead! Send the message out to the other officers.”

“Yes, sir.” the commander says in a scared voice. 

Cut to the exterior of the temple.

“Halt fire!” he yells at the other stormtroopers

“What are you doing commander?! We have them cornered!” a captain says to the commander

The commander pulls up his com link and starts recording a message

“General Hux is dead, all soldiers are to stop all assaults immediately.”

“What?! We are not stopping this close to a victory!” the captain says

“Supreme Leaders orders.”

“You’re taking orders from Ren?! He doesn’t care about the First Order!”

“I am your commander, stand down!”

“I’m not letting the Resistance get away!”

“What you’re suggesting is treason!”

The captain raises his blaster and shoots the commander

“All men, fire!” the captain yells

“Commander!” a random stormtrooper yells

Some stormtroopers resume shooting at the Resistance as others shoot at the captain. The squadron of troops becomes split and start shooting at each other, with one side being loyal to their Supreme Leader, and the other being loyal to the First Order.

-

*Cut back to the temple entrance.*

Rey and Chewie walk over and help Finn up.

“Are you okay?” Rey asks

Finn looks to his side to see Rose lying there.

“I’m so sorry.” Rey says

Finn gets down on his knees and kisses Rose on the forehead.

“You need to go.” Finn says without taking his eyes off Rose

“Finn-”

“Go! I’ll be fine.”

Rey nods and runs off into the temple.

-

*Cut to the interior of a star destroyer.*

A First Order officer is receiving the message the now dead commander sent.

“General Hux is dead, all soldiers are to stop all assaults immediately. Supreme Leaders orders.”

“Lieutenant, send out a squadron of fighters to the temple. And destroy it.” the admiral says

“Admiral, did you not hear the message?” the lieutenant says

“I heard it, loud and clear.”

The First Order continues to fight with each other. Tie fighters are shooting at each other, stormtroopers are killing each other, star destroyers are crashing into each other.

-

*Cut back to the interior of the temple.*

Rey is wandering the halls of the library, she can sense Kylo is near but not sure exactly where.

“Are you here to kill me?” Kylo says standing behind Rey

“I’m here to bring an end to this war.” Rey says turning around

“I don’t want this, I order my troops to stop.”

A tie fighter comes crashing through a window of the temple, there’s an explosion and you can hear lots of gunfire from outside.

“It sure doesn’t sound like it.”

“Please Rey, join me. Together we can start a new order and bring an end to this war.”

“I’m not joining you Ben, I’m trying to save you. Come with me and the Resistance will let you live.”

“As a prisoner!”

“It’s better than the alternative!”

“Not if you join me.” Kylo holds out his hand

“Don’t make me do this Ben.” a tears slides down Rey’s cheek

“Don’t turn on me Rey, you’re all I have.”

“I gave you a chance.” Rey says igniting her lightsabers

“Traitor!” Kylo says igniting his lightsaber

They charge towards each other and clash lightsabers. A new version of ‘Dual of the Fates’ plays. 

“I should have known you’d turn against me!” Kylo says as they fight “It’s the Jedi way.”

“You turned against yourself.”

Kylo knocks one of the lightsabers out of Rey’s hands. Rey uses the force to grab it mid air, turn it back on, and throw it at Kylo. Kylo dodges it and then grabs the hilt, wielding it himself Kylo takes stance with one Red lightsaber and one blue, representing his split between the light and dark side. Rey grabs her remaining saber with both hands and charges at him.

-

*Cut back to the exterior of the temple.*

Finn walks out with a blaster in his hands and Chewie by his side and sees chaos. Stormtroopers shooting each other, First Order and the Resistance shooting each other, tie fighters are crashing down in the streets, there’s fire everywhere. Finn is shocked.

“Poe!” Finn yells as he runs down the steps and takes cover beside him

“Finn!” Poe says excitedly. “Where’s Rose?”

Finn looks down with a sad look.

“I’m so sorry.” Poe says

“What’s going on?”

“I’m assuming Rey has something to do with this. The First Order just started tearing itself apart.”

Suddenly a First Order transport comes crashing down at the entrance of the temple behind the Resistance. Stormtroopers come out and start shooting at the Resistance as they walk backwards into the temple.

-

*Cut back to the interior of the temple.*

Rey and Kylo are still fighting.

Rey knocks Kylo’s lightsaber out of his hand. Kylo swings for Rey’s head with his other lightsaber and Rey force pushes Kylo down to ground holding her lightsaber to his throat.

“I’m sorry Ben, you leave me no choice.” Rey says crying

“I love you.” Kylo says from the ground

“I know.” Rey says as she tightens her grip around her lightsaber and winds up to strike Kylo down. Suddenly a bunch of stormtroopers march in and completely surround Rey and Kylo.

“Captain, we’ve found Ren! And the Jedi!” a stormtrooper says

“Open fire. On both of them.” the captain says

All of the stormtroopers pull up their blasters and fire at Rey and Kylo.

“Nooooo!!!” Rey yells as she drops her lightsabers and pulls up her arms. All of the Blaster bolts suddenly freeze in the air in front of her and Kylo. Kylo looks up at her in shock. Rey pushes the blaster bolts back outwards killing all of the stormtroopers. Rey holds out her hand to Kylo and helps him up. Kylo then pulls her towards him and they kiss.

-

*Cut back to the exterior of the temple.*

There’s still chaos, and the Resistance are starting to get cornered. Suddenly the First Order transport in front of the temple get tossed up and lands on a few stormtroopers. Rey and Kylo stand there at the top of the steps. Kylo ignites his lightsaber and Rey twists her two sabers together and ignites her double-bladed lightsaber.

“Rey! Kylo?!” Finn says confused

“Rraaawrgh!” Chewie yells

Rey and Kylo charge forward deflecting blaster bolts and and slicing up stormtroopers. Together with the Resistance troops they kill all of the stormtroopers. Finn goes up and hugs Rey while giving Kylo a weird look through the corner of his eye.

“Rraawrgh!” Chewie yells as he walks up to Ben

Chewie is at first filled with rage remembering the sight of Ben killing his best friend. But then he’s reminded of all the time he spent with Ben when he was young.

“Chewie, I-” Ben says as he’s cut off by Chewie hugging him

Everyone else keeps their distance from Ben though as they know him for the stone-cold killer he once was.

Suddenly a loud crashing noise is heard as everyone looks up and sees a small star destroyer crashing down to the surface right towards them.

“We’ve gotta get out of her, now!” Rey says

“The Falcon’s wrecked, and it’s our only way out of here.” Poe says

“Chewie, get in there and try to fix it! Fast!” Rey yells

Rey and Ben look at each other and take stance as they raise their arms in the air. The star destroyer is getting closer as it comes down nose first right at them. Rey and Ben scream as they try to use the force to slow it down, you can see their feet getting pushed back. 

“We’ve got it!” Finn says running out of the Falcon as he looks up at the sky in shock

The star destroyer starts to slow down as it gets closer and closer and then eventually stops in the air with Rey and Ben holding it, still screaming.

“Get out of here! Now!” Rey screams

Finn and everyone runs into the Falcon and it slowly lifts off the ground.

“Rey!” Finn yells from the Falcon ramp as its about to take off.

“Go.” Ben says to Rey

Rey looks over at Ben.

“Please.” Ben says

Rey drops her arms and jumps onto the Falcon, turns and looks back at Ben as he looks at her, clearly struggling to hold up the star destroyer. The Falcon door closes and it flies away.

Ben is still lifting up the star destroyer, you can see he’s starting to get weak. Ben slowly start to fade away and suddenly disappears as the star destroyer comes crashing down, destroying the temple. 

The camera pans up and you can see the city is completely destroyed there are a bunch of crashed star destroyers in the streets. Everything’s on fire, smoke everywhere. But it’s silent. No blaster fire, no tie fighters screeching. Just silence and the crackling of fire. The First Order is destroyed and the war is over.

-

*Cut to the Resistance base.*

The Resistance troopers are celebrating.

Rey, Finn, Poe, Connix, Chewie, BB-8, C3PO, and R2 are gathered by the Falcon.

“I’m going to miss you Chewie.” Rey says

Chewie walks onto the ramp of the Falcon, stops, and turns around.

“Rraawrgh.” Chewie whimpers

Everyone runs up to Chewie and hugs him, including C3PO. Chewie bends down and pats R2 on the head.

“Rraawrgh.” Chewie says as he turns around and walks into the Falcon.

The door closes and the ship lifts off.

-

*Cut to Kashyyyk.*

The Falcon appears out of the sky and flies down to a hut in the trees. Chewie is home.

-

*Cut to Ben standing in a dark area.*

He looks confused, not sure where he is. Suddenly a bright light appears in front of him it starts to get brighter and brighter as it gets closer to him. The light fades away and Luke is standing there in front of Ben.

“Luke?” Ben says

“She did it. She really did it.” Luke says with a smile on his face

“What’s happening? Where are am I?”

“We’re in the netherworld. I told you I’d always be there with you... It’s good to have you back, Ben.” Luke says as he hugs Ben

Another white light appears to side, it gets closer and fades away. It’s Anakin.

“Hello, Ben.” Anakin says

“Grandfather?” Ben says

“I’ve been watching you Ben. And now thanks to you and Rey, the force has balance.” Anakin says

“The war is over, the galaxy can finally live in peace.” Ben says

“It doesn’t work like that Ben, nothing lasts forever.” Luke says

“The Skywalkers have caused distress in the galaxy for a long time. But now our story is over. It’s time for the galaxy to move on, and make way for something new.” Anakin says

-

*Cut to Coruscant.*

Poe and Connix stand in an office.

“Are you ready for your speech, Chancellor?” Poe asks

“I don’t think i’ll ever be ready.” Connix says

“I know you’re the right person for the job. Leia always spoke very highly of you, and she had every right to.”

Connix looks up at Poe and smiles.

“You know Poe, Rey’s training the new Jedi Order but we’re still going to need a general for our new military. A true leader.”

“Me?”

“Who else?”

“On one condition. Finn’s gotta be my right hand man.”

“Of Course.”

They smile at each other and walk out the door which leads to balcony over the city. There are tonnes of people cheering.

Cut to the exterior of Coruscant.

Rey is standing at the back of the crowd with Finn. Ben appears as a force ghost in front of Rey. They smile at each other.

“What are you looking at?” Finn asks

“Nothing.” Rey says smiling

Can they cover Snoke's backstory on screen without it being forced and unnecessary?,"I think it's possible, though I'm not sure we will see it (or even need to see it).  But if they do have Leia pass between TLJ and IX, then maybe IX can open with both the Resistance and the First Order celebrating the lives of their fallen leaders.  

Poe is giving a speech about Leia and all that she has done for the galaxy, while General Hux (or Kylo Ren, for the sake of irony) gives a speech about how Snoke ""saved"" the Imperial Remnant from total defeat.  And within that context, they can drop more information about who he was (still don't think it needs to be that in-depth or complex).

At the end of the day, I'm fine with him being a plot device who doesn't have his backstory fleshed out on screen.  I can just take him at face value.  But if your looking for a way to include it in a film, that might be okay.",StarWars,True,1519431399,2018-02-23

Did 3PO know?,"In *The Last Jedi*, Luke arrives on Crait to help the Resistance. However, it’s revealed that Luke never left Ahch-To, and projected himself across the galaxy in order to distract Kylo and the First Order while the Resistance escaped. Earlier, Luke sits down and talks with Leia, gives her a projection of the dice, and kisses her on the forehead. I think it’s been confirmed that when Luke touched her hand, Leia knew that he wasn’t really there. When Luke gets up to leave the base, he stops by C-3PO who says quite confused “Master Luke?”, who then winks at his old friend. We then see 3PO just keep his look on Luke. Do you think that 3PO knew that Luke wasn’t really there? I imagine, since he’s a droid, he’s able to detect stuff from living things. Do you think he didn’t detect anything and was like “what the hell is going on?!” On that note, how did 3PO see him?

What would you like to see in Rebels before it ends?,"I would really like to see them going into adventures and missions across the galaxy and show us once again of course more worldbuilding. The arc of Lothal we are currently seeing though has its value, it shows us the characters struggling together and the whole tension between them and Thrawn, as well as some emotional moments (RIP Kanan). But I really hope they eventually rise and do what they have to in other corners of the galaxy before the show ends. Since we know Ezra will at some point face the Emperor I think it's possible we see Coruscant again since it's there where the most powerful man of the galaxy lives. Idk, I just wanna see the big world (in this case galaxy) and the characters in it. 

EDIT: A cool idea would be including the rescue of Jyn Erso on Wobani right before it ends. It would be cool seeing this same mission, for example, in three different media (game, movie and TV show). Also I love the KX-series droids so bring them into the show :D ",StarWars,True,1519446462,2018-02-23
Yet another thing about The Last Jedi.,"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~IMHO~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(I need, like, an IMHO flair)

I know it's getting a bit exhausting talking about this film, but there's a small point of discussion I'd like to address.

Something I see often stated about The Last Jedi is that by the time it has finished pretty much nothing significant has happened plot-wise. While there has been significant character change and development, the actual story itself has arguably not 'moved forward' or even 'gone backwards.'

Examples include that the main battles are exclusively lost or end with the good guys running away, that Finn and Rose go on a mission which does nothing but ruin the rebel plan and bring about an 'unnecessary conflict.'

I hate to use constant comparisons with The Empire Strikes back, but here we are again.

In The Empire Strikes Back, there is one major battle, the result of which is defeat wherein the Rebels are forced to retreat. Nowhere in the film does the rebellion gain any sort of significant ground.

For the majority of the film, Han and Leia are on their own sidequest which contains a scene with weird alien bats and a space worm which really has no bearing on the plot at all. They just escape.

Additionally, the film ends with Luke losing the fight against Darth Vader, losing his hand, and jumping down an air shaft. His only victory is being rescued. While an extremely important character revelation has occurred, the 'wider plot' itself has not moved forward. Along with this, we need to bear in mind that at the time, before Jedi came out, Han Solo was as good as dead. A low point for everyone emotionally, and arguably if released today, it would be considered a lame or cheap cliffhanger.

I am not here to make any commentary on the quality of the film, which has been covered plenty in separate discussions all over this and other subreddits. However, I do with to oppose the criticism that The Last Jedi is somehow hurt by the fact that 'not much happened' in the grand scheme of things.
It just sort of gets my goat (not that anyone cares where my goat is) when someone says 'the thing that got me more than anything else was the fact that the whole movie was rendered meaningless in the last half hour!'.

There are better things to criticise.",StarWars,True,1519447352,2018-02-23

I just finished The Clone Wars for the first time.,"it was incredible. i had put off watching it for so long because i wasn’t sure if i wanted to commit to six seasons, but i’m watching everything star wars in chronological order and had to do it. i’m so glad i did. 

i’ve already ordered the Ahsoka and Dark Disciple novels. this show gives so much more depth to Star Wars. 

the final arc with Yoda’s journey makes me almost sad that there’s a sequel trilogy after the OT. Yoda’s line alluding to not having victory in the clone wars, but victory over all time with Luke makes me so sad that the First Order arises and undermines those final words of the series. 

anyway, i just wanted to say that it’s truly something. im so glad i finally got around to it. im off to watch episode iii now, and expecting much more depth. 

edit: and if anyone else is considering watching it, i’d highly recommend using [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/31ij0p/the_clone_wars_in_chronological_order_w_links_to/?st=JDJ90YMZ&amp;sh=fa0660e1) watch order. everything flowed together incredibly smoothly.

I really want Ben Solo to survive at the end.,"What's the point of building up this super interesting, complex and conflicted character for him to just die with no real impact on the saga and its future? This is Kylo and Rey's story after all and Rian even said  they're dual protagonists.

And even if he does somewhat redeem himself at the end by saving the Resistance/Rey or something, it doesn't mean he's forgiven by everyone for what he's done. Vader was redeemed in the eyes of Luke but the galaxy as a whole still hated him.

I also wouldn't want them to end the Skywalker saga on a negative note where he dies the villain. This whole saga was built upon the Skywalkers through the two previous trilogies, so are you really going to end that whole story in such a negative way?

What do you guys think?

Confusion as to Grievous origins,"I was watching the ""Star Wars Episode III: Creating General Grievous Webisode"" where they talk about all the design choices and how they where going to create this Droid general and all they had to go on was that he had to look evil.

I'm excited for Episode 9 for the reason I *should* have been excited for The Last Jedi.,"The Last Jedi, while hit-or-miss to both extremes of the spectrum, didn't *ruin* Star Wars for me, and I'm still very much looking forward to Episode 9. Why? It's very simple.

I have no idea what's going to happen with it.

With what The Force Awakens established and how the movie ended, everyone immediately started writing Episode 8 in their head. It was the first time a main-story Star Wars sequel was going to continue right where the previous left off, so fans were (for better or worse) given a rather tangible palette for speculation/theories. When more or less all of the speculation ultimately lead to naught, a lot of fans (even myself at times in the movie) felt like the rug was pulled from under them. Sure, you can poke fun at the fans for being too overly speculative and attached to their theories, but the truth of the matter is that The Force Awakens gave fans more concrete things to speculate about than any Star Wars film had before. 

The Last Jedi gave us really nothing like that. Of course, there'll still be plenty of speculation and theories, but it won't be based on what was objectively seen in the movie. So when Episode 9 comes along and a lot of speculation (inevitably) turns out wrong, there'll be less of a ""rug pulled"" feeling because the speculation was baseless.

I loved The Force Awakens, but how it set up The Last Jedi was a classic example of biting off more than it could chew. The Last Jedi, I'm polarized on, but I appreciate how it's giving Episode 9 a more ambiguous, clean slate to go off of.",StarWars,True,1518384139,2018-02-11

You are dropped in front of the Jedi Temple just as the Battle of Coruscant ends. Do you warn the jedi and save the republic or do you let things progress as they did in the movies.,"Legends or canon. And this is assuming that your knowledge of personal facts about the masters and war (such as Quinlin's mission or who purchased the clones) would get them to listen and that you could convince Yoda you were telling the truth. 

Would you warn them about the sith threat, about Order 66, and even about other dangers in the future (such as A'ashard Hett or the Vong). 

For me I'm kind of split. I am of the belief that its a good thing that the old Order fell. They were to corrupted by their 1000 year mission of making sure the sith never returned. It had blinded them to the light and led to them being more of a bureaucracy  than a jedi order. They are so blinded by the way things are done instead of why that they about send Obi-wan the greatest Knight of his generation to the Agri corps just because he was 13 and didn't have a master. 

The orders death allowed Luke to start fresh. He found jedi lore form the times of the Old Republic, before the war on Russan. This allowed him to make changes like allowing marriage, using emotions, bringing in other force using groups, etc that made his jedi much more powerful and his order more intuned with the force. 

It also did some good for the Galaxy. Yes most of the corruption in the senate was because of the Senate himself and the thousand year plot of the Sith but the damage was done. They were already fractured. IT was only by undergoing the horrors of Imperial rule that they could reform into something stronger. And even then they barely held out against the Vong. 

It also allowed ships and technology to advance as well as a entire generation of Jedi and soliders who grew up fighting and who were ready to face the threat of the Vong. 

But on the other hand letting time roll forward like in the movies would mean the end of 99% of all Jedi and the loss of untold centuries of history and knowledge. Not to mention the loss of life that would come from the Empires Rule. 

By informing the Jedi of what's to come they may be able to stop it. By taking Anakin and Obi-wan to the side and talking to them and explaining what is happening you could maybe keep Anakin from falling. Even if it meant he (and Obi-wan because Obi-wan wouldn't abandon him) had to leave the order at least he would be alive and not leading the purge. And who knows. Maybe if you can get though to Yoda he would start to change some of the rules seeing they had went off track. 

And maybe with enough warning the Galaxy could still prepare for the Vong and either meet them at their entry point or scare them away. 

So, what do you choose? Do you warn the Jedi or do you just keep walking untill you find a place with some gizka steak and corellian brandy?",StarWars,True,1518385779,2018-02-11

People such as the Director of COMPNOR, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda (who held one of the highest positions next to the Emperor, yet has never been mentioned/shown aside from the prequels as far as I know), as well as the Imperial Headquarters on Coruscant, which I’m very surprised we’ve never seen play a large role in a film, along with people like Rae Sloane and Gallius Rax not being widely recognized characters.

The Clone Wars are better than the Sequels,"The Clone Wars was great for so many reasons. They created story arcs that focused on side characters, like the domino squad arc. The show also flushed out the Star Wars universe in a positive way, unlike some elements of legends that were just so stupid (I’m looking at you moon that crushed Chewbacca). Finally, they gave the clones personalities, they are not just soldiers made to die, the each have their own personalities and that is something that is brought up over and over again. I almost cried when Fives died and felt sad at Captain Keeli and Ima-Gun Di’s sacrifice. This show was great and did not deserve to have it’s lifespan cut short for Disney’s crappy ideas (Star Wars Rebels).

The year (ABY) Luke exiled himself and the events of Legends,"Reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/7wvhkp/why_do_people_keep_acting_like_kylo_was_a_kid/) post, and finding that there's no official source yet stating it, it made me began to wonder about the possibilites for storytelling between ROTJ and TFA.

It seems there is no confirmed date for when Luke disappeared and not even a precise one for when TFA starts (most put it at 34 ABY), but the general consensus seems to be that the massacre from Ben and Luke's disappearance happened at the very most 6 years before TFA, which would be around 28 ABY.

In the old continuity known as Legends, we know that 29-35 ABY is a period in which nothing major happens as the Yuuzhan Vong war has just ended. The Dark Nest crisis is then the next major thing to occur before Legacy of the Force and Fate of the Jedi which leave us at around 45 ABY.

Now, bear with me, I am not asking for them to bring back the entire old continuity just as it was (it's almost impossible anyway with Chewie around, bless his heart), but it did made me think that perhaps we can have a new version of the same stories told, or at least of the most well-received things by fans? At least I think there's the potential to still ""save"" that material, especially after I thought for a while that the whole massacre at the temple and Luke's disappearance had happened at least a dozen years before TFA.

Perhaps there is no room for a Yuuzhan Vong war or Sheev in a clone body, but I think they can definitely pull a new Thrawn trilogy and the establishment of the New Jedi Order with old familiar faces (such as Katarn, Horn &amp; Durron), also showcasing the Order succesfully lasting for at least a decade before the tragedy with Ben &amp; Luke occurs. 

I think another animated series with all of this, if not most of it, happening would be fantastic. Perhaps some films in the era too. (It's pretty much guaranteed we'll get a film set between VI and VII someday, anyway). There's great room for storytelling that thrillingly connects the old Legends continuity with the rebooted Canon one and moves it all forward towards the Sequel Trilogy.

[General Discussion] Understanding and Interpreting Star Wars through only Star Wars Lenses,"
For me, what makes Star War so enduring is that at its core, it is meant to be a myth that can resonate with each one of us personally on different levels.
It is at its most beautiful when one can draw from one's own experience to relate to certain aspects of Star Wars. That's one sign of good storytelling, is that there can be multiple personal interpretations based on 
your own Point of View or your own cultural influences and life experiences that is common to all Hero's Journey tales. This is what was intended by George and still practiced by directors like JJ and to a greater extent, Rian Johnson. The problem that bugs is me is that people insist on honing down certain aspects as a strict canonical interpretation.

On the Force:
For something that was created to be an ambiguous spiritual analog to many real world religion/spiritual beliefs and quite frankly, a storytelling motif tool, there are a lot of people who miss the point of this and make very LITERAL interpretations. For example: ""how come Leia in TLJ can magically conjure up a Force pull when it was never shown that she could perform any Force powers?...""
I can completely understand not liking how it looked, but this should not prevent from the notion that Leia-in a life or death- can perform this feat. You can look at real world analogies of parents who perform great feats to save/protect their children. This was paraphrased by Rian as part of his reasoning on this moment , plus the fact that she (Leia) is just a motherfucking badass! (verbatim). 
This was also repeated by Dave Filoni many times too.
To paraphrase Dave: ""Be careful on how you interpret the Forces so literally (what it can do or cannot do)....""

On Characters:
People forget that certain characters are there to reflect on other characters, or that they can change, are allowed to make mistakes while still believing that their point of view is correct without explicit stating for us, the audience.
For example Ben Kenobi telling Luke that he is supposed to kill his dad without hesitation and that Luke is the ""Chosen One."" His advice, while justified from Ben's point of view, is not the right one in line with Luke at this stage. Also, his in character explanation of Luke as the ""chosen one"" has been used by some as justification as a definitive answer on who the ""chosen one"" is. But again, the ""chosen one"" can be argued base on how you view the trilogy, whether as Luke's hero journey coming to fruition, or the redemptive story arc of Anakin. Again, the point is that there is no right answer.

On Luke (in the TLJ):
This one is where, like the Force, you either like it because you either love it or hate it. But to say that the Luke you saw in fresh off killing his dad would stay the same and live in your headcannon as a forever untouchable, unimpeachable mythical figure is just what Rian is aware of when he stripped down the myth of Luke and made him into beyond just a simple ""laser sword"" wielding Jedi.
Again, if you go based on your Star Wars lenses, you probably would be offended by how Luke was portrayed. But look at other classic hero figures in other similar mythical stories like Lord of the Rings, Christopher Nolan's Batman, hell- even Avatar the Last Airbender and Legend of Korra. The one thing all of these have in common is that the hero always has a moment of self doubt, seemingly fighting stubbornly against all reason of their own self worth and losing purpose and meaning, before finding some sense gets knocked into them to back into the fight. Also one thing people forget that the hero often ends up with the burden of the new peaceful world on his/her shoulder. Go back and look at Luke against at the end of Jedi- he begins to detach from his friend and you can see the foreboding burden he was carrying even as was watching his dad's boy burn and everyone celebrate. And Plus time (30 plus years) and the eventual reckoning of starting a new Jedi Order had to have some consequence. 
He essentially goes on another hero's journey to find a new purpose at THIS stage in his life. 
Coming in, I expected this would be something that would have to be addressed as one of the main dramatic themes of the movie. And this resonated with me because I was keenly aware of similar hero's journey structures shown from other mythical stories. 
(FYI I highly recommend listening to Rebel Force Radio's episode about the mythological journey of Luke in the TLJ explained (episode on Jan 19 2018)

There are some many other points of debates that are typically argued in this frame of reference, which is Star Wars.
Not everything has to black or white in terms of Star Wars storytelling. Sometimes you can only ""understand"" something if you step outside it.

TO quote Dave Filoni: ""Star War has so much more meaning when you can relate it to your life and real world""

And Pablo: ""To understand Star Wars, you have to watch the movies and stories that influence Star Wars""

How to end the Sequel Trilogy,"Here’s my wrap up for the sequel trilogy:

I want JJ to end it in the same fashion that he rebooted another beloved franchise. With time travel.

In the last act of Episode IX I want the First Order to have basically blown up the galaxy, killing countless trillions and the only recourse is for Rey to reach back in time through the Force and warn Luke Skywalker of the impending doom so he fix what went wrong.

After Rey reaches back through the Force, cut to Sebastian Stan waking up. Threepio comes in, calls him Master Luke, and tells him Princess Leia sensed he was having a trouble sleeping and to inquire if he needed any assistance. He tells him he is fine, just a sense of foreboding and that Leia shouldn’t worry about him while she’s pregnant with twins. Maybe Ewan Macgregor as ghost Obi-wan shows up to say goodbye to Luke.

Now you have a second bite at the sequel apple. You can recast the original characters (maybe Jena Malone as Leia, or I don’t know, not essential to the idea), you can have a more well thought out idea for the sequels, even years of movies with the original 3 characters if you recast them right. You could even do an end of Jumanji type story with Rey, Finn, and Poe further along in a less shitty timeline.

Do it JJ. You’re king of the reboots. Now reboot your own trilogy.

Do trilogies need to end?,"I know the word trilogy is inherently referring to three in a series, but ignoring that, let me frame my question. 

So historically, we've received ""trilogies"" in separate eras, each sort of having their group of characters that develop through each of their three films.
Now with the new ""trilogy"" starting from Ep. VII, theres a general sentiment among us (or so I'm feeling) that we are kind of expecting this new set of stories must end with Ep. IX, almost as if we have one last chance with this new storyline to wrap it all up and conclude before moving on to a new trilogy. 

Now my question is, does it need to end? I mean, I think we're used to the movies being bunched in 3's that we're just expecting that, but what if it just naturally keeps progressing through every following episode?

It's possible that I could be getting it wrong since the prequels sort of disrupted this sequential flow, and that it really is naturally moving episodically, but I get the feeling that theres an expectation for every three films to be their own storyline and its a wrap.",StarWars,True,1518416510,2018-02-12

In my humble opinion TLJ was a good movie, but ruined the Skywalker Saga. So, what if instead of switching so many scenes and changing other parts of TLJ.

"[SPOILERS] The ending to TLJ was excellent, but I feel like it could benefit from a couple of additions. What do you think?","* Finn should never have even attempted the suicide run. It can only end one of 2 ways, either he's unsatisfyingly saved at the last minute, or the best character of the new trio dies. If anything, Poe should've made that run.

* Old style X-Wings. Instead of just finding some useless speeders at the abandoned Rebel base, they could've found some battered OT ships with limited firepower. This would still have them as the underdogs while allowing there to be an enjoyable final battle.

* Luke should've fought the Knights of Ren. Picture this, whilst projecting himself, he expends enough energy to physically hold his ROTJ saber for a few moments, enough time to kill the Knights (I can't imagine them having a more satisfying role in the trilogy at this point), but leaving him exhausted when he has to duel Kylo. For the 3rd time, Luke tosses aside his lightsaber, this time because he simply hasn't the strength to carry on holding it. Then, the rest of the scene could play out as it did on film, wkth Luke baiting Kylo with a projection of the ESB saber.

* Kylo Ren should kill Leia. Heavily wounded after the attack on the Raddus, she decides to stay behind and die with her family, leaving her crew with the memory of the strong general she was. She approaches Kylo and Luke on the battlefield, leaving them both distraught. Lukes gambit has failed to save his sister, and now Kylo must kill his mother or be undermined in front of his whole fleet. Leia pulls Luke's lightsaber to her grip, and the crimson blades of the fallen Knights orbit around her as she tells Kylo that she has no intention of fighting him, but that he isn't getting past her. As the Falcon takes off in the background, the sabers deactivate and fall to the ground, and a weeping Kylo cuts her down. He turns his rage to Luke, screaming 'LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO' and 'WHY DIDN'T YOU SAVE HER'! Frantic slashes have no effect on Luke who composes himself enough to tell Kylo he'll see him around, before vanishing. A devestated Kylo collapses to his knees, and crushes the green saber without lifting a finger. Cut to Luke meditating on Ach To, tears streaming down his face. As the binary suns peek from behind the clouds, Luke is joined by a glowing blue man, and another, then a small alien, and finally, someone distinctly feminine looking.

So if a Force user going all angry and passionate causes those yellow evil eyes, as seen with Maul, Sidious and Vader, why doesn't Kylo get them? Is iit something only real Sith get? If so, how does that work? Is it an ancient spell that only knighted Sith lords of the lineage of Darth Bane are branded with? 


ps. I'm aware Dooku didn't have Sith eyes either in the movies, but his character is mostly calm and reserved.

Something weird I just thought about; I honestly felt more sad during a certain character's death in GOTG2 than I did during Luke's,"\***DISCLAIMER**\*


This is not any sort of hate thread or TLJ dislike thread, I am just trying to discuss how I honestly felt and I find it very interesting. 
I hope that this is considered when you view this thread, and look forward to the discussion. 


**Guardians of the Galaxy Spoilers to follow!!!!**
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

So, I was just recently rewatching GOTG 2, and got to the part where where Yondu saves Peter and dies. I actually started to tear up a little, because the movie did such a good job of making you feel for each character and he went out in a meaningful way. 

This is Yondu, a side character I really didn't give a shit about from the first film, and I actually felt more sad watching him die than I did watching Luke Skywalker. 


Sure, I was sad *that* he died, but the context surrounding his death didn't really make me feel sad. Let me walk through my head while watching TLJ for the first time:
_____________________________________________________
\*Luke pauses, raising his lightsaber just as Obi Wan did to be struck down by Kylo.\* *Oh, shit well I guess this is how it ends. They're doing the Ben Kenobi death. I guess that's cool, I'm really gonna hate Kylo now*

\*Kylo sprints and strikes, music intensity is high. My heart is starting to pump higher because Luke is probably dead. Kylo turns 
around and, Luke is still there\* *Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?*


\*Kylo, just as confused as me, moves towards him and his saber passes straight through Luke. We then switch to Luke, back on Ach-To, floating above the ""force rock"" and meditating. He was projecting himself across the galaxy.\* *HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK LUKE IS A GOD DAMN BADASS HE'S STILL ALIVE AND HE WAS JUST FUCKING WITH KYLO*


\*""See ya around, kid"".\* *Brooooooooooooooooooooooooooo*


\*Switch to Luke again, who falls fown clearly exhausted. As he sits back up, he looks forward toward the horizon. Then he just... dies.\* *Wait, he's dead? W-What? I'm so confused.*

_____________________________________________________
This very abrupt change of emotions is what I belive truly took me out of the scene. The film first prepared me for his death, then siked me out, shotting my hype thursters into overdrive, but then saying ""nah"" and killing him anyway.

This also speaks to why I probably felt more emotion from Yonu's death. They spent the movie highlighting how important the idea of a father was to Peter, and how in the end he had had one all along. They do this in such a gradual way that makes it really powerful when Yondu comes in to save the Guardians, and all the more tragic when he dies saving him saying, ""he may be your father, but he wasn't your daddy"". 

It just kept building and building and then it hit you. Whereas with TLJ it build and builds then you think it finally hits, and it kind of does, but then it pulls a 180 and all the hype is gone.

I just personally feel this could have been dealt with much better. I have no problem with Luke dying, just wish they didn't play so many games with my emotions. ",StarWars,True,1518463767,2018-02-12

As soon as Obi-Wan interrupted Yoda’s youngling class asking about Kamino’s location, she immediately fell in love with the young Jedi and their lightsabers, obsessing over how adorable they were and letting out heartfelt “awww’s”.

(theory) Rey will have a moment where she has Sith eyes,"i think a major theme of the new trilogy is that the force spectrum is less black and white than in the OT/PT. I almost thought she would have a darkside moment with Luke as she fought him on Ach-To, but alas she didnt. She did however display curiosity in the darkside much like Luke did with the Dagobah Darkside cave. My theory is that Kylo is being set up as the one we are supposed to believe will be the new Sith major enemy, but Rey will be the one to really display the darkside (if only briefly). I think the reason they want to achieve that effect is to move forward with the force spectrum idea.

I hope that sharing my story provides me closure: the new trilogy affects me like no one else,"In April 2015, I came home early from work to find that my wife was pregnant. Over the next two months, we talked about names and decided on Alphonse Finn for a boy and some other name for a girl. In June, our baby came too early and died in our hands; we could tell that he was a boy, so we gave him his name.

The rest of 2015 was really painful for us both. The new Star Wars movie was one of the few things I was looking forward too. As my wife and I were watching The Force Awakens on opening weekend, we got to the part where Poe gives John Boyega his new name: Finn. Of course, I burst into tears and didn't stop crying for most of the movie. Loved it.

In June of 2017, my wife revealed to me again that she was pregnant and we'd be having a baby for real maybe this time. This little one lasted longer than Al did, and we found out that this was a girl. Her name is going to be Amelie Rose. In fact, at the time of this post, she'll be here within the next week and a half.

Some of you might already see where I'm going with this.

Fast forward to opening weekend of The Last Jedi. Finn is caught sneaking around and gets accosted by a crew member. They interact. They exchange looks. They exchange names.

""Rose.""

So Poe goes against Leia’s orders and leads an attack against the Dreadnaught and destroys it. Then they are tracked through light speed and have little fuel left, so they hold themselves just out of range of the destroyers while they evacuate. 

But the dreadnaught accurately hit their base from the atmosphere with them gigantic canons - clearly it was not subject to the same range constraints as the destroyers. So if Poe didn’t take out the dreadnought everything would have been caput anyways. 

How did he not point this out to anyone? His insistence on destroying the dreadnaught literally saved the entire resistance. ",StarWars,True,1518476321,2018-02-12

Does that mean we won't get any standalones in between? Which means no Kenobi movie for example, or will lucasfilm release two movies per year in the future?",StarWars,True,1518481495,2018-02-12
[Discussion] Sequel Trilogy and the Galaxy at large,"Since watching the Last Jedi I have had this urge to discuss my personal problems with the sequel trilogy. So I felt that this was a good time as any to post my thoughts on it.

I want to start off by saying that I have liked the movies so far despite everything, I had some issues with how The Last Jedi did a lot of redundant plots that lead nowhere in the end but I still like them. Both my parents loved Star Wars and when I got old enough to see it they showed me them in the order of 1,2,4,5,6 as this was pre 05. I have rewatched these movies countless times and I love them all, both Prequels and the Original Trilogy. Although I do agree that the Prequels have their flaws but no scene would fill me with such joy and excitement as the beginning of Episode III with the battle over Coruscant. Seeing Venators who obviously was the precursor to the Star Destroyers, knowing what's coming in a huge space battle together with the Arc fighters and their S-foils which became the X-Wings and even V wings and the new clone armours just.. its hard to describe but it brought the serious together for me. It was the bridge that made the Prequels and OT into one Hexology. 

When I watched The Force Awakens for the first time I felt a disconnect. Previous movies have done timeskips but the setting have still been familiar. In essence TFA borrowed a lot from Episode 4 which to begin with made it feel like it lacked the originality to stand on its own but it also created an entirely new setting that was never fully explained. 

With the Old Republic you knew of its existance during the OT and the Rebel Alliance itself had as intention of restoring the Democracy that came before. In TFA you have a New Republic that is never discussed at all and only there in essence to be eradicated as a way of establishing The First Order. But the main problem here is that with both TFA and TLJ you are undoing everything the OT accomplished. Instead of expanding the universe forward, the JJ trilogy feels like its only regressing the plot to another rebellion/empire story. What divided the Prequels and OT on a ""Grand scale"" was that the Prequels had a civil war like the American Civil War with ""Two"" major factions fighting on more equal terms whilst the Original Trilogy had the Rebellion as a guerilla force striking out against an oppressive, totalitarian government. But with the Sequel you start out with a weird situation that makes little sense to begin with and a ""Resistance"" that is stupid as a faction in every conceivable way. None of it makes any real sense but that matters little right now.

Lets begin with the battle of Endor. The battle at large marked the death of the Emperor and the ""Victory"" of the Rebellion and creation of the New Republic shortly afterwards. In the old EU that is now non canon and I have not read it this was dealt with extensively. What is clear regardless is that the death of the Emperor doesn't mean the end of the Empire in large. Most of the Imperial fleets weren't involved at Endor to begin with and considering it spanned the entire galaxy whilst also being severly more militarized than the Republic, one victory, even removing the supreme leader wouldn't mean that everything was good. The old EU dealt with this through ""Warlords"", were governors would declare their own factions as the death of the emperor and Darth Vader destabilized the Empire at large and most leaders could most likely not agree on what course to take. The New Republic also used the chaos to assert itself in a defensive and stronger position but if anything is true, it had no capacity of uniting the galaxy in its entirety.

With the Sequel trilogy instead you had the creation of the First Order which is sort of a revanchist and extreme form of imperial rebirth, if any of the factions made sense in the sequels so far I would say it is the First Order. Its not inconceivable for a regime like that to eventually come forth from the chaos but so far nothing has been explained of how this happened and everything at the start suggested that the First Order was located only in the Outer Rim and fairly small in size. But with TLJ suddenly they rule the Galaxy and the Republic was wiped out in one single attack. What I am trying to say is that the geopolitical situation of the Sequels make no sense and instead the story is isolated to ""few characters"" and the universe is treated like it doesn't exist outside the main story. The Prequels and OT atleast had several things that connected them with each other. For example the Twi'leks, Jawas, Tatooine and a lot of other stuff whilst also having some variation. But these movies took place in a ""living galaxy"" whilst the Sequels lack this connection.

This is turning into an unorganized mess sort of but lets go onto the role of the New Republic. 
As the politics between the New Republic and First Order are unclear in the movies, the feeling I first got was that they had sort of a Cold War. Then I learnt of the stupid peace treaty that barely makes sense at all where the New Republic wouldn't be allowed to expand its military. This makes no sense to begin with as the New Republic at large is built on an armed rebellion, having had to deal with Imperial remnants and just exactly the First Order they should have no desire to cut down its military because it would be there to prevent what happened in TFA to begin with. The second is the Republic Fleet. According to TFA it was wiped out in its entirety but why would any sensible government put ITS ENTIRE FLEET in orbit of one planet?! and why would you only have one fleet to begin with?!

The Resistance is meant to be the ""armed part"" of the Republic whilst in actuality its just a shitty way to bring back a rebellion look alike. The name makes no sense, They aren't resisting anyone to begin with as they are sort of part of the Republic, a sovereign government and aren't against them. The First Order is also in itself an individual sovereign nation making it kinda impossible for them to ""rebell"" against them because in essence they aren't a part of The First Order.

Rouge One made a much better movie than both of these because it atleast fit in within 3 and 4 as a 3,5 and back then the Rebellion was a thing but ugh. For me the creators didn't want to do anything original because its risky and fanservice sells.....

But let me try and explain what I would have rather seen.
1st. The First Order in itself I like as an idea, but instead of being so horrendously vague about how it exists, try and flesh it out more. It would have been an intriguing way of bringing Thrawn from the EU into canon. Instead of Snoke, have maybe Thrawn being the one to unite the First Order and desire to recreate The Empire. Snoke is unexplained and just a big mystery at large and TLJ made that even worse. Kylo Ren is also a character that should be kept as he is well made but rewrite it to some way either him falling to the dark side by himself or something and being subservient to Thrawn, The Knights of Ren is also something that should be kept in The First Order to flesh that part out. 
2nd scrap the Resistance entirely, instead have the Republic as the second major faction, to me it would make a lot more sense to have ""2 equals"" instead of a rebellion or Civil War as this would change it up more and bring a bit of originality to it. Then also change the lore with the Jedi Order, Luke can gladly be sent to exile but allow some of his apprentices to survive and maintain a New Jedi Order as a counterbalance to the Knights of Ren. 
3rd scrap Starkiller base. Oversized Death Star with a faction a lot weaker than the Empire makes zero sense. A more sensible plot would be to have TFA be set during a ""Cold War"" setting where the main plot leads to the discovery of some form of plot by The First Order to take the Republic by surprise, have them launch an invasion of the Republic core world, might even use a ""mini deathstar"" to wipe out its government and then launch an invasion. You could then have the TLA as the Republic fighting a losing war and on the defensive, having it turn around and the 9th movie winning the war... Idk this became ranty but I am just so tired of how braindead the galaxy at large the Sequels seem to be....

The problem with repeat viewings and TLJ,"I've seen TLJ twice, and while I enjoyed it enough the first time, the second time had one glaring moment that just kind of broke the movie for me.

On first viewing, the audience doesn't know whether Holdo has a plan or what it is.  Thus we naturally side with Poe.  

It fits the usual movie trope: a new character is put in command of a ship or military unit, but that new commander is unfit for duty or otherwise unprepared for the responsibility. They get overwhelmed or choose some cowardly path. Then it falls to our hero protagonist to commit some ""noble mutiny"" to save the day.  It's in all sorts of films, TV, and books.

It's obvious that Rian Johnson wanted to set up the audience to think this trope was coming, then subvert it.  In the first viewing, it seems like Holdo either doesn't have a plan or is unreasonable in not sharing it with Poe. Thus we side with Poe ... and then we later find out that he (and we) were in the wrong. Our heroes make mistakes.

That intention of subverting tropes is noble, and I commend Johnson for it.

The problem comes in the subsequent viewings.

In subsequent viewings, the audience *knows* that Holdo has a plan, and we know what it is.  Thus, every time Poe tries to extract the plan from Holdo, we view the scene very closely to try and figure out why Holdo doesn't tell Poe the plan.

There are three opportunities:

* 1) When Holdo first takes command, Poe asks her what the plan is.  She reminds him he is demoted and tells him to follow orders.  Though you'd think she might be a *little* bit more obliging to the person who destroyed Starkiller Base just a few days prior, it's still fair that she needs Poe to settle down and know his place, especially given the disaster with the bombers.
* 2) Later on, Poe again comes to the bridge and sees that the shuttles are being fueled.  He accuses Holdo of having no real plan, of being a coward. In frustration, he acts out physically, kicking over stuff. Holdo orders him off her bridge. At this point, you'd think *someone* on that bridge (assuming they know Holdo's plan) would speak up in defense of Holdo not being a coward. But still, it's reasonable to expect that Holdo would not tell him anything--Poe's clearly buckling under stress and is an emotional loose cannon.
* 3) Here's the problem. Poe and his fellow mutineers ambush Holdo and her officers in the hangar, where the shuttles are being fueled. Poe relieves Holdo of command and announces his intention to go to the bridge and stop the shuttles from being fueled. **At this point, there is no sensible reason for Holdo and her officers to not tell Poe the plan.  If his mutiny is allowed to continue, the entire Crait plan -- and the Resistance itself -- are in jeopardy.**

It's a moment of crisis. While Holdo later kicks a steam vent and overpowers Poe's associates, she can't have been certain that that would be successful -- and regardless, it would take time to retake the bridge and get the shuttles fueling again. 

The clearest, simplest, fastest way to stop Poe's mutiny would be to tell him at least some of the truth of the plan, right there in the hangar.

Surely she can't consider him a possible First Order collaborator--again, he blew up Starkiller Base. He's the one person in the entire Resistance who is absolutely not a First Order agent.

On my second viewing of TLJ, I tried and tried to manufacture some reason that Holdo and her officers didn't tell the mutineers the plan at that moment.  I could not find one that holds up.

The only explanation is that it would've foiled Rian Johnson's ""gotcha"" moment. But while that works in the first viewing, it's going to be a difficult pill to swallow every time I rewatch this movie going forward. :(

I really wish Rian Johnson had taken few more passes at the script to make the whole fleet chase/Holdo/Poe/FinnRose plot more elegant and less contrived :( Or maybe he simply wasn't thinking about repeat viewings in mind.

But I was thinking of a way for Vader to still be in the movie without them meeting face to face. 

I think it would be cool if throughout the movie, sometimes Kenobi would be meditating and reaching out with the Force trying to search for other living Jedi. And he finds one, or possibly more, but every time he does Vader shows up and slaughters them.

Gun violence in The Last Jedi,"I was struck by the lack of blaster fire in The Last Jedi. I'm not certain anyone ever gets shot in the movie. About the only scene I can think of is Rose shooting Phasma to no effect, and then the Resistance shooting at Finn and Rose's ship, also to no effect. Most all of the action seems to be non-gun related (Fathiers running through walls, Finn with energy baton, vehicle on vehicle, melee weapons).

Given the current attitude in Hollywood toward gun violence do you think they may have purposefully deemphasized the use of blasters by characters? It seems to be an element that is strangely absent. Admittedly few of the scenes as written seem to call for shooting blasters, but the scenes are a choice by the writer.

Can I ask a favor of you guys?,"Now, I know this post will probably get thumbed down into oblivion but here goes nothing.

I'll come right out and say it. I absolutely love Star Wars. I'm a life-long fan. I love all the films, all the games (at least the ones I've played anyway), I love it all. I can't get enough of it. I'm always excited and enthusiastic for the release of new Star Wars content and I'm just always happy and at peace when I'm watching one of the films or playing one of the games. I'm proud to be a Star Wars fan and I've always felt that if someone else is also a fan, we'll get along just fine.

But then whenever I log onto a Star Wars related site, I just find myself disappointed at the way a lot of fans treat eachother. I understand that not all fans are going to go about being a fan the way I do and that's fine. But It's almost heartbreaking to see fans acting so condescending, snarky, salty, bitter, cynical, vicious, and sometimes just downright mean-spirited towards eachother. There's always so much spite and argument just because we all have conflicting opinions about the Saga.

I know, I know, ""Welcome to the internet. Welcome to Reddit."" But it doesn't have to be this way. We're all here for one reason: We all love Star Wars. Isn't that enough? Most of us saw these films as children and we fell in love with that Galaxy Far Far Away. Now here we all are, brought together because of it. There's no reason for us to belittle and drag eachother down.

I guess all I'm asking is for my fellow fans to be a little more decent, rational, and civilized towards eachother because we all share the same love for this universe that's so near and dear to us. I know it sounds cringey but can't we all just get along?

I said it before. I love Star Wars. So, I guess by extension, I love you all too.

Is it possible to see people who are not force-sensitive like ghosts? ',"I was recently watching episode V on TV and I noticed something Yoda says, that I had forgotten:

- ''*Through the Force, Things you wil see, other places, the future, the past,* **old friends long gone**''

Beyond Yoda, Obi-wan and Leia, Luke does not know anyone who is sensitive to force and in no way does Yoda specify anything beyond '' old friends long gone '', so it can only be interpreted as people not sensitive to force. . This led me to think about all those theories that Han Solo could come back as a ghost, which at first seemed silly to me, but if this is so, it would make sense.

However, in the movies, there is no more information about that, so far we have only seen ghosts of people sensitive to force. And after Empire, we have not heard more references to non-sensitive ghosts.So there's not much in the movies that confirms this


So....Is there any canonical or Legends source that confirms or explains this line?

List of reasons why I love Rogue One (and why I'm a huge Star Wars nerd).,"•The very beginning, we see something come into frame. At first you think its a starship but its actually the rings of a planet!

•The design of Krennic's shuttle is waaaaaay cooler than Kylo Ren's shuttle. I love the impractically long tri-fins over the two vertical ones on Ren's ship. 

•Lah'mu is a beautifully perfect planet for Star Wars. It conforms to the single-biome rule for most planets, but its an environment we've never really seen before.

•We hear a hint of the new Imperial theme, which sounds just as fitting as the original did.

•Even the random droid that alerts Erso's family of Krennic's shuttle shows that the designs of the technology are going to have that classic Star Wars feel to it.

•Blue milk.

•A direct call back to the prequel era (something thats insultingly lacking in the sequels) with Saw Gerrera.

•THE DEATH TROOPERS LOOK SOOOO BADASS!!! And I love the sound of their distorted voices. They are pretty much the exact people I think of when I think of Imperial Special Forces/ Elite commandos.

•Although I wish the movie had the traditional title crawl, I do like the Rogue Ons title card.

•The return of Stormtroopers!

•Its cool how they immediately show the darker side of the rebellion. It gives the whole Rebels vs. Empire fight a more realistic feel.

• I love the look of the random guy in Saw Gerrera's group who wears a black scout trooper helmet. 

•HOLY FUCK IS THAT A JUGGERNAUT/TURBO TANK?!?!! FUCK YES I AM ERECT

•K2SO is a perfect addition to the droid characters in Star Wars. He's got the sassiness that fans of HK-47 *and* casual fans will love.

•Yavin 4. I love the music. I love how everything looks. I love how I feel like I'm suddenly home after being away after a long time.

•""I find that answer vague and unconvincing.""

•The U-Wing is honestly one of my favorite star wars ship designs. It fits perfectly into the ""wing"" series of star fighters.

•Holy shit Tarkin is here?!? I know the second I saw him that it was a cgi face, but it still looks amazing. 

•The reveal of the Star Destroyer over Jedha city is my favorite shot in Star Wars. Period.

•The Tank Trooper armor looks really cool. 

•I love how there's a distinction between the actual rebels and Saw Gerrera's extremists who are basically terrorists. Also you got to hand it to the three guys who stand right in front of the convoy and just whip out their blasters from under their robes.

•The way they just nonchalantly vaporize Jedha city is bone chilling. The Death Star gives an apocalyptic atmosphere when ever it shows up.

And this list just keeps on going throughout the entire movie. Its a Star Wars fan's wet dream when it comes to the design of the tech and the perfect blend of a little bit of the prequel era with the majority of it being original trilogy era. 

Rogue One is admittedly one of my favorite movies in general because its just pure Star Wars magic. ",StarWars,True,1518507080,2018-02-13
The struggles and flaws of Sabine Wren's character...,"A small analysis from someone who considers themself an expert on her character: 

Definition of a Mary Sue- A perfect, idealised fictional character that has no significant flaws or struggles.

And now onto Sabine: 

-*Arrogance*. Sabine is quite good at a lot of stuff, from weapons to athletics. And she knows this. It's given her a bit of an ego. We saw in her training with Kanan and Ezra how she was unwilling to learn due to how confident she was in herself, and it took a bit of a butt-kicking in order to get her to open up and be humble. As a cadet, The Empire manipulated this trait in order to have her create deadly weapons by presenting the tasks as challenges for her to overcome. Due to her competitive nature, she clearly put her all into it which would come to bite her behind when her people suffered from her work. Sabine herself describes this when Bo-Katan demanded to know why she developed said weapons: 
""I was young. It was a challenge, and I was arrogant."" 

-*Naivety*. Sabine was once a loyal servant to The Empire. She clearly had a strong opinion of them and believed they'd benefit Mandalore in some form. The weapons Sabine developed, she didn't believe that The Empire would actually use them. This mistake costed the lives of those she considered friends and family, and would destroy her reputation with her people, as well as her clan's. 
""I didn't know The Empire would use the weapon I designed against our people!"" 

-*Facing The Past*. It took a lot for Sabine to go back to Mandalore and face the consequences of what she did, as well as take on the burden of The Darksaber. She feared all this specifically because the past would definitely come back to haunt her and she knew what she'd be met with. Sabine had been filled with doubt when she had to train with The Darksaber and needed the support of others in order to see it through to the end. Her return home was dangerous for both herself and her family. But still, Sabine was willing to own up for what she did, and worked towards putting things right for her people, and repairing her reputation as a Mandalorian. This was the greatest struggle of her character. 
""How can I lead my people? How can I go back and face them!?"" 

-*Morals*. We've seen in the past that, unlike the rest of the crew, Sabine didn't have much issue with the concept of killing or revenge. In Season 2 it was stressed by Kanan that ""how they chose to fight"" was of great importance. Ezra tackled with Kanan's morals here, but Sabine took them further. After Hera was nearly killed by Fenn Rau and The Protectors, Sabine (understandably) wanted to kill all of them in return. She was, for a period, willing to jeopardise the Rebel fleet for her own agenda to kill Rau. In Season 1 she casually fired point blank into a stormtrooper's face and executed them, the clear intention of killing, despite it being said in that season that The Spectres aren't interested in violence. Of course, over time Kanan did manage to turn her around, and growing to reject the Mandalorian way was apart of her character development, which we saw especially when she refused to kill Gar Saxon. She also tackled with it when she was conflicted whether or not to deploy The Duchess against The Empire, to stoop to their level. Accepting the Rebellions's approach to conflict is something she had earned over time. 
""Ugh. You know, this Jedi philosophy stuff doesn't work for everyone."" 
""Fine. But not just the ships. Rau has to pay for what he did to Hera."" 

-*Buckethead syndrome.* Like all those with a helmet, Sabine banged her head on something. Ouch. 

These have given actual consequence and challenge to her character. Her naivety and arrogance led to her whole ordeal with The Duchess, resulting in her becoming alienated from her own people, her own family. Being abandoned by those she had close relationships with had broken her ability to trust people from that point, which we saw explored mostly in Season 1+2. Her fear of facing what happened on Mandalore and taking responsibility for her actions was an obstacle for her to overcome, and she was forced to take on this obstacle when The Darksaber found itself in her hands. Her morals was another obstacle, for it put her at odds with allies and could've potentially been very dangerous if she didn't resist her Mandalorian traditions. She was once so eager to kill Rau for hurting her family, but would eventually go on to spare Saxon despite knowing all that he did and being in such a position to end him. With the help of her friends and family, Sabine was able to own up to the mistakes she made, that which she never would've been able to or wanted to face without them. She grew as a person by accepting a new philosophy and sticking with it no matter how hard she was tempted to break it, as well as taking on great responsibilities that she initially rejected. 

Her story is that of a proud individual who had good intentions, but their mistakes led to them being shunned and alienated from the culture which they admired. It took time, support and commitment for that person to face their mistakes and set things right. From this, they have been taught many lessons, and have thus grown as a person. 

That is the character of Sabine Wren. ",StarWars,True,1518507251,2018-02-13

Some speculation I've been having considering the new Solo movie,"In the new Solo trailer there's a few scenes with Han and Lando sporting some ""fur"". It's quite reminiscent of first The Force Unleashed game where starkiller defeats the commander(Ozzik Sturn) in order to save Leia and some Wookies. The commander is seen wearing fur in the cutscene where he confronts Leia upon arrival. My guess is that in the start of the movie a lot of mostly imperial loyalists are gonna be wearing Wookie fur as a fashionable statement but will, toward the end of the movie, drop it A' la space horse in The Last Jedi.

About an Obiwan movir,"I would absolutely love to see an Obiwan movie with Ewan McGregor.

but

I'm just about done listening to the book ""Kenobi"", which explores part of Obiwan's life after he escapes to Tatooine with baby Luke. 

Its absolutely, incredibly, boring. 

Maybe it's because I've been listening to all the Star Wars audio books at my library, which include the new books created under the Disney Star Wars group. I've also listened to some of the EU that's in an unsure place in terms of canon because they rely on the stories told by The Old Republic games.

But really Obiwan went into hiding after episode 3, he wouldn't be getting into the same kind of adventures like he did with Anakin. Hes depressing as hell throughout the book.

If there was any place to explore Obiwan it'd be a prequel, unless Disney was okay revisiting stories already told in the Clone wars series. With a prequel I doubt they'd bring back Ewan. I mean make up and CGI are great, and Ewan hasn't aged a day, but it'd look weird to see an older person playing young Obiwan when we've already seen a young Ewan playing Obiwan in episode 1.

So where does that leave us?

Personally, I would be okay with a movie that takes place in between episode 1 and 2 where we get to see Obiwan starting to train Anakin. ",StarWars,True,1518538444,2018-02-13

Ben Solo Must Die In The Next Film And Rey Should Kill Him,"Hear me out on this one.

In the last few decades we've had: 

- A republic fall.
- A horrible empire rise.
- A horrible empire fall. 
- A horrible empire rise again.  
- Entire planets getting blowed up.

All of this involving galactic warfare on a massive scale costing millions or billions of lives (it has to be billions right?). 

**In the meantime these force sensitive jerks are at the center of it all, and the Jedi have failed to act at critical times, or even just quit and done nothing.**

The Jedi would seem to claim to try to help keep the peace or fight for justice or something.... but rather they seem to be more worried about saving their dark side friends / family, or just moping about on islands or swamps rather than trying to stop the slaughter.

Now galactic politics is at fault too but there's no getting around that the force sensitive crowd is playing a lead role at both doing these horrible things and ... not doing things about it.

Examples:

- The Jedi missed out that Sidious was right under their nose.

- Obi-wan / Qui-gon found and trained Anakin who would be Darth Vader.  

- Obi-wan failed to stop or kill Anakin ... or even take him into custody or whatever at the critical moment.

- Luke trained Ben Solo and failed to take action before he turned.

At this point is saving Ben's soul worth it?  He already has been party to blowing up another planet.  Let's say Ben is saved in the end... so what?   Millions or billions dead to save Ben's precious soul?

Arguably it's all the Sith's fault but there's no way getting around that the Sith's best tools are coming from the Jedi ranks.  Maybe the Sith could get some other people outside the Jedi, and sometimes they do.... but they seem to pick up a lot of critical Jedi help here and there and the Jedi fail to stop it when they can.

It's time for the Jedi to make the hard decisions.  It's time for Rey to make that call... **Rey must cut down Ben for the good of everyone**.   The books have been burned, it's time for something new, a Jedi who will take action when it is needed and not mope around if things don't work out.

She must do it for the good of the galaxy, but also to kill off the mopey / ineffective / or straight up evil Jedi narrative that keeps on repeating itself. ",StarWars,True,1518540640,2018-02-13

Something I noticed regarding how Rey tends to react to potential confrontations in TFA and TLJ.,"I've watched both sequel movies a number of times and I've noticed that in the majority of all scenarios where Rey ends up having to fight or where one is likely to break out that she's the aggressor and attacks first, attempts to do so or reacts with a serious escalation of violence . As I recall, Yoda in ESB tells Luke that a Jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. Yet Rey, more often than not, does the opposite when she has the ability to influence how the encounter will evolve before violence is necessary.

On Jakku when Unkar Plutt's thugs try to steal BB-8 they didn't outright attack her to get the droid from the get go. Her reaction is to start a fight with them. Yeah it's easy to wave it off by saying that the act of even trying to steal BB-8 was just asking for a confrontation, but the point is that she drew first blood. The next thing Rey does immediately after that is attack Finn after BB-8 tells her that Finn has ""stolen"" Poe's jacket rather than confront him and ask why he has it instead of Poe. She's never seen Finn up until this moment and he hasn't done anything overtly aggressive towards her. Within the span of roughly two minutes Rey starts two fights when she had the agency to begin with a less aggressive approach and then let it evolve from there.

The next encounter we get where Rey has the ability to influence how a confrontation will evolve is in the deleted scene where Unkar Plutt tracked her to Takodana and confronted her. Unkar initiates the confrontation by grabbing her first before she knows he's there. She tells him to let her go, a decidedly more measured way to attempt to deescalate the situation. Unkar tells Rey no he won't go away, to which she responds by trying to shoot him in the face with her blaster. The only reason she doesn't kill him right then and there is because she didn't turn the safety off. Next we have her encounter the Stormtroopers outside of the castle. She knows that they're looking for her and will almost certainly attack her when they find her. The thing is, the troopers hadn't noticed her yet. Rey could have easily just continued to run away to elude capture without the troopers having ever been the wiser. Instead she tries to shoot them before they see her, she acts with the intent to kill right off the bat. 

Next we have Rey and Finn finding Kylo Ren in the forest near the end of the movie. It's obvious Kylo is going to try and kill them that much is clear, but Rey still makes the first offensive move and tries to shoot him. In the second phase when she has Anakin's lightsaber in her hands she again makes the first move and attacks Kylo. When she eventually triumphs she has Kylo Ren completely at her mercy. In the novelization it is heavily implied that she seriously considered, albiet briefly, murdering Kylo right then and there when he was unarmed and completely defenseless as far as Rey was concerned. Yeah Kylo might have had another trick up his sleeve but by all accounts he wouldn't have been able to defend himself if Rey did go for a killing blow.

In TLJ the first confrontation Rey gets in is with Luke, the one person she was relying on to teach her the ways of the force and help her find her place in the world. Hell she attacks him from behind when he wasn't paying attention or even thinking that she might attack him. And when Luke eventually disarms Rey she instantly goes for the lightsaber and raises it menacingly. Now it should be rather obvious that she wasn't going to actually kill Luke, who had no proper way of defending against a lightsaber, but Luke doesn't know that. The last time he was at the mercy of somebody with a lightsaber when he was forcibly disarmed and didn't have the equipment to properly defend himself was against Vader in ESB and he lost his hand in that encounter. For all Luke knows Rey might very well continue the attack. He's seen her willingly, if not actively, seek out the dark side in his very first lesson with her. Enough evidence in my mind (but perhaps not Luke) to suspect that Rey might be a repeat of Kylo Ren.

Finally when Rey goes to Kylo on the supremacy they both enter Snoke's throne room absolutely convinced that the other will join them and turn away from their previous allegiance. When the two eventually do defeat the Praetorian guard it's reasonable to assume that Kylo is still convinced that Rey will join him so it is just as reasonable to assume that Kylo wasn't expecting to fight Rey. But once it becomes clear to Rey that Kylo won't turn the very first thing she does is try and steal away Anakin's lightsaber from Kylo's possession and attack him. Kylo (probably) didn't know or expect that would happen, had he reacted a second slower he would probably have been killed. 

I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that Rey is very quick to choose violence, lethal force even, as her first course of action when an obstacle presents itself. Even when she doesn't initially go for the kill from the start she quickly escalates to attacking with lethal intent (trying to shoot Unkar Plutt in the face when her own thinly veiled threats don't work) or resorting to underhanded tactics (attacking Luke from behind and trying for a sneak attack on Kylo). To me it begs the question if Rey has killed or has tried to before on Jakku. For somebody who is supposed to be the de-facto champion of the light side of the force now, she seems like a pretty proactively violent person. Just a thought I've been mulling over for some time now.

An Empire film?,"I feel Vader is still missing a whole lot of character development between Episode III and IV. I know this has been covered in comics and a book but if everyone else gets a movie why not improve Anakin a little.

The reason I say an Empire film is because of course we don't want to completely ruin the established characters and with 2 - 2.5 hours I'm sure we would get too many 'Don't choke on your ambitions' lines. 

It could feature Tarkin (recast not CGI) maybe a scene with Palpatine at the beginning doing some training/sith meditation with Vader somehow bringing up him not saving Padme and showing a rift between them, possibly ending the scene with Palps giving him a zap showing he won't take any shit.

Now I know Disney wouldn't want to completely focus on the Empire for a whole film so maybe have the Empire attack a Rebel base and take a bunch of prisoners (Organa and his wife as well maybe? No Leia). Show them working on escape throughout the film and sparingly show Vader and Tarkin when they aren't interacting with their captives.

Could be quite dark but I just feel we know too little about Anakins journey to Darth Vader it is warranted. 

Could even be part of the plot in the Kenobi film but I wouldn't want Vader to see him again before A New Hope. Maybe they are in a slave camp when Vader and Tarkin have finished questioning them.

I think I've figured out what bothers me about the Last Jedi debate,"Since The Last Jedi came out in December, it has been divisive and controversial, to say the least. I really enjoyed the movie. Not to say that it's perfect because it's not. But the more I saw that some others did not enjoy it as much as I did, it started to bother me. Like really bothered me. And I could not for the life of me figure out why. I think I have finally figured it out.

Now, there are some points of the Last Jedi that lead many to the conclusion that Star Wars isn't special to them anymore. While I still believe some cases of that are hyperbolic, I can see where some of them are coming from now. 

I initially chalked it up to whiny fanboyism; people were just complaining because the movie didn't play out to exactly to how they wanted. Whether it be a desire to see more from the old expanded universe, or their fan theories not being confirmed for them. Or even a possible desire to see the same Luke Skywalker from the end of Return of the Jedi. I now realize that, for the most part, I was just being dismissive of what some were saying. That the legitimate points being made were inherently wrong by disagreeing with me. 

I had originally planned to go over the major talking points of what I like and dislike about The Last Jedi, but at this point, it's been talked about to death, and wouldn't do much to service what I'm about to say. 

I think what it is is that I love Star Wars. Many of you love Star Wars. It's a cultural milestone that has touched our lives and ignited imaginations of people all over the world. That's not to say that Star Wars is always perfect, or that every movie is going to be the best ever. But Star Wars has a magic to it that we all love. And I think that's what bothers me about this whole thing. I want everyone to love Star Wars like I do. 

I think we all interpret the mythos of Star Wars differently. But I think that's part of its magic. There's the saying that ""No one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans"". I wish this wasn't a thing. I know we criticize because we love. But I would like to hear the saying be ""No one loves Star Wars like Star Wars fans"".

I know what I'm looking for isn't really possible. But this is more for emotional catharsis than anything else for me. I just want to see Star Wars bring people together rather than tear them apart. ",StarWars,True,1518570273,2018-02-13

"Settle and argument between brothers. In Episode 1, would it have been more logical to find Anakin as a child or as a teenager?","Spoilers obviously, though I can’t imagine anybody in here hasn’t seen the movie. Anyway, my brother says it would have made more sense if Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan had found Anakin as a teenager, because it makes no sense that anyone would let a child participate in a death race even on a lawless planet like Tatooine. Additionally, he argues that Anakin is too smart for a kid and shouldn’t be able to operate spacecraft so well and be so proficient in mechanical engineering without any previous training. I say that finding him as a child is the most significant way to incorporate Anakin into the story plot-wise because it makes it seem as if it was fate that they found the chosen one. I say Anakin is able to pod race and engineer so well because the force lends him these talents. Also, of course they would let a kid pod race on a lawless Tatooine, especially a slave child.

What is the nature of theur relationship, have they met, did Luke disfigure him and/or leave him for dead simmilar to how Obi wan did to Vader, which one of them was more powerful. Even if you don't tell us where he came from or who he is, i believe at the very least some of these should have been answered or hinted at because they are relevant to the current story. Some random jackass corrupts his star pupile and Luke doesn't ask questions or care enough to find out more about him, or at leas warn Rey about what she's getting herself into. I get that they want to focus on Kylo and shit but that doesn't excuse their treatment of this guy.

My Snoke theory from a while ago.,"In Visual Dictionary of The Last Jedi we see some info on snoke and, his ring. Its said to have obsidian from beneath th Darth Vaders Castle on Mustafar (in canon comics it was a place strong with the dark side, where he ""bled"" the crystal and turned it red). But, its said to have ""Dwartii"" glyphs on it. Only mention of Dwartii in legends or canon are Four Sages of Dwartii (Sistros, Braata, Yanjon, Faya), whose statues we see throughout the Palpatines office. 

(LEGENDS)In legends one of them, Braata, is said to have studied dark side and other, Sistros is said to be selfish and use his wisdom for wealth.

(CANON) In canon book about Tarkin,Palpatine says he keeps Sistros statue for ""sentimental"" value. This means he might have had some contact with at least one of the four sages. Why would they even mention it, something so meaningless(i think not) in canon

(QUESTIONABLE) I seen a picture in the internet calling them Sistros Nevet, Braata Danlos, Yanjon Zelmar, Faya Rodemos. Havent seen it used anywhere else, so im on fence about this. Going to share the pucture below

(CONCLUSION) I believe that Snoke is Sistros. Greedy, possibly force wielder ( i believe they must have had some force connection as they were embraced by Sidious). Sistros Nevet even gives you SN initials, this could explain his name. It would make sense if Sidous and Plagueis ( i think that plagueis in canon will still be Sidious's master, it was strongly implied in RotS) had fought against him and scarred him, and then he went into hiding, waiting for the Sidious lineage to end.

I was a fan of Plagueis theory, but i think its even better. Maybe he teached Plagueis how to crate life with the force? Idk there are so many loose ends.

By doing so that would leave regular humans to take up the ranks of the regular storm trooper corps.

Never quite understood that. The empire relied on a huge military so wouldn’t it be smart to have as many guys as possible? Normal human recruits under the command of normal human admirals meanwhile the imperial shock troopers are commanded by clones themselves. 

This is just a pure hypothetical question, just curious as to what you guys think. And no I don’t buy the whole “it was too expensive to keep cloning” copout.

[SPOILERS ALL] (My Perception Of) The Point of the Skywalker Legend.,"I feel like a lot of people are going to miss the point that The Last Jedi was trying to make, whether they enjoyed it or not. I'm bad with words, but this is my attempt at explaining what this movie- and to a lesser extent, Star Wars- means to me. My point of view, for better or for worse.

Remember the kids at the end (Broom Kid. what are we calling him?), and remember how they were telling this awesome epic tale of Luke Skywalker. Now, Remember Rey in VII saying ""I thought he was a myth""? Realize how every major event concerning the Skywalker family has little to no real evidence to back it up (in my opinion underscored by Luke's final Grand Action that he wasn'tevenfuckingtherefor!). I won't delve into the question of how much of the general public knew that Vader was the Jedi's golden boy, but here's some more examples of times where a Skywalker managed to save the day with either no or circumstantial witnesses: Many of Anakin's feats during the Clone Wars; Luke blowing up the Death Star; Where(/How) Luke learned how to go from being an exceptionally lucky starfighter pilot to the badass master he becomes by RotJ; Leia offing the biggest crime boss in the galaxy, etc, etc.

The Skywalker name, the Skywalker story, is what has- and will- inspire countless beings to look up at the stars and be filled with hope.

That Legend is literally the reason Star Wars exists; A New Hope.

This applies fantastically to our world, as well; even from the beginning (a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away....) the entire collection of stories have been presented as Legends. That's actually how they used to make some of the older more troublesome Canon work (by stating that it's all down to the different retelling of the same story, or how the story was handed down through the years/evolved/came to be allegorical in some cases/what have you).

The fact that these are stories of Legends, imo, pretty much throws 'canon' out the window. There are plenty of vastly different versions of Myths all over Mythology. Using an above example; I'm sure, given a few (in-universe) months, you wouldn't be able to convince 80%+ of the galaxy (that has heard the tale) that Luke actually wasn't on Crait. There are eyewitnesses. It happened. It's a fact. Now, we (the audience (plus a few in-universe)) know that this was simply Luke giving one last Skywalker Legend to the Universe, but that doesn't make it any less real to the people he 'saved'.

In the exact same vein, who's to say, for instance, that the original death star trench run that you and I have watched countless times isn't hyperbole or propaganda? Or that it didn't happen completely differently? Maybe not at all? People have had no problem saying any number of those exact things about the Holiday Special for years now.

Every Star Wars tale- from the next big official movie to the worst poorly written fanfic- is a legend of something that you can decide for yourself if you believe it actually occurred or not. (Or, to be more technical, how ""accurate"" any portrayals of the event we have access to are)

But absolutely none of it matters when it comes to writing- or enjoying- anything else Star Wars related; especially when it comes to ""new"" content (either in terms of newly-made or simply new to you). Is there a particular character, story element, location, bit of tech, species, concept, etc (etc etc) somewhere in some Star Wars medium that you love? Awesome. Is there something in there that you hate? Also Awesome. Because the cool thing about a Legend is you get to believe what you want to believe. You get to play in the Star Wars universe you want to play in. That's beautiful.

&gt; ""Let the past die. Kill it if you have to""
&gt; 
&gt; ""We are the spark that will light the fire""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?""
&gt; 
&gt; ""That's how we're gonna win: not fighting what we hate, but saving what we love.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""There has been an Awakening... have you felt it?""

Who's to say Luke didn't have a wife named Mara? Who's to say if there was one Solo kid or multiple? Did Han shoot first, or did Greedo? Who died first, Han or Chewie? Was Han's 12 parsecs line a bluff check crit gone way out of hand? ('cause he mentioned it to a princess who told half the galaxy) Or was that an actual event that happened? Who killed the Emperor? What did Anakin's Force Ghost look like on (theforestmoonof) Endor? What song did the Ewoks play? Who didn't bawl like a baby at the end of the partnership of Ton Phanan and Garik Loran? Was it IG-88's Fault that the Second Death Star blew up? Was Boba Fett cooler before we got his backstory?

Well that last one is a definite yes. But my point is, is that Disney finally accomplished what Lucas didn't (Possibly because he couldn't, it may have been too much of his baby, too close to the heart): Disney handed Star Wars over to the imaginations of everyone who's ever grabbed a broom handle and looked up at the stars and felt that rising feeling in their chest. A Force, if you will. A Hope.

(The answers to all of the above musings are: Whatever you want them to be. Human subcultures are nested fractally, so there will always be people that feel strongly enough about every aspect of everything to argue about it; and I think that's also beautiful.)

That type of 4th wall plot development- how they pushed forward the in-universe story-line and the Real Life story of ""Star Wars"" with the same sentiment (that '***the Legend is the Spark that Inspires all of us***')- makes it streets ahead of anything else a Star Wars movie has done, in my opinion.

Never, since the first time I saw (the original) Star Wars, have I walked out of a movie feeling like absolutely anything is possible. And being that I was 6 the first time around, and 26 more recently (read: no longer (ENTIRELY) captivated by the flashing lights and the space travel and all the cool Beings), I'm impressed that this movie was able to rekindle in my heart a fire that hadn't died... it just had grown dimmer with age.

Anything is possible. Star Wars is Awesome. VIII especially.

Addendum: I really really really hope that Disney continues to release stories (in any format; movies, shows, books, comics, video games, anything) under the ""Legends"" branding. Give us a few more Adventures with Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, Corran Horn, the other Skywalker/Solo kids, and all the rest; who don't necessarily need to otherwise fit into the 'newer' (read:'canon') stories. Maybe instead of KotoR 3 (which I've honestly given up hope on them taking all the good story content from swtor and making an actual kotor 3...), Disney could hire Bioware to make a KotoR-like Legends game (Thrawn Campaign, Yuuzhan Vong War, adventures between movies IV/V, anything really). I Just want more Star Wars stories of every kind. They could capitalize on the fact that every Star Wars story is a Legend in its own right, to help push the brand. So perfectly named!

It is time to face the truth about the Prequels,"
They gave us much more then we have been giving it credit for:

- Lore (expansion of the SW-universe)
- multi (pretty epic) lightsaber battles from  jedi and sithmasters
- Amazing characters like: Windu, Qui Gon, Count Dooku and Darth Maul

And ofc **unlimited memes**. From the higher ground to dealing in absolutes.

I think its time we accept it, that the prequels actually were good, that they gave us not only fun (in the form of memes) but also epic battles and a deeper sight at how the SW universe function. I say this because i just saw TLJ, and all while it isnt a bad movie and i dont mind where its going towards, it doesnt have that SW magic, that the OT and yes also the PT did have.

I have never seen a fandom like the SW fandom (ships and humour and all),"Sorry if this is a random and weird post but just want to say I find the SW fandom fascinating and honestly fun. Im relatively new to all this, became a SW fan when TFA came out and I have since watched the OT, the prequels, caught up on novels, etc. Yes SW fans are intense and rarely satisfied but I'll be damned if yall aren't funny as hell. 

Being a SW fan is FUN. Every character has a twitter account and they respond to eachother (Emo Kylo Ren, Confused Rey, Lonely Luke, Bad Father Han Solo....even the Caretakers now) The memes are hilarious! Cant say fans aren't invested lol

And then there's the freaking shippers that are sooo passionate. I have been a part of a lot of popular fandoms (Harry Potter, Marvel, DC, etc) but boy oh boy i have never seen a mega blockbuster fandom so passionate about romance as the SW fandom. 

And like the greatest variety ever:

The most popular ship seems to be Reylo. It has a huge following and today i learned it has apparently been the top ship on tumblr since the movie came out. Thats for more than a month its been at no1. If they reylos are not happy with Ep9 i dont even wanna think about the Internet that day.

Then there's Poe and Finn

Finn and Rey

Rey and Poe

Poe and BB8 (the fuck?)

Hux and Kylo

Hux and Poe (I guess Poe and everyone at this point?)

Also, people try to bring up to me that in TLJ, she beat Luke. That’s when I just give up, because that never happened. Can someone explain to me where this thought came from?

Rey Skywalker,"A few weeks ago I read a theory that I absolutely love, and no it’s not that Rey somehow has Skywalker blood.

The theorist suggested that Luke was going to “adopt” Rey and give her the name of Skywalker. This theory states that Luke and Rey will grow close in the time between Episode 8 and 9 as Luke is finally at peace and Rey begins her journey to become a Jedi. 

This would be a great moment for Rey’s character as she is welcomed into a surrogate family, while still having her own unique identity. And it also furthers tension between Rey and Kylo.

 I’m sure Ben grew up resenting the fact that he wasn’t a “true” Skywalker. His father wasn’t Force sensitve and his mother choose not to follow the path of the Jedi. So when Kylo finds out that Rey has been given the name of “Skywalker”, he will descend further into the dark side.

Something about TLJ,"I think an overarching theme about The Last Jedi is that shit just doesn't go as planned sometimes. Star Wars has seen hundreds of stories go exactly as planned, and this movie showed us that sometimes shit happens. With Finn and Rose, their mission ended pointlessly because they acted on instinct and it turned out, by luck, that there was already another plan. For the evacuation to Crait, not all secret plans go unnoticed. The First Order saw the escape pods. That was a risk they had to take, and they lost the gamble. Also, for Luke's Jedi Order. He tried, but shit happened and it failed. I think everyone has a vision of Star Wars where the good guys always win and always get the luck, and TLJ is probably more accurate than most others. The people supplying the rebellions ships also make the tie fighters. That's life. That's just my 2 cents.",StarWars,True,1517545996,2018-02-01

Why is Hux in direct command of the fleet?,"Why is the highest ranking officer of the First Order military leading and micro managing the fleet? That would be like the Joint Chief of Staff being directly on the ships leading them IRL. Where are the FO admirals? Surely they have them right? As far as I know every Star Destory/Battlecruiser is lead by a captain with a admiral above them leading the fleet or battle group. 

It the OT we seen this. Darth Vader left his admirals and captains to their own devices as long as they completed the task. Hux doesn't seem very good at directly leading a fleet and would better doing General things. Why didn't the movie show this like the OT? 

I haven't read the novels yet, but is it different in the book?

The whole argument about Rey knowing how to use a lightsaber the first time she picks it up would make slightly more sense if she used a double-ended blue light saber and would have been so much cooler,"It would've been easy enough to work into the script. There could've been two light sabers in the chest for example... anyway.

Rey is seen fighting a bit with her staff just before meeting Finn so we know more or less she's a decent fighter. Fighting with a double ended BLUE lightsaber is a fresh twist that I think would have been well accepted by fans. Not to mention making the win against with Ren more plausible.

And one little cherry one the sunday (Although completely  impossible but hey, it's fun to dream...) Would be if Maul, my personal favorite fighter of all of SW, would show up somehow somewhere like he did in Ep 1 when the doors opened and battle it out with Rey. Double saber to double saber.

As Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are entering Tattooine(no clue how to spell that) I noticed Qui-Gon said to Obi-Wan that he “felt a disturbance in the force”. To disclaim, I never really thought much of that line and honestly thought they were referring to Darth Maul, until I realized that the disturbance was actually Anakin. Maul was in Coruscant with Sidious while they discussed this and he had still yet to arrive in Tattooine, so I highly doubt that the two Jedi were referring to him, but it all makes sense now. I think Qui-Gon’s liking for the boy blinded his judgement with him and inevitably caused all the dominos to fall in line.

Is Rey overpowered?(Force abilities analysis),"I know this topic's been done to death but I just wanted to share my two bits on it. Feel free to disagree.

A lot of people point out the *Darkness rises and light to meet it* line but to me that only justifies the raw power and as we now raw power =/= force abilities without training otherwise Anakin and Luke wouldn't have required so much training. Some say that unlike Luke Rey believed in the force and that's why she's able to do all this stuff but if that was so then all the members of the Jedi Order would have become OP very fast. 
I'm only gonna be discussing the *force feats* displayed by Rey not her skills and stuff.

**TFA**- Rey knows basic combat and some survival skills but doesn't know much about the force.

* **1**.Reading Kylo's mind-
Kylo was at the time reading Rey's mind and many people have theorized that mind reading is sort of like a two way road and Rey using her strong connection to the force was able to read his mind. We don't know much about how it works so I guess it's not too much of a stretch for her to do that. 
OP-Maybe

* **2**.Mind tricking the stormtrooper-
It has been previously kinda established that mind trick require practice and training. Luke was only able to do it in ROTJ and Ezra failed multiple times to do it even after some years since he began training while Rey was able to do it quite easily.
OP-Yes

* **3**.Force pulling the lightsaber-
Even after 3 years and some training it took Luke a lot of effort to pull the lightsaber so it's certainly not easy but the thing is that the lightsaber seemed to be calling out to Rey such that as soon as she reached out for it it flew into her hands instead of Kylo's.
OP-No

* **4**.Defeating Kylo-
Kylo was conflicted after killing Han, shot by the crossbow and injured a lil bit by Finn, all of which made him weak. Rey had basic combat training ,was in tune with the force, used the dark side a bit near the end of the fight and the lightsaber seemed to choose her. So I think her beating Kylo is reasonable.
OP-No

**TLJ**- The only thing Luke taught Rey was how to feel the force and stuff so she didn't exactly train much.

* **5**.Force pulling Kylo's lightsaber in the throne room-
This time the lightsaber wasn't calling out to her but she had gotten a bit more experience so it's okay I guess.
OP-Maybe

* **6**.Defeating Snoke's guards-
Rey had some basic combat training and was in tune with the force  which gave her a slight advantage but the elite guards were well experts. Grevious and Kreel(SW comics) who were  non-force sensitive lightsaber experts easily defeated Jedi Knights and post-ANH Luke respectively . However some people have argued that Rey only battled the guards one on one and fought instinctively but still those guys were trained so well that even Kylo struggled with them.
OP-Yes

* **7**.Force tug of war-
Rey and Kylo's raw power is equal and  that's what it signified. Rey clearly somehow knows to force pull and their tug of war was interrupted pretty quick so I guess it's okay.
OP-No

* **8**.Lifting the boulders-
While it's true that Yoda said that size doesn't matter it's also true that he struggled with the rocks in AOTC and not every Jedi pulls down a Star Destroyer. Yoda also said that moving the stones and the X-Wing was only different in the mind of the individual and that Luke must unlearn what he has learned and believe that size doesn't matter. So it takes a lot of concentration and training so that in your mind size really stops mattering and you can lift big things. Rey hasn't been trained much and unlike Luke she wasn't even taught that size doesn't matter.
OP-Yes

**RESULT**- Analyzing the movies logically Rey is OP but not as much as some claim. The problem is that the way the scenes were portrayed it felt like the force awakened in Rey and so she's able to do all this kick-ass stuff without any training or justification and is now an equal to Kylo both in raw power and skill. Some people are okay with that explanation and like it but I personally don't.

**tl;dr**-Please read the whole thing or don't bother commenting.

“Destiny” as a concept in the Star Wars universe,"Do you guys think destiny is a literal thing in a Star Wars, or is it just what the inhabitants of its universe believe in?

You have Anakin, who the Jedi believed was destined to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the force, which I guess he did in a very roundabout way.

Then Obi Wan, Who tells Luke “Your destiny lies along a different path from mine. The Force will be with you, always.”

So clearly Obi Wan believes in destiny, even after Anakin failed to live up to his?

Later on Obi Wan tells Luke “You cannot escape your destiny. You must face Darth Vader again.”

A much more aggressive form of destiny than he talked about before, it’s not even a choice.

Both the Jedi and the Sith, light and dark side users believe in destiny. Since Sidious, Vader and Snoke all have dialogue regarding it too.

Despite this widespread belief, it does seem more often than not those “destined” to do something either don’t do it, or do it in completely unexpected ways. Like Luke redeeming Vader instead of destroying him and Sidious himself.

So anyway, do you guys believe destiny as a concept exists in the Star Wars universe, or is it just a belief system?

For fate to turn the light on


Your life little girl

That men will want to write on

To write on

You are 16 going on 17

Better beware

Be canny and careful

Baby you're on the brink


You are 16 going on 17

Fellows will fall in line

Eager young lads

And grueways and cads

Will offer you food and wine


Totally unprepared are you

To face a world of men

Timid and shy and scared are you

Of things beyond your kin


You need someone

Older and wiser

Telling you what to do

I am 17 going on 18

I'll take care of you

Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet

And willingly I believe


I am 16 going on 17 innocent as a rose

Bachelor dandies

Drinkers of brandies

What do I know of those?


Totally unprepared am I

To face a world of men

Timid and shy and scared am I

Of things beyond your ken

Telling me what to do

What just occured to me about Leia.......,"We're introduced to Leia as the princess of Alderaan, born into the House of Organa, right? That implies that she comes from a long line of nobility, her parents being stratospherically high up on the galactic social hierarchy. Of course, it’s revealed in Return of the Jedi that Vader is her father and Luke, her brother (spoilers, for anybody who's been living in a nuclear fallout shelter for 35 years on a Heinz beans and water diet). However, the original trilogy concludes with Luke and Leia's mother remaining a mystery, being widely open to imaginative interpretation for audiences in 1983. 

This gave me an idea for a much more interesting angle for how Anakin and Padme's relationship could have gone in the prequels, an idea that’s actually pretty damn obvious once you think about it. In fact, I’m positive that somebody else has already thought of my idea, but I’ll continue anyway since I’m already 150 words into this shit. Instead of Padme ""Amidala"" being a former queen of Naboo who gets Force choked to death on a lava planet by her highly emotional, easily manipulated, fallen Jedi husband, whom she had to secretly marry because the Order has ass-backwards bans on general happiness, try this: 

Padme IS a member of House Organa who feel in love with Anakin Skywalker, the mighty knight with a gentle soul and keen mind, but their relationship was looked down upon by the aristocratic elite. Though the Jedi are greatly revered by Alderaanian nobles for their service to the Republic, their modest and humble ways make them be seen akin to the servant/working class of galactic society (which could play as sort of a humorous irony since the Jedi transcend the socio-economic pyramid, hence are able to move about it in ways the elite cannot). I think this is a superior illustration of the forbidden love that Lucas was aiming for. 

Also, perhaps the hurt from this artificial class divide that kept him from his lover stayed with Anakin ever after he became Vader, hence why he gave noble-born Imperial governors and officers the same strict, no-nonsense treatment as the low level Stormtrooper grunts.",StarWars,True,1517593307,2018-02-02
Anyone know how to give the new SW movies that “old” look?,"I don’t really know how to describe this, but recently I watched a scene from RotS where Anakin asked Padme to join him. The video was uploaded like 10 years ago, so the quality was low. But in the middle of it I almost got a sense like I was watching a Star Wars movie that was made back when the OT came out. The quality gave it that Old School look. I liked it, in a weird way. I clicked on TLJ trailer, and attempted to change the quality to the lowest possible form, but it did nothing but just made it look bad. It was like a really bad. It was just pixels. So does anyone know if anybody has given the new Star Wars movies that Old School look?",StarWars,True,1517593820,2018-02-02

---------

“Ben,” Luke called out calmly to his pupil. Ben Solo sat atop the stairs of the Grand Audience Chamber of the Massassi Temple, cross legged and meditating. Luke slowly approached from behind. 

“Hello Master,” Ben replied. His voice was dry and melancholic. “Shocking to see you up so late.”

“I… felt a disturbance. In the force. In you, Ben. It woke me from my sleep.” Luke approached calmly, taking slow and calculated steps.  

“Ah,” Ben said rather simply. “No doubt you have felt my confliction. That’s why I’m here, following your teachings, to meditate in times of conflict. You know this… so why are you here?”

“I’m here because I’m worried Ben. I… I know that he has been reaching out to you through the force. I’ve felt him myself, even your mother has.”

“He speaks of nothing I don’t already know… What I have already been wondering.”

Luke stopped before the first step, sighing quietly to himself. “You’re powerful, Ben. You have nothing to fear. If you fight him, fight the darkness, you will win every time. I know it.”

“It’s as you say, isn’t it Master? The force is strong in our family. A family chosen by the Force to keep balance.”

Luke smiled confidently. “You’re going to make a great Grand Master one day, Ben.” Ben twitched sharply at the thought. Luke noticed, raising an eyebrow puzzlingly. No, Luke thought. I have faith in him. He’ll be alright. Luke began to turn on his heel to leave Ben to his meditation. Halfway during his turn, however, Ben asked,

“Master, why did you name me?”

Luke, froze in place. After a beat, he turned his head back to face where Ben sat. Luke felt a spike of dark side energy. “Obi-Wan was an integral part of my life. He sacrificed so much for me and your parents. Brought us all together, really.”

“You misunderstand me, Master,” Ben interjected with just a hint of scorn in his voice. “Why did you, name me. My mother only saw Kenobi ten seconds before he died, and my father called him an old cook more times than I can count. My parents have no strong feelings for him, so they can’t be the ones who named me. You were. Tell me why.”

Luke swallowed harshly. “You… your birth was… a surprise to them, Ben. Neither of them were particularly prepared to be parents. They had no names planned.” Luke closed his eyes, living the moment again with the force. “I was there, though. Even then, right after your birth, I could feel the force surrounding you. I insisted they name you Ben.”

“And they just went along with it. Just like that. Without a care.”

Luke shifted his footing uncomfortably. “They trusted my judgement.”

“Mother always did trust your judgement, didn’t she? She trusted you to take me away. Trusted you to be the parent they never were. To raise me as a Skywalker.”

“It’s in your blood, Ben,” Luke said proudly. “You are a Skywalker.”

“I am a Solo!” Ben screamed, violently standing from his meditation and turning towards Luke with clenched fists. Luke didn’t falter.  “Ben,” he pleaded. “Calm your mind. This anger is not the Jedi way.”

“Has it ever crossed your wise and powerful mind that I do not care about your Jedi Order?!”
“You don’t mean that,” Luke shook his head. “You can’t mean that.”

“I never wanted to be a Jedi. I never wanted to be a Grand Master. I never wanted to be The Chosen One, and I never wanted to be a Skywalker!”

“Then what? You want to be a politician like your mother? Your force abilities would alienate you from office out of fear, just like Leia! Or what, be a scoundrel like your father? I know he must sound like an exciting man, but you don’t know him Ben.”

“And why do think that is, Master?! I was never home!”

“Neither was Han, Ben!” Luke screamed.

Ben Solo took a powerful step forward, shaking the entire temple with the force as he ignited his blue lightsaber from his hip. He grit his teeth in abomination.

Luke was appalled. “That was my saber,” he stated in disbelief. “That was my father’s saber. You’d use that… against me? I scavenged Bespin to give that to you! For you, Ben!’

Ben gripped the saber firmly in his hand, examining it closely. He felt the force swell through its brilliant blue light. He could feel the duel at Bespin, the Battle at Mustafar… and the slaughter at the Jedi Temple. The saber slipped from his fingers, and Ben watched as it bounced and rolled down the cold, stone steps of the chamber, until finally it spun against Luke’s boots. “I don’t want it,” he said coldly.

Luke stood in disbelief, starring heartbrokenly into his nephew’s eyes. He slowly knelt down to take the saber in his own hands, never looking away from Ben. A single tear ran down his face. Ben softened at his uncle gaze for a moment, but with a blink of his eyes grew colder and more resolved. He began walking down the steps of the chamber. Luke began to walk up. Ben angled himself to move past but Luke gently pressed the dormant saber against Ben’s chest. 

“This lightsaber is our legacy, Ben. This is your destiny.”

Ben stood there for a moment, not looking at his uncle, but past him. “I’ll find my own destiny.” He pushed past Luke and descended the steps, walking towards the temple’s entrance. The other students, awakened by the temple’s shaking, soon flood the chamber.

“Master Skywalker, what was that?” Jaden asked.

“Where is Ben going?” Revan followed up.

“Nowhere,” Luke announced, following Ben closely.

Ben snapped turning on his heel with clenched fists. “You don’t control me, old man!”

“You can’t turn your back on the Force, Ben. This is its will, can’t you see that?”

“The “light” side of the force, right? You preach the light side as peace and compassion, but you know what I see? Pride, vanity, and a lust for control! The Jedi are flawed, you’re the one who can’t see.”

“Excuse me Master,” Galen started, “But I think Ben has a point. I’ve felt held back since I began training, like I can do more.”

There was a long pause and an exchange of glances between all of the students. They all knew the next few words could change everything.

“Now that you mention it, Ben’s ideas always made sense to me,” Jada spoke. “You masters haven’t really explained why it’s wrong.”

“Whoa everyone, calm down,” Jaden interrupted. “We have been over this. The dark side is only the corruption of the light.”

“That’s a lie, isn’t it?” Ben questioned. “Propaganda to keep the Order in check. Under control.”

“Okay, come on Ben. Where’s this coming from?” Kyle asked.

“From him,” Luke answered. “This isn’t you, Ben, is it? It can’t be. He’s in your head.”

Ben laughed. “It’s impossible for your Chosen One to have a mind of his own, of course. I’m leaving old man. And if any of you all want to have free will too then follow me.”

“You’re beginning to sound like a Sith, Ben!” Rosh erupted, igniting his Yellow lightsaber.

“Is this the Jedi way? Ready to kill anyone with a trace of the dark side? Anyone that’s not brainwashed yet? I’m no one’s prisoner!” Revan ignited his purple saber.

“Don’t make us do this!” Jaden cried, igniting his dual green and purple sabers. Kyle followed Jaden and filed in in front of Luke with Rosh and others. Galen, Revan, and others ignited their sabers and stood beside Ben.

“You don’t want to be a Jedi, you don’t want to be a Skywalker… Tell me, what do you want?”

Ben eyed both the blue lightsaber in Luke’s hand, and the Green one attached to his hip. “A choice” he said.

Luke nodded. “And now you’ve made it?”

Ben swallowed hard. “It’s as my mother feared, after all. I’m too much like my grandfather. Too much like my father. You failed her as a brother. You failed me as a teacher.  And you failed Yoda as a Jedi Master.” Ben raised his hand with his palm facing Luke. “I always hated you.”

Luke took a moment, and grabbed his saber with his free hand. The entire chamber tensed. Ben focused the force into the palm of his outstretched hand, ready to defend himself. All of his students knew that if Luke attacked, anyone who faced against his saber would fall.  After a second, Luke threw both sabers to either side. Ben was puzzled and taken aback by his Master’s actions, but did not let his guard down.

“You were a son to me Ben,” he said. “I loved you.”

Were, Ben repeated in his mind, closing his eyes. The word resonated for an eternity. The conflict that word brought was more than he could bare. Eternity was cut short, however, by the finality and resolution of another word. Loved.
   
Ben’s eyes opened wide.

He blasted Luke with a concentrated, direct Force Push, sending him and stone debris crumbling through the wall of the temple behind him. The remaining Jedi pounced in retaliation, and Ben’s followers finished them all as the temple burned and crumbled in the downpour.



YEARS LATER


Luke stood alone overlooking a steep cliff. Looking down at the crushing waves against jagged rocks. He thought, as he always did, about how Ben was right. The pride and vanity of the Jedi was obvious now. The order was not without flaws, as he once thought. The order failed his father, turning him into Darth Vader, and now the order has failed Ben, turning him into Kylo Ren. He found the First Jedi Temple, the Journal of The Whills. He learned a new understanding of the force, perhaps a new way to teach that can prevent what happened to Ben and his father from happening again. He could face Snoke. He may even be able to defeat him.

But he couldn’t face Ben. If he couldn’t face him with hate, and he already tried facing him with love. What else could he do? What hope was there?

But then he heard someone. Footsteps from behind. And then, a presence. One he hasn’t felt since…

Her. A girl approached him, hope in her eyes. She reached into her bag, and pulled out a lightsaber. His father’s lightsaber. His lightsaber. She reached out to Luke, handing him his saber. He took it in his hands, the memories of that day and many others flowing through his mind. Finally, the saber slipped through his fingers, bouncing off a rock and down the hill where the girl walked up. 

“I don’t want it,” he said coldly.

[general discussion] [spoilers] Would TLJ Luke be more widely accepted in the context of an anthology film?,"So I can start right off the bat by saying I enjoyed Luke's portrayal in TLJ.  But overall I am of the mindset that I would have preferred that the new Lucasfilm had focused on making Anthology films instead of a direct follow-up to the OT.  In my opinion, that is the more interesting route to take and I also think it is a better idea to leave the main story alone because it's perfect the way it is and you're always going to run the risk of dividing the fans by revisiting it, which it clearly has done in this case.

That got me thinking about what if we got the opportunity to explore the Luke we got in TLJ throughout the course of an entire movie?  Strip away the context of the First Order/Resistance conflict and just cut to the heart of the Luke exile story, repenting for the attempted murder of his nephew and apprentice and being called to action by a young and idealistic new force-user.  Would the story work and would it have been more well-received?  I guess the key factor would be that we would be seeing significantly more of Luke, and Kylo and Rey would more function as a B-plot in Luke's story versus the other way around.  Also we wouldn't have had to suffer through the anticipation post-TFA of trying to figure out why Luke was in exile.  ",StarWars,True,1517598203,2018-02-02

Idea for Mara Jade like character for New Canon,"In my idea ""Mara Jade"" would be daughter of Palpatine. so it would give her good reasons to avenge Emperor and Empire (she could even had own Sentinel) and good reason why she became Emperor's Hand, and only ""MJ"", Palpatine later Luke, Leia would know that she is his daughter.


In the same time it would give more character development for Palpatine because we could see what kind of father he was, I personally think that he would be a ""good"" father because for him ""MJ"" woud be investment as a heir of the Sith legacy after his death, but in the same time could be shown that he is still a piece of shit because we would see that he had many wives (in Henry VIII style) who would have miscarriages, so even as his daughter he hate her (because she was a woman, because she will not be able to pass his family name to the next generations) also he care about own blood that she had and in the same time it would show that for him Vader was just a tool, I know that this isn't some new revelation but still it would show (especially if ""MJ"" was older then Luke) that Veder after everything he went through he was just a pawn nothing more. 


I personally think that character feel stronger if he decides by himself to do something without forcing by something, so giving good reasons to kill Luke without using ""Palpatine's final command"" would be a good distinction from legends.


After after marriage with Luke they would have at least two kids (balance), maybe first older (similar to Rey) and then twins later.
About **""[Kylo Ren slaughter](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Destruction_of_Luke_Skywalker%27s_Jedi)*""**, I imagine that she survived the attack and then she would train her children in secret.


also after we know how are made red kyber crystals in new canon (by ""[Bleeding](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bleeding)""). So I had idie how create her iconic purple lightsaber. One of the ways to create color purple is by [adding two colors **RED** and **BLUE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple), therefore she could kill Jedi who was using blue saber turn crystal into red by bleeding process but after she becomes jedi/good kyber crystal could ""heal"" and slowly turn purple (or she could use Palpatine's lightsaber which luckily could be at first blue). It could also explain why Mace Windu also have purple lightsaber because he was also using dark side and he could accidentally or not using slowly ""bleeding"" and turn from blue into purple.

"Why Sith ghosts don't really break George Lucas' ""No Sith Ghosts Rule""","

    ""Eternal life… The ultimate goal of the Sith, yet they can never achieve it; it comes only through the release of self, not the exaltation of self. It comes through compassion, not greed. Love is the answer to the darkness.""

""Who wan't to live forever?"" Well apparently the Sith do. Some like Darth Plagueis even dedicate their whole life to it. Yet it is something that escapes them. True eternal life is a state that the Sith can not accomplish.

Some people see this quote and Luca's statement as a blanket statement. As something that would make the likes of Exar Kun's spirit or the ghosts of the Sith Lords on Korriban or Palpatine's spirit clash with George's vision.

But I disagree. I think their is a reason why they can exist and why it doesn't really clash. Its something that is actually really poetic in a way. And it deals with what one means by eternal life and what the difference between a Force Ghost and a Ghost/Spirit is.

First I will start off with the after life bit. The Force in Star Wars follows a lot of Buddhist and East Asian teachings. One of those is how the afterlife works. In death a person becomes one with the force. They stop existing as a conscious person with thoughts and feelings like in Western Philosophy but as another part of the living/Universal force.

The only exception to the rule being Jedi who have learned a technique to maintain their identity after death by becoming fully one with the force and some other things we don't really know.

So we know that and they are right that no Sith could become a force ghost. They would never release their mind and will to the force. Would never humble their self like that. Its the opposite of the Sith practice of taking control of the force and turning it to their grasp.

But the Sith Ghosts we see aren't like that. They didn't give their-self over to the force when they died. Instead they did something very Sith like. They fought back against death and became something else. A Ghost yes but not the same kind of ghost that the Jedi become.

The Sith ghosts we see are all bound to something. Exar Kun bound his spirit to a temple on Yavin IV. Freedom Nadd to a temple on Onderon, the ancient Sith Lords to their temples on Korriban, and even Murr to the Murr Talisman (The cause of the Rakghoul plague).

Non of these Ghosts at any point became one with the force. Their spirit never left the mortal plain and joined in with the force. Instead their spirit became attached to something and reliant on that things existence for its survival. Force Ghosts are not bound to any one place or item and yet these ghosts are.

A second thing that says the Sith Ghosts are different from Force Ghosts is that they can be killed. As far as we are aware you can not kill a Force Ghost because once again they are a part of the force. But a Sith Ghost you can kill it. Either by defeating the ghost its self and banishing it (Exar Kun) or by destroying what it is bound to (Murr).

The fact that you can kill or banish a Sith Ghost shows right there that it is something different than the Force Ghosts that Obi-wan, Yoda, and Qui-gon obtain.

Also their are two things in the NEU that point towards it being possible. The first are the Nightsisters. Now the Nightsisters are not Sith but they do use the darkside. Yes its called magic in TCW show but Filioni eventually retconed it because to him all ""magic"" is just a aspect of the force.

Both groups use the darkside to fuel their powers. The only thing that separates them are titles and philosophy. And yet in Rebels we see ghosts/spirits of the Nightsisters (they even possess some of the crew). How can they exist if they are pulling on the same power as the Sith? Because like the Sith ghosts I described earlier they are bound to the cave. They can not leave it nor are they one with the force.

The second thing is Rur who much like Murr (Or Callista) uploaded his mind into a computer (in rur's case a crystal and in Murr's his talisman) His conciousnes/spirit exists after death even though he has not become one with the force.

So the "" So sith ghosts rule"" still works works with the sith ghosts because they never reach a true eternal life. They never reach force heaven and join with the force. It should really be a ""No Sith Force Ghost"" rule because the best they can achieve is some dim mirror of being immortal by binding with a physical object and then they are stuck in that place and at the mercy of disapearing if its destroyed.

And in fact sith fighting death and binding theirself to an object to survive instead of moving on plays right into their exalatation of self and their greed. Its very poetic. Because of their desire for control and to live they miss out on a true eternal life and true enlightenment.

TLDR: Sith Ghosts aren't Force Ghosts because they don't exist from becoming one with the force. They are a different kind of spirit who exist by binding theirself to a location

Thoughts on the Obi-Wan movie...,"I really don't get why everyone is so into the idea of an Obi-Wan movie...

I know it’s easy to knock the Solo movie, I’ve certainly made my share of negative comments already. However, it’s coming and we’re going to get what we’re going to get - no reason not to support it and get excited over a new Star Wars film.

Here’s some things I’m hoping to see:
- Childish Calrissian - enough said
- I like the idea that Boba Fett could be to Solo as Vader was to Rogue One. I’d love to see a menacing, badass Fett for a couple of scenes with minimum dialog.
- Might get to see more of the Falcon, explore some areas that we haven’t seen before.
- Getting to see a newer, more shiny Falcon.
- There’s bound to be some cool space battles and chases
- More pre-OT Empire. It’s always cool to see how the Empire transitions into its role of dominance.
- Lots of opportunities for bounty hunters and other underground characters to pop up - may be cool to see Cad Bane, Embo, or Hondo make an appearance.
- Probably going to get a lot of new and classic aliens popping up.

Shmi = Plagueis = Snoke (I'm serious),"You think I'm insane. I'm not. Just give it a quick skim please!

After rewatching the prequels, I got the feeling that Shmi was a little sketchy. I mean, everything about her was mysterious and odd.

She told Qui-Gon that Anakin didn't have a father, that he was immaculately conceived. *I call bullshit, Star Wars Virgin Mary.*

She willingly gave up her son to the Jedi ""because he'd have a better life"" with them. Such a good guise, tbh. 

Shmi Skywalker was pulling strings all along. We have no idea where she came from, because ""she"" didn't come from anywhere. She was Darth Plagueis the Wise all along, disguised as a change-in (or whatever that bounty hunter in AOTC was called).

Plagueis cut a deal with the Hutts to allow him to pose as a slave woman on Tattooine while actually maintaing his freedom. While raising Anakin as a mother figure, he was planting the seeds of the dark side within him all along. 

Plagueis and Palpatine created Anakin out of the Force - pretty much as a Force experiment. They wanted him to train with the Jedi to master the light side, before becoming totally immersed in the dark side later on. The most powerful Force being in the galaxy mastering both sides of the Force *and* being thrown into a situation that (by their calculations) would slowly drive him to rebel against the lopsided Jedi ideals was all part of the master plan.

Sometime during or after the events of The Phantom Menace, after Anakin was handed over to the Jedi, Plagueis left Tattooine and rejoined Palpatine. While he was gone, Palpatine had taken on a new apprentice (Darth Maul) and sought to become the master of the Sith. Palpatine attacked Plagueis in his sleep, rendering him useless. Because Plagueis is basically immortal (can save himself from dying), he survived and fled back to Tattooine, where he posted as a slave again to be ""liberated"" by the Lars homestead. Now, he and Palpatine were in a race of getting Anakin as their apprentice.

By the time of AOTC, Plagueis reached out to Anakin in his dreams, showing him his ""mother"" dying. He knew Anakin would seek her out, and posing as his mother, Plagueis just *conveniently* ""died"" in the Tusken Raider hut when Anakin arrived. He knew Anakin would embrace the dark side and kill all the Tusken Raiders. He then fled to the Unknown Regions as Palpatine discovered his whereabouts (by tracking Anakin).

He did the same thing with Padme in ROTS, except that he didn't pose as Padme - he just showed the inevitable, that Padme would die in childbirth for some unspecified reason. Palpatine used the story of Darth Plagueis and his abilities to manipulate Anakin into thinking he could save Padme using the dark side of the Force. Palpatine and Plagueis were further competing, as the former used the latter as a ploy to get Anakin to his side.

Palpatine used manipulation in the form of lofty promises based on his former master's (Plagueis) abilities, and by exploiting Anakin's anger toward the Jedi for not promoting him/the Republic and Jedi for not avoiding the Clone Wars that Anakin disagreed with. Meanwhile, Plagueis was reaching out to Anakin through the Force, manipulating him to believe that he could save his family while also making him believe he failed to save them, so he would turn to the dark side and join Plagueis when they eventually made contact with each other.

Plagueis ultimately lost, though, and Palpatine secured Anakin as his apprentice. Plagueis had to keep a low profile during the Empire's reign, because he was still weak and fragile from being brutally attacked by Palpatine years before. Palpatine knew Plagueis survived and was out in the Unknown Regions, but he also knew Plagueis was frail and was not a threat any longer. He decided to strategically used Plagueis as a failsafe, as a fallback plan, this way if the Empire and/or Palpatine ever fell, Plagueis was the one guy with all the knowledge on how to rebuild it.

Plagueis attempted to reach out to Luke during the original trilogy, since he, too, was a Skywalker and therefore a descendant of Plagueis's Force creation. Luke was too pure, though, so Plagueis gave up.

Fast-forward to the sequel trilogy era, and Plagueis - now using the name Snoke (as a result of keeping a low profile during the Empire's reign) and finally embracing his true physical form again (no more change-in forms) - was on a quest to start a new dark side regime, one in which he wouldn't be so easily overthrown by a single apprentice (the Sith Rule of Two is what killed him, so he sought to end that by taking on many apprentices). He targeted and ultimately trained/manipulated many young people (the Acolytes of the Beyond and Knights of Ren), including Ben Solo, another descendant of his Force creation. That's why Snoke was so obsessed with the ""potential of his bloodline."" 

Ruling the First Order, Snoke was on top of his game again, despite being crippled. He made sure to enlist the Praetorian Guards so he could ensure he would never be attacked like Palpatine attacked him years earlier. He was never worried about dying, though, as evidenced by him saying ""I can't be beaten"" in TLJ.

When Ben sliced him in half with the Skywalker lightsaber, he was finally killed for good. The explanation for why the immortal Plagueis/Snoke had finally died? Anakin had put all of his essence into the kyer crystal in that lightsaber, and thus, the Force creation's essence was the one thing capable of destroying the creator *of* the Force creation.

That is why Snoke/Plagueis is finally dead (and also why he was Shmi).",StarWars,True,1517640285,2018-02-03
Rey’s outfit timeline,"Rey’s outfit changes in the movie aren’t as dramatic as I’ve been hearing, and I just put the pieces together and thought I’d share because that’s what we do here: obsess over details and impatiently wait for the next movie. 

We’re all familiar with her TFA outfit, so I won’t go over it. She changed at the end of TFA, by changing pants and swapping her scarf wrapping for a vest. She kept her shirt, boots, arm wrappings, and hair style. In TLJ, when she goes in the pond with the dark side vision and then yells at Luke in the rain, her hair comes down and she’s soaking wet. She hops in the falcon and finds herself at Ben’s side in like 4 hours, which isn’t enough time to have washed and dried her clothes so she switches to fresh clothes (that, like the other pants and vest, she presumably got from the rebels). I just rewatched TLJ tonight and figured out that the confusion over her outfit change is misplaced and it has nothing to do with trying to seduce Ben, it’s just that her clothes got all wet and she needed new ones. Does it hurt that they’re in her usual style and comfortable to fight in? No, it’s just Rey’s fashion sense. In the end she’s wearing boots like everyone else’s, not desert boots (do they remind anyone else of Uggs?). Her clothes are made of heavier materials, which makes sense for not being in the desert. She’s wearing darker colors, which makes sense because everyone else in the resistance does so of course that’s what they have to offer.

Anakin's Tortured Soul,"So I'm watching Attack of the Clones (for the first time in a few years) and something occurred to me about Empire Strikes Back... Anakin, remembering how he had been summoned to his mother because of the tortures the Tusken Raiders subjected her to, realized that the only way to summon his own son was to torture someone close to him.

Let's put this into context: working under the Emperor has become so awful that the only way Anakin figures he can effect a coup is to summon his son by torturing his friend, and only so that he can get close enough to tell him his plan in the hope that Luke accepts his proposal without needlessly burning any other bridges in the process.

Of course, the Emperor didn't care even when he figured it all out, and in the end, Anakin had to do the job himself when he realized that this was going about as well as the previous attempt to confront the tyrant. There was simply no good reason to let Luke go the same way Mace Windu did, and tossing the treacherous old fart over a balcony seemed reasonably just at that point.",StarWars,True,1517642880,2018-02-03

THE SLIPPERS WERE GOING TO BE MENTIONED IN TLJ!

In The Art of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, costume supervisor David Crossman revealed that Snoke was originally going to talk about his slippers in the movie, but the piece of dialogue was removed from the final cut.


""I think the slipper line is gone from the film, but Snoke definitely mentioned them at one point. Ian Jones, our props maker, handmade him some gold, embroidered slippers. The reference guide we were using in the shots had huge feet. Ian, who is very clever, just made them from scratch.""―David Crossman[src]

My Take On Lucasfilm's Overall Direction *SPOILERS*,"It's disastrous.

First, let me preface by stating I did like FA and TLJ, however, as time has gone on I have reflected back on certain aspects of the way the sequel trilogy is being handled and I have issues. Issues that could have been prevented had Lucasfilm actually gave a shit.

Let me explain;

- Issue 1, **World Building**. When FA plays, people are confused as to who The Resistance is vs who the Republic is. The only information given to us is in the opening crawl;

*With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a Resistance...*

First, when did the Republic actually help? Secondly this isn't very clear, is Leia leading the Republic to resist the First Order? Back in A New Hope, we got one throw away comment during a board room meeting on the Death Star introducing the Emperor, that one quick note that was clear, precise and gave us all we needed to know. *The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.*

It was never mentioned again and yet, from this we knew that there was an overall leadership, Vader was not the top of the line nor was Tarkin, and that there was no force left to fight the Empire - they were now in control of the galaxy.

However, with the entire Republic/Resistance - this left questions for the average movie goer when trying to understand The Force Awakens. Who were the people on the planet? What planets were destroyed? Where is the Republic? Is Leia leading them or are they a band of people working in tandem with the Republic?

Now, I know these answers, as do most of you who read the books or follow the sub-reddit. However, the average fan or movie goer does not read this sub-reddit religiously nor do they go out to find the books or comics and so on. I see time and time again (and still to this day) about people asking this question.

Did you know Holdo was an important person like Leia and Admiral Ackbar? No? Read the book. Did you know Phasma's eye being revealed from her cracked helmet was a big deal? No? Read the book and comic series that followed.

No one should have to follow various extra mediums to understand a story and although Lucas never had these issues plague his OT and PT, the ST seems to not care about giving answers. ""Want to know what X is? Go read Y, it came out last week, just in time before the new movie.""

This leads into the second issue I have;

- Issue 2, **Consistency**. Marvel, with Kevin Feige, has an overall plan. Each movie takes place in a shared universe, one affecting what happens in the next movie. Regardless of if it is a different cast, characters who are in previous movies show up, events that happened in previous movies are referenced and do effect the next movie. The Marvel Universe keeps everything in order so nothing really contradicts what has become before, no matter if one movie was Iron Man and the next was Thor.

With Lucasfilm, no such plan is being used. Every movie has gotten its own director with their own vision of the film, which they have been given free reign to re-write as they see fit.

JJ began with FA, he created a story where Luke Skywalker had vanished. Rey's background seemed of importance which gave us the entire segment at Maz's Castle. Snoke was a mysterious villain that may have had a past. Knights of Ren anyone?

Rian began writing TLJ as FA was being filmed, it was now his task to answer those big questions; Rey's Parents? What to do with Luke? Snoke? Knights of Ren? C3PO's red arm?

That's unfair to Rian and he did what I think a lot of people in his position would do, he dropped them all. Why bother trying to come up with an answer for Rey's parents? Just say they don't matter. Snoke? Well, the Emperor was given no backstory. he just sort of shows up and then dies, so do the same thing here. Knights of Ren? Pass.

This becomes polarizing for the fans. This is one of the big issues a lot of fans had was the fact that we had these questions set before us only to have them tossed to the side. The fundamental points made in the previous movie have zero impact on the continuing adventures. It feels like a side-step, as if each director/writer is telling their own version of the same story and the pieces just don't seem to fit. 

All of it because no one has a plan. It's downright lazy, in fact, on how all of it has been coming together. Chewie and Leia don't hug let alone greet one another after Han's passing? Lazy. JJ admitted this was a mistake.

NO SHIT. Any casual fan could tell you this wasn't right, yet a director making how much money doesn't catch it?

Ackbar going out offscreen and his passing mentioned in a voice over. Again, any casual fan could see something may have been wrong with that. The editor of TLJ admitted it was a mistake a few weeks back.

NO SHIT.

How can we make these obvious, easy mistakes on a 200mil plus budgeted movie. This isn't a ""Oh, the mic was in screen"" or ""Mark called Carrie by her real name"" mistakes. These are full on decisions about characters fans know and love, so much so they are pop culture icons. People this smart should not have made these mistakes in the first place.

Lazy. Yet, had we an overall plan, a story arc to know how he trilogy begins, where it leads, and how it ends, we might be able to fill in the gaps and prevent issues like this.

And this leads me to the third and final issue;

- Issue three, **Luke Skywalker**. First, I'll say, no this isn't about how he was portrayed. This isn't about how he ended the movie or about green milk. I was fine with all of that.

My issue is about world building and consistency. Both of those problems create the third problem. Allow me to explain;

Sadly, as you all know, Carrie Fisher had passed away, and she did so after filming all of her parts for TLJ. Much respect to her and God Bless her soul, may she rest in piece.

I had a feeling after FA came out, a theory of how the sequel trilogy was going to play out and TLJ only confirmed my suspicions. Along with the new cast, the three original players were going to get one movie in which their character would be closed.

Force Awakens was about Han and we did see him pass. TLJ was about Luke and we did see him pass. We have been told that Leia played a significant role in Ep 9 which tells me... Ep 9 was about Leia and she would most likely pass on as well.

Now the actress' death causes an issue. Except, had Lucasfilm paid attention, had an overall plan, looked at the world they were creating and were consistent (see how that comes together?), they would not be in this problem right now.

Luke was the focal point of this trilogy. He was being searched for in Force Awakens. He was meant to be argued with and fought against in TLJ. In the final act, Ep 9, he should have come back to help out. Let Luke sacrafice himself for Leia and Han and Rey and Fin, just as Obi-Wan did for him and his friends back in Ep 4. 

**THAT** is a hero's journey. Luke Skywalker was the very definition of what a Hero's Journey is as we see in the OT. His timeline would have made much more sense in the ST. Everything would have fit and paralleled the other movies in a better, overall arc. It's like poetry, it rhymes.

Instead what did we get? We got Luke's introduction, his argument against helping, his realization and finally his passing in ONE MOVIE.

Because of this, Leia's role is in Ep9, had it been done correctly, we as the fans and Lucasfilm would not be left without a major part of the cast now empty.

All of these things, these issues I have could have been prevented. These obvious character choices dropped or changed, all because Lucasfilm, and Kathleen Kennedy in particular, don't seem to have any sort of plan of what's going on. They're winging it, if you will. Letting each story tell it's own version of what's happening and just hoping that the ends will connect together.

There was zero reason for Holdo to exist other than to sell a book. If someone was going to make that Jump to Lightspeed attack, it should have been Leia. Now, they didn't know Carrie would pass, so I forgive them for that, but then damn it, it should have been Ackbar.

So where does this leave us? It leaves us with Episode 9 and the reasoning for my rant.

All of this is going to begin again, we're right in the same spot we were when Rian was writing TLJ during FA's filming.

JJ has to come in, fill the gap of no real antagonist because Snoke is gone. He has no Original Trilogy Player because Rian decided to end Luke in Episode 8 instead of 9 like it should have been. What we are left with is a movie about Rey vs Kylo. The Knights of Ren could make a return but they'll have minimal impact since they were dropped altogether in TLJ and haven't had any screen presence. They feel like mini bosses at best and just hurdles for the protagonists. With Snoke gone, there's no conflict between the dark and the light side of the Force anymore, any contact between Rey and Kylo will be words of how bad Kylo is, how not understanding Rey is, and their eventual saber clash.

There is no Republic, the Resistance is made up of one pilot (Poe) and four technicians. 

Yes, there were allies, none of which came to aid the Resistance and it'll feel cheap if they decide to show up now. We also have Hope, hope of the future like Broom Kid and others like him, but that's going to be a while off before any of them are ready to fight.

Rian inadvertently ended the trilogy in the second act and now JJ has to come back and try to make a third movie work.

Sorry for my rant, I had to get all of this off of my chest. I can't understand how the Marvel movies can pull this off so effectively with so many movies under their belt but Lucasfilm can't get two single movies to match up.

For the record, there was no official word that Luke should have been in 9 before his passing (if he did pass on). This is just my take on things simply because it makes more sense. 

If the trilogy was about him, the trilogy should have ended with him. The Numbered entries are about the Skywalker Saga. Luke was THE Skywalker and now he's reduced to a Force Ghost at best before the final movie.

Kylo? He's no Skywalker, not any more. He solidified his future in TLJ, he's moved on. He's doubled down on where he stands and there's no going back or redemption for him. If they do try to redeem him? Then Lucasfilm is even more lazy and idiotic than I though as that would go against everything about Kylo's character in the first two films.

So who's left?

I enjoyed both films and will be happy to add them to the collection to complete the saga and I will watch them again.

But there's this nagging thought at the back of my head that this entire trilogy could have been done so much better, so less sloppy, it had the potential of being a perfect book end to what Lucas himself created all those years ago.",StarWars,True,1517676359,2018-02-03

"[Spoilers] Just finished the Mace Windu comic, I've got some stuff to say about it.","This comic excels in two specific areas: providing a commentary on the corruption of the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars, and Mace Windu's characterization.

The story itself revolves around Mace Windu's mission to Hissrich, which serves as the backdrop for another member of Windu's squad, Master Prosset Dibs, to accuse the Jedi of hypocrisy and losing sight of their own teachings, accusations that the Council ultimately cover up.

We also get some phenomenal characterization for Windu himself, who is shown to be the most zealous of the Jedi, even as a padawan. He sees morality in very black-and-white terms, and believes that deviation from his interpretation of the Jedi way is akin to heresy. In fact, he is often paralleled with an inquisitor throughout the comic. 

Unfortunately, both of these great would-be selling points are crippled by three things: atrocious art (even by modern Star Wars comics' standards), Rissa Mano, and a dull main plot.

First and foremost among the comic's many failings is the ugly, off-model, inconsistent art. Characters' faces are often drawn without any detail, even if they are prominent in the panel, leaving every character looking like a splotch of color. Even when they *are* fully detailed, however, they are often wildly off-model, to an unacceptable degree. Then there's the complete lack of consistency, which I feel is best shown in the lightsabers. Just between panels **on a single page,** Windu's hilt constantly changes size, color, and shape.

Then, there's Rissa Mano, another member of Windu's squad. Although she is a newly-knighted Jedi, she has the snippy personality of Season 1 Ahsoka and speaks like a real-world teenager, always interjecting with some ""hilarious"" quip. Contrast with Nahdar Vebb who, despite also being a new Jedi Kinght, had a temperament and manner of speaking consistent with the Jedi we know. Personally, I think the comics' writers wanted to insert a character for the audience to identify with (as she's constantly asking questions to forward the plot), but couldn't justify sending a Padawan to Hissrich.

Speaking of the plot, it's barely worth talking about outside of how it relates to that commentary I praised the comic for. As Windu's squad comes to find, the reason the Separatists came to Hissrich in the first place was to harvest massive plants that act as an incredibly efficient energy source. This discovery prompts Master Dibs' outrage, as he believes the Council knew about the plants and sent the squad to Hissrich simply to stop the Separatists from getting it, not to protect the planet's people. After that plot point, the story may as well not exist. There's a new droid villain who, despite having some cool lines, ultimately isn't much of a roadblock. Kit Fisto is on the squad as well, but he doesn't do much other than fight droids and make the occasional joke.

In the end, the comic has some value, but not enough to warrant slogging through all of its many problems.",StarWars,True,1517688356,2018-02-03

Gripe with TLJ,"I definitely missed the boat on the great TLJ war, but I just saw it again and had a thought about it.  

After my first viewing, I was very conflicted.  On the one hand, I thought the aesthetic was great and the Luke/Rey/Kylo story line was excellent.  On the other, the Resistance plot (especially the Finn/Rose part) was abysmal on pretty much all fronts.  I have made my peace with a lot of the flaws, although I still cringed and squirmed in my seat when Rose calls Finn a ""dummy"".  I noticed an interesting comparison with Empire however. 

The middle movie in a trilogy is normally the darkest in tone.  In Empire, Han is frozen in carbonite and poor Luke gets the double whammy of his hand being chopped off and learning that Darth Vader is his father.  There is a lot for these characters, especially Luke, to grapple with on a psychological level.  Plus, the Rebellion is scattered and in dire straights.  

In TLJ, although the Resistance is extremely crippled, all of our characters are in better shape then ever.  Rey ends up shunted even further to the light side than before (I guess the title ""The Last Jedi"" is a misnomer) and is reunited with her friends.  Although Rose is hurt, Finn is chilling and laughing with the others, including Poe who gets a highly charged introduction to Rey.  Leia is hopeful for the future.  Although plot wise things are looking bad for the Resistance, our characters aren't really any worse for the wear.  

Part of what made Return of the Jedi so satisfying was watching Luke triumph over his internal conflict between the light and the dark.  I'm sort of bummed that it seems like Rey has already won that battle, and now there is a big irredeemable baddie by the name of Kylo Ren to triumph over.  I was really hoping for some interesting grey-zone force philosophizing, which the trailer for the movie seemed to promise, but that got totally thrown away instead making Rey even MORE good and Kylo even MORE bad.  Who knows what Episode IX might bring, but I hope it puts our heroes in a morally tricky situation! 

I'm interested what you guys think!

So I'm only just now getting to Empire's End and..,"... I just found the *awesome* HK-47 reference! Mister Bones:

That's an exact quote from HK-47 in KOTOR! It's so awesome that Wendig linked a canon murder-droid to a legends murder-droid! The speculative Star Wars fan in me hopes that they'll make HK-47 = 0-0-0 Matrix, by flashing back to Triple-0's past when Aphra breaks into the Tarkin Initiative Hivebase-1, making HK canon. (EDIT: Becuase Triple-0 is making Aphra steal backhis memories from the Empire; it's the perfect opportunity) And when Triple-0 is inevitably defeated, show Temmin finding the broken 0-0-0 matrix.

To those who think Disney will drop Rian Johnson's new Star Wars trilogy,"The only way I think Disney would drop Rian's trilogy is if they read the script and decide that the idea he pitched to them doesn't work.  They offered him the trilogy after seeing the product of TLJ, showing that they were very impressed with what he did with the movie, they thought his vision was well communicated, and they like the idea for the new trilogy.  Disney has never been a reactionary company.  They like directors who bring ideas that they want to show on screen.  The fact the Solo has had so many directors fired during pre to mid production tells me that they did not like the directors vision and/or ideas. They have NOT retracted a movie (in recent memory) from a director because one of the directors more recent films was subject to some fan backlash.  If Disney likes an idea and thought the movie portrayed that idea well, they are happy with the product.  All evidence points to that being the case for TLJ.  Now, if Rian hands Kathleen Kennedy the script for movie 1 from the new trilogy and she hates it... then yes, she might pull the plug.  But I really don't think fan backlash and final box office numbers for TLJ will have any bearing on whether or not they go ahead with the new trilogy.  They had to have known that TLJ would be a much more polarizing movie than TFA- and they like that!  So rest assured, the new trilogy will more than likely happen, assuming that Rian's script matches the original idea he pitched to Disney.",StarWars,True,1516646485,2018-01-22

Of course this is entirely speculation, as they still filmed Fisher in hospital robes when she shoots Poe, but maybe she was originally supposed to wake up earlier or something?? I remember thinking it was weird that Leia didn't die, and still she had comparatively very little screen time. I would imagine that some of that is intentional. ",StarWars,True,1516647187,2018-01-22

Discussion about Luke at the end of TLJ (Spoilers),"A couple of days ago at my friends and I were discussing TLJ again and the the discussion lead to Luke's force projection and we had differing opinions on why doing that lead to Luke's passing.

My friends belief is plain and simple. The act alone is what caused Luke to die, since Kylo plainly says to Rey earlier that she couldn't be projecting herself to him since, ""The effort alone would kill you"". My argument is that the fact that Luke had only just recently reopened himself to the Force and then preforming such a strenuous task is what caused his passing. Granted nothing is stated that Luke's connection with the Force was weakened after his time disconnected from it but I feel like it would be. It's my belief that a Luke Skywalker that hadn't closed himself off from the Force would have been able to pull the trick off with only minimal stress to himself. 

What are your guy's thoughts?",StarWars,True,1516648725,2018-01-22

I think Kylo will legit be a horrible dark leader. He's too conflicted. Like he wont order any mass killings and he will be way more lenient than snoke was. I know he was mad as hell after Rey rejected him and hes impulsive (skywalker duhh) so on Crait he wanted to kill everything and everyone because he was so angry.

But I highly doubt he will be like that in all of 9. Thoughts?

Do you expect a mutiny against him or something along those lines? Because i highly doubt he's just gonna get away with killing snoke just like that",StarWars,True,1516648956,2018-01-22

EP IX opening scene and finale theories,"Opening:

The opening crawl mentions that two years have passed since the Battle of Crait. General Organa recently sacrificed herself for the survival of the Resistance, and they are on Chandrila (where she lived most of her adult life and raised Ben) for her funeral.

The scene opens with First Order forces above Chandrila, at enough of a distance to remain undetected. Supreme Leader Kylo Ren orders the FO to wait until the ceremony concludes to attack the city, out of respect.

The newly-rebuilt Resistance attends Leia's funeral in Hanna City. Poe, Rey, Finn, Rose and Connix all stand together, leading us to believe that the group have been through a lot the past two years and are now very close friends. The last survivors of the Alderaan catastrophe are present to send Leia off with the final Alderaanian royal ritual. Rey places Han's dice on the coffin before it is lowered into the ground.

As the ceremony concludes, Rey feels a dark presence. She scrambles to find her new Jedi padawans. Next thing we know, Kylo leads the Knights of Ren into battle in Hanna City, and they are *all* revealed to have red lightsabers. Rey and her new Jedi (including broom kid) face off against them briefly, but something (TBD) distracts them and forces both groups to retreat.


Closing:

Rey and the New Jedi go to the old Jedi Temple on Coruscant to face off against Kylo and the Knights of Ren. Rey and Kylo discuss the Temple, dipping a bit into the lore of Star Wars dating back to the prequel era and even Old Republic era. The *most* epic battle of all of Star Wars ensues, with Rey and the six Jedi fighting Kylo and the six Knights of Ren. It is an emotional one-on-one fight between Rey and Kylo until they lock blades and realize that they have the chance to do something special, something never done before. Eventually they retract their lightsabers at the same time, effectively ending the conflict between First Order and Resistance, dark and light, Sith/KoR and Jedi, good and evil.

We see in the epilogue that the Force has been totally balanced, and the Jedi are reformed completely to use both sides of the Force - they do not commit fully to either side, instead using the Force as a balanced entity. Romantically-speaking, Rey and Ben end up together, Finn and Rose remain together, and Poe and Connix end up together.

The movie ends with Force Ghosts of Yoda, Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Anakin, Luke and perhaps even a CGI Leia (if they decide to do that for this closing scene) all looking upon the six ST main characters with pride that the saga-long conflict between light and dark is *finally* officially over.",StarWars,True,1516650175,2018-01-22
Why Aren't Clone Troopers Driven Mad By Their Own Existence?,"I've always wondered how the clone troopers were able to keep their sanity during their early childhood and training.

First off, no individuality. You're born with nothing but a number. Everyone around you has the same face and you're expected to behave identically to each other, so you have little-to-no self identity or uniqueness. And since you're a copy of someone else, you have no idea of knowing what is genuine about yourself. Are the thoughts in your own head YOUR own individual thoughts or are they your template's thoughts from HIS childhood? Are you even a person?!

Let's not forget the lack of parental care. Do you know what happens when babies can't or don't form emotional attachments with their caregivers? They grow up not knowing how to form attachments with others. This is known as attachment disorder and is SERIOUSLY dangerous for a child's mentality. Since clones are basically breed in jars, they have no parents. There's no voice soothing them during development and no face for them to latch onto at birth. You grow up without ever meeting another human aside from your ""brothers,"" so you don't know how to socialize, interact with, or connect with other humans. That's pretty dangerous for a child's development.

And finally, let's talk about the dehumanizing process. Not only are you basically a number, your only purpose is to fight and die. No questions asked, no other choice in life, no other options. You aren't taught to value your own life, only the life of your superior. Your importance as a living individual is measured on how well you can shoot a rifle. You're completely disposable and easily replaceable.

Despite all this, all the clones we see appear to function as relatively stable, well-functioning children and adults. They see their existence and purpose as completely normal.

How the holy hell do these boys not end up going psycho?!

(spoilers) I would like to talk for a bit about THAT Luke scene from TLJ,"I would like to talk about the scene where Luke goes into Ben's tent.  This is such a fascinating scene because not only is it told to us from three different perspectives, but to fully understand what is going on you have to fully understand where Luke's character was at at the time.  You get this information from his second lesson to Rey in which we get our first tent scene.

In the second lesson, Luke is talking about how the Jedi became so self absorbed that they failed to see what Sideous was doing, and even trained the man who would become Darth Vader.  He spoke of hubris and how he had begun to believe the legend he had become which led to his own failing.  He failed because he was Luke Skywalker, a legend.

The final viewing of the tent scene puts everything into place.  We had already seen Ben's version in which Luke attacks him for seemingly no reason.  The third shows Luke looking into Ben's mind in an attempt to gauge how much Snoke had poisoned him.  Here is where I think some confusion happens, because I have seen people complain that he tries to kill Ben because of the darkness within him, but that is not how I see it.

Back in the second lesson, Luke talks about how he had convinced Leia to let him train Ben.  He was the one to get the students.  It was his academy he had become proud of.  While looking into Ben's mind, he said he saw that Ben would destroy everything Luke held dear, and in that instant he reacted on pure instinct.

That makes it appear that it wasn't the darkness within Ben that caused him to turn on the lightsaber, but rather his own pride.  He saw Ben destroying his legacy and he thought he could stop it.  That is why it was such a momentary impulse, he gave into his pride and immediately regretted it.  

I think this makes Luke a very human character, as this desire to keep something you are proud of is a common issue that is part of the human condition.  This is why I really like this scene and think it is such a great way to create our villain.",StarWars,True,1516660819,2018-01-22

Why the best weapon in the Star Wars universe is a normal firearm.,"All the projectile weapons in Star Wars fire a ""blaster bolt"" not a laser. If they did fire lasers, I wouldn't be writing this. As is clearly demonstrated by the movies and TV shows, blaster bolts are incredibly slow. They move across the screen much slower than your average arrow, which is why I have no difficulty believing that a Jedi can deflect them with their lightsaber. Because swordsmen can deflect arrows with their swords. This is exactly why a normal 21st century firearm would be the ultimate weapon in the Star Wars universe. A bullet is traveling way too fast for the eye to see, let alone react to and block. Not only could a Jedi not block a bullet, but even if they did, the bullet would simply be cut in half, and they would destabilize, but still have plenty of power to go into the Jedi's body. And if that failed (which it wouldn't) you would simply whip out your 12 gauge loaded with bird shot.

Padme's Lack of Concern About Anakin's Vision of Her Dying,"So in Revenge of the Sith, Anakin has a Force vision of Padme dying in childbirth. Given that Anakin wasn't even sure if the baby survived, you'd think this would terrify Padme, especially since she was so close to her due date.

Apparently not. Padme just continues on with her Senate work and calmly reassures Anakin that it isn't going to happen. Uh Padme, are you forgetting what happened the last time Anakin had a death vision?! It totally came true! This one not only concerns you, but the life of your child and you're just handwaving it off?!

I think it would have added to the story if Padme actually did take Anakin's dream seriously and tried to prevent or find the cause of it. Have her go visit a trusted doctor/medical center and undergo an examination to see if her body is physically capable/healthy enough to deliver. Maybe even consider the possibility of getting a C-section. This way, she would actually has evidence to back up her reassurance to Anakin.

Anakin: ""I won't lose you Padme.""

The future of Star Wars movies,"Now that hyperspace tracking and hyperspace kamikaze have been introduced in TLJ, how will this play out in future movies?

- Every time there's a space battle and one ship jumps away we will question why it isn't tracked.

In Episode IX the First Order will have this technology in all their ships, it's hard to imagine how a new Rebellion can be born under these circumstances since guerrilla tactics consist of hit-and-run, so how can the rebels run anymore?

Even after this trilogy ends, the hyperspace tracking technology is already in most First Order's Star Destroyers as it was shown in TLJ, when the Raddus first jumped away the Supremacy wasn't there so they were tracked by another ship, and Finn said even if the lead ship is destroyed, another Star Destroyer would immediately start tracking.

So even if the First Order is defeated, someone, if not a lot of people, will steal the technology.

- Also every time there's a big target we will question why someone doesn't hyperspace kamikaze into it.",StarWars,True,1516666607,2018-01-22

The Terrible Strategy of the Emperor's Best Troops,"I'm not a soldier, but I call out the terrible strategy of the Emperor's ""best troops."" Their solution is to abandon their prisoners and chase after the Ewoks into the forest. 

There are just so many things wrong with this plan. 

For one, the Ewoks clearly know the land far better than the stormtroopers. They could have had traps and ambushes waiting for them. Why on Earth would the stormtroopers think rushing blindly into the forest would be the best idea? Not only does their white armor make them stick out like a sore thumb, but it apparently can't even protect them from arrows and spears.

Second, the stormtroopers didn't even cuff the rebels. The second the ambush happened, Han and the others began wrestling down stormtroopers. Rather than secure the rebels, the rest of the troops just ran off after the Ewoks, giving the rebels ample opportunity to secure weapons and fight.

Third, they left the bunker unguarded. Yeah, it's locked, but with the survival of the Death Star at hand, I don't think they could be too careful.
 
I think a better strategy would have been for the stormtroopers to hold their positions and have the AT-STs secure a permitter around the bunker, keeping the Ewoks at bay. Request a TIE bombing run on the forest. Heck, start a hostage situation and threaten to kill the rebels if the Ewoks don't surrender. ",StarWars,True,1516667859,2018-01-22

"Upon rewatching Attack of the Clones, Padawan Anakin was much wiser than Obi-Wan and the Jedi Council","After the assassination attempt on Senator Padme Amidala, Chancellor Palpatine suggests that Padme receive security from ""an old friend, like Master Kenobi."" Knowing that Palpatine is in fact the Sith Lord, this move is strictly calculated to establish a connection between Padme and Anakin where he could then manipulate Anakin's thoughts and feelings by using Padme as bait. Padme, not clouded by the dark side, sees the futility in more security rather than investigating the actual assassin. 

Cut to the condo scene where Anakin and Obi-Wan are greeted by Padme. In response to the Jedi visit, Padme claims she doesn't need more security but answers on who's trying to kill her. Anakin concurs with Padme, and in response, Obi-Wan states that they will not exceed their mandate. Anakin responds by arguing that investigation is implied in their mandate because ""protection is for local security, not Jedi."" Obi-Wan then responds that they will do ""exactly what the council has instructed.""

Anakin sees through the futility of providing the Senator with additional security and senses something is out of place. Spoiler alter: something is out of place! Palpatine assigned Obi-Wan to protect Padme so Anakin would be attached to her which will fuel his romantic attachment and fear of loss which influences his turn to the Dark Side. Anakin's reaction is the exact opposite reaction by the Jedi whose judgement is clouded by Palpatine himself. 

Anakin knows Padme doesn't need Jedi security, while the Jedi accept Palpatine's claim that she does, at face value. Anakin is only a Padawan and in his introduction we already see that he is much wiser than the Jedi Masters.

Anakin not only sees ""through the lies of the Jedi,"" but also the lies of the Sith. The Jedi just failed him by undermining his outlook, and suppressing his emotions. ",StarWars,True,1516670282,2018-01-22

Here is one that I have not seen anyone mention. It’s about Kylo and another character’s first interaction in TLJ.,"When Kylo and Rey have their first ForceTime, Kylo immediately reaches out (and in) to Rey’s mind.  He says, “You will bring Skywalker to me.”  We then see Rey react to his intrusion, and she does a little face twitch thing.  It was Like the nose scrunch she did during the interrogation in TFA.  Anyways, she seemed to do something nasty with the force.  Then we see Kylo react to it with a grimace.  It looked like he had his arm stuck in a trap.  Then, he pulls his hand back “out” ever so gently.   In those 4 seconds of interaction we learn, subtly, that Rey has built up some kind of protection.  Rey is able to resist and she even seems to harm Kylo (and quickly) that he gets nowhere and immediately withdrawals.  I really liked how Rey really didn’t even from Kylo’s reach in, she just gave him the business right back.  I thought that was neat.

I think maybe even the larger intent of that scene was to later show how easily Snoke could get it out of her, relative to Kylo’s power.

Semi related note:  The fact that Kylo (via Snoke) learned Luke’s whereabouts is what totally wrecked Luke’s End for me on my first viewing.  I saw that god damned sunspot and mistook it for a ship arriving from far in the distance. I was all set for someone to be shown arriving at Ach-To and then....nothing.  LOL

Lingering TLJ questions,"So I just rewatched TLJ with some family and even after a second viewing there are things I don't get and want to see if it didn't make sense or if I'm just missing something here.

1) Who are the knights of Ren? They seemed to be hinted in TFA but in this movie (even the explanations of the jedi temple destruction) they don't matter in the past and clearly don't exist now.

2) Why did Phasma exist at all? She was in 2 movies for a grand total of what like 5 minutes and didn't do much of anything?

3) Who the hell is Snoke? How can someone so powerful either a) not be powerful THE WHOLE TIME palpatine existed since he evidently couldn't feel him or b) what was he doing the whole time? How did he turn an apparently tiny remainder of the Empire into the massive military power of the first order? I feel like this needed at least some backstory... Its not like in the OT where the Emperor is relatively unexplained because we don't know the Empire timeline, but we KNOW at the end of ROTJ that the rebellion won etc. I just don't understand.

4) This will probably be the most controversial, why was the Leia mary poppins scene a thing? Maybe it was just how they shot it but it looked so awkward. Also if the point was to just knock her out of commission, why not just set it up where she gets knocked further *into* the ship by a blast and unconscious. Especially because tbh she doesn't do much for the plot after.

Lastly, I still don't forgive them for doing Ackbar like that. Damn.

[SPOILERS] 30 things that went through my mind when I watched The Last Jedi,"Lone fighter? Who's that? Oh, of course. BB-8.

So they are going full Empire Strikes Back by starting with a battle.

Poe is toying with Hux. These two were in Ex Machina and it didn't end well for either of them.

If this is the Asian girl who's supposed to be with Finn throughout this movie, I don't mind.

Oh shit, said Asian girl just got blown up.

Poe, you little shit.

Luke's going through a midlife crisis at the end of his life.

Porgs found the lightsaber! Porgs for the win!

Rey is so strong with the force that she just broke open Luke's tightly shut door! Hey wait, it's Chewie!

Porg, please remember, one does not simply mess with Chewie, especially if you're considerably smaller. As C3PO would say, let the wookie win.

The actual Asian girl who's with Finn throughout this movie is nowhere near as pretty.

Holdo is really tall. I guess we never realized that when she had a T-Rex next to her.

R2D2 for the win! Convincing Luke to train Rey while making all of us want to watch the original trilogy again!

Do we really need to see Rey's tits while she's wielding a lightsaber? Yes, of course we do. True feminism means a girl can be powerful and attractive without one having to diminish the other. Only sexists believe that a powerful girl should underplay her looks and an attractive girl should be dumb and powerless. So Rian Johnson is doing the right thing here. Wait, am I overthinking all of this?

Porgs are the new ewoks.

So this is how they solve the Leia situation.

Wait, they just unsolved it by turning her into Mary Poppins.

Poe goes around Holdo's back and sends a stormtrooper and a nobody on a mission to find a stranger on Maz Kanata's suggestion. What can go wrong?

Little Leia is going rogue and colluding with Poe. Does she have a thing for him?

Yes, Pai Mei is finally training Beatrix Kiddo!

Horse/bull creatures going on a rampage around a city? I've seen this in Baahubali, India's biggest movie that came out last year.

Back, Yoda is. Missed him, have I.

Wait, no Snoke in Episode 9?

Poe, you little shit (Part 2).

What a waste of Brienne of Tarth, constantly humiliated by Finn. And they said this is a girlpower movie.

Terrified porg on the Millennium Falcon, nobody asked you to get on board. There's a good reason your kind has stayed on your planet forever.

What, Poe finally understood the value of a tactical retreat? Is he becoming a good leader?

See, Luke, Rey was right all along when she said the Force is something that makes things float.

How is the Millennium Falcon still functioning?

A mature study of Rey as a Mary Sue,"Is Rey a Mary Sue seems like it has been the main question of the new trilogy. I am here to say things by definition, not opinion. 

Before I continue I must note, I am saying Rey is a Mary Sue in the movies. I do not count other source material for character development. Because no matter what she is in that source material, she is a Mary Sue in the movies. Plus, they are unknown stories to the vast majority of the audience the movie is shown to.

**Rey is indeed what people refer to as a Mary Sue in the new films. Let’s look at the definition provided by Wikipedia:**

“A Mary Sue is an idealized and seemingly perfect fictional character. Often, this character is recognized as an author insert or wish fulfillment. *They can usually perform better at tasks than should be possible given the amount of training or experience.* Sometimes, the name is reserved only for women, but more often the name is used for both genders. **A male can also be referred to as a Marty Sue or Gary Stu**, but Mary Sue is used more commonly.”

So, the stand out part here is “They can usually perform better at tasks than should be possible given the amount of training or experience.” This is absolutely true. We are given no explanation on why she is so good with the Force especially, and she also happens to be good at everything else such as hand-to-hand combat and can not only pilot ships well but knows about them mechanically.

**The second** “wish fulfillment” is a little harder to talk about since people so quickly point the finger claiming things said to be sexist, but it’s important and part of the definition. Before the new trilogy, Star Wars has been criticized for not having enough female characters, especially lead roles. Tom Hanks son comes to mind first, he complained in an article about it saying he wanted more female characters for his daughter to enjoy. Second, there is the **Bechdel test which Star Wars is famous for failing** (it’s bullshit because something like Shawshank Redemption fails but is a brilliant movie which timeless characters). Here is the official test:

“The **Bechdel test** asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added.”

So with this in mind, *Rey being female is the wish fulfillment end of a Mary Sue.* It’s no secret Star Wars has gotten criticized for lack of female characters over the years and you are naïve if you think Disney did not have this in mind when deciding on who the new Jedi should be (and of course it coincidently fits the 1973 definition of Mary Sue).

**There’s one more major similarity** Rey has with the original Mary Sue. First let’s look at another part of the Wikipedia explanation:

“Mary Sue stories—the adventures of the youngest and smartest ever person to graduate from the academy and ever get a commission at such a tender age. *Usually characterized by unprecedented skill in everything from art to zoology, including karate and arm-wrestling. This character can also be found burrowing her way into the good graces/heart/mind of one of the Big Three [Kirk, Spock, and McCoy], if not all three at once.* She saves the day by her wit and ability, and, if we are lucky, has the good grace to die at the end, being grieved by the entire ship.”

A new character to the franchise that gets into the graces of the big three. Well, in Star Wars, who are arguably the big three? Han, Leia…. and… Luke. Who Rey in fact has to meet all of them and get in their good graces (especially Han and Leia). 

**Bottom line, Rey fits this definition taken from the character that coined the phrase Mary Sue**, which is not a subjective opinion. It doesn’t matter if she is a Mary Sue or not to you, she is a Mary Sue by definition. I’ve got plenty more to say, but before this gets too long I will end it there.

**PS:** If you are tempted to call me sexiest, here are some WELL written female characters that are favorites of mine and not Mary Sues.

Beatrice Kid-O (Kill Bill series) Sara Conor (Terminator) Ellen Ripley (Alien 1 and 2) Cersi Lannister (among MANY women in GOT but she is my fav)

The budding Sequel Trilogy romance no one is talking about,"While everyone is talking about Reylo, Rey+Poe, Finn+Rose, Finn+Rey, and Finn+Poe.... has anyone stopped to consider Poe+Connix?

They worked so closely together in TLJ as Connix had an expanded role in this latest installment. There were also potential hints at their budding romance, like when she helped Poe in his mutiny of taking over the Resistance fleet from Holdo. She was also so excited to tell Poe he was right about Holdo when she engaged the hyperdrive of the Raddus, thinking she was a traitor who was running away.

They are both dedicated Resistance leaders who will no doubt have even more expanded roles within the coalition in Episode IX.

Beyond that, Connix is played by Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd. Similarly, Poe is like a son to Leia. I don't know if this is a good connection lol but I just feel like it adds to the reasoning as to why this romance should happen.",StarWars,True,1516687429,2018-01-23

Overarching Story for Sequel Trilogy,"There's been a lot said about how Lucasfilm had no plan for the sequel trilogy. These were mostly based on a lot of revelations in the press about how Rian had free reign to go in his own direction, and how Lucasfilm gave him feedback and guidance but not oversight.

First of all, I just want to say that while I love this PR line and think it lead to one of the most interesting and exciting star wars movies ever, I don't totally buy it. We've learned in the art book and other small releases elsewhere that the blueprint for the sequels was actually more influenced by Lucas's ideas than we originally thought after TFA. Only now that those ideas are out there can we talk about them openly. I believe a similar thing will happen after IX. Turns out, Lucas had ideas about a story beginning with a Rey-like non-Skywalker and an evil son of Leia and Han. Surely he had ideas about how it ended?

I think Lucasfilm is sticking to this PR line even while some fans despair over it because it reinforces the idea that the story could really go anywhere now, and no one knows what will happen next. I just think that's not likely, and as evidenced by behind-the-scenes stories we have from TFA and TLJ, I do think this team plans ahead to the extent they knew the ending of IX before they started shooting VII. Just think of the idea of Daisy and Adam's chemistry on scene. That doesnt just happen accidentally, you would test that and audition actors for that - and if you're looking for chemistry between them because the story at least needs to make you see that electricity in 8, surely there was some idea of where they would also need to go in 9?

Anyway, all that said, my real point is that for all the secret planning and agenda, I love that in the larger sense, the movies are individual to their directors and writers. People again are distraught over that, but I think we've seen lots of sequel-planning gone horribly that shows why this was the right move (the hobbit, fantastic beasts, DC movies). People point to the Marvel movies as having a grand plan but I believe that people take for granted just how much each individual director has freedom there - with Kevin Fiege there to say ""the infinity stone isnt on that planet"" but not things like ""hulk and black widow have to be in love in this one so they're ready for avengers 4"".

[Maybe spoilers] Leia's character in the ST,"I think Leia's character is one of the most disappointing aspects of the ST.

If you were a Jew in WWII, and almost everyone you'd ever known had been killed, but you fought with everything you had and eventually won, only for your own son to become the next Hilter and start the whole thing up again, how would that affect you as a person?  Multiply that by a thousand and you've got what Leia went through.

In TFA Leia is a friendly grandma in a beige jumpsuit.  She's the comforting blanket back at base.  For me she should have been Queen Leia, icy and untouchable, pragmatic to a fault, not caring about the lives lost as long as the mission succeeds, 100% focused on the task with no room for anything else. That would have fed nicely into Han's story, who couldn't stand her lack of emotion and split. It also would have mirrored Luke's troubled journey and provided real payoff when the ice finally melted and you got a glimpse of the old Leia, if only for a moment.",StarWars,True,1516705286,2018-01-23

"[TLJ Spoilers] Just watched TLJ. I feel like the main points were great, but details were quite bad.","Character development and what it means for them is exactly what I wanted after watching TFA.

Kylo is the irredeemable bad guy, the MAIN bad guy. And let's be real - he's quite badass. Got some anger issues, sure, but Snoke looked quite the force master, and he didn't see his true intentions.

Supreme leader is dead. Who cares if we don't know where he came from? He served his purpose in the story, which was tempting (successfully) Ben 10 Solo with the darkside.  But anyway, long live the supreme leader.

Kylo is also intriguing in that he doesn't want to follow the old ways, he wants to carve out the new way himself. He's also not very smart. The main bad guy in SW was always some kind of mastermind and a very powerful force user, Kylo is just really strong.

Speaking of intriguing - Rey. The child of noone, junker rats who sold her. On the island she goes to the dark parts right away, yet we see later in the story that she always chooses to help. Kinda like Luke from OT, dark side, light side, some struggle but in the end it's important that she (and earlier he) chose light. Also it's quite interesting to have 2 main opponents on roughly the same level of power.


About Luke... What did they do to him? Mark Hamill was right in saying that Luke would NEVER act like that. He dealt with those issues in OT, he wouldn't have trouble with seeing dark side in Ben as long as there was light too - he helped DARTH FUCKING VADER after all.   
I like how he joined the force, contrary to (I feel) most people. He strained himself, but in the end he chose to become one with the force - Rey mentioned that he has cut off himself from it earlier. Not sure if he would die if he just rested after straining himself, I believe he chose do that consciously.


Now, about the weak points...  Why did the empire blast base first and transports later? Why did Kylo drop the cannon so far from their base? Why didn't the rebels use the cruiser that was supposed to be destroyed anyway as FTL missile in the first place?

I don't like Finn, I don't like Poe, I don't like Rose. Gimme Rey and Kylo, their scenes were great. Poe feels forced as the best pilot in galaxy, doing ridiculous shit that shouldn't be possible. I don't like Finn, he just serves no purpose other than ""wololo, I was empire now i'm rebellion"". 

Oh, and I don't like BB-8.





Overall I liked the movie though.

In defense of old EU,"Coming late to the party, I know, but I keep reading opinions about old EU and about discarding of it and can't help thinking that lot of people have misguided views toward it. Now when we're few years after demoting EU to Legends, perhaps there's some new perspective to take here.

""There were some great stories, but EU was also full of shit"" - true, there's no denying. But it's hard to understand how this fact mandates ousting of great stories along with the shit. The life cycle of shit was such that it went progressively ignored and high-tier canon took precedence over it. Also, Disney's plans for SW seem worse in this regard, because ignoring shit will no longer be an option. You need to take it into account as long as story group stamped it with SW license.

""EU was a self-contradictory mess"" - also true, but two things need to be asserted here. First, there was a large degree of compatibility between major works of EU. This ties to my point above: good stories were remembered and shit stories were forgotten. Good stories were written by SW fans who kept an eye on other good stories, George Lucas included. Second: mess becomes a property of any long-living franchise and Disney canon won't be different. People have already pointed out that story group didn't remember Poe and Rey made acquaintance in TFA novelisation.

""Disney was right in discarding EU, now we have clear start and everything can be kept in order"" - as mentioned above, it won't work that way. About having clear start: Disney already put TFA 30 years after RotJ, which is kind of a void in EU. They could safely put up a story very similar to what they did, only that they would need to take a bit more of lore into account. Which is exactly what Lucas was doing with TCW. It's not that hard, neither does it impose so many creative restraints as some people think.",StarWars,True,1516715238,2018-01-23

"I know jack shit about SW. I'm planning to watch the movies one by one, chronologically","TL;DR questions:

1. Should I watch Episode 1? A friend of mine who has watched them all says it's too pathetic (his words; don't eat me up). I don't have it right now, should I download or just start Ep. 2?

1. In all this, where do the sequels end, and where do A Force Awakens and Rogue One come in, chronologically?

He recommends chronologically, but I still thought of taking the community's input(s) on this. If you suggest any other sequence, feel free.

The reason I ask no. 1 is that I don't have very good Internet and can't just stream any movies I have, I need to download them. The friend I talked about actually had these and gave them to me, but said that e1 is so bad that I can really skip it and it'll be good enough.

I'm kinda interested in the entire lore and the universe, so I hope your suggestions help me get the best experience. 

So, what does r/StarWars say?

Ninja E: I will most likely watch them a few months later because I do have a lot of shit going on at the moment, but I was a bit excited to, so I just asked it right now. Gives a little psuedo-feeling about watching them...

~~E: So I think I'll go release-order. I really got an amazing response from you guys, and this has got me pumped for the viewing as well. Thank you all so very much! I think I'll also post a post-viewing thread once I'm done with one/few/all of them.~~

~~So now I think I'm going: IV, V, I, II, III, VI, RO, VII, VIII. Probably I'll watch Solo as it releases! Sounds really, very cool! And the Clone Wars, apparently will come in later too.~~

In Legends a plethora of Jedi Survived. And I feel the new canon could benefit from having a few of them survive aswell. Theres tons of possibilities. 

I personally would love to see cin drallig. He was super powerful in the Game that released alongside Episode 3 and is canon through the Comics and Clone Wars. He also seems to be an important Teacher/Mentor at the Jedi Temple. If he somehow survived we could get a badass story. Obviously he has to die so Yodas „The Last Jedi you will be“ in Empire makes sense, but I still think some awesome stories could be made.

Episode time spacing comparison/thoughts,"I am one of the SW fans that didn't think that 7 or 8 lived up to the hype that they were given. Now before I get my head torn off, I think I finally realized one of the reasons why I may have disliked them. The spacing between the episodes. When I look back to the original trilogy, or even the prequels, there was a fair amount of spacing between each episode. 

Here is when each Episode takes place canonically:
1: 32 BBY

2: 22 BBY
 
3: 19 BBY

R1: 0 BBY 

4: 0 BBY- 0 ABY

5: 3 ABY

6: 4 ABY

7: 34 ABY

8: 34 ABY


An example is Episode 1 takes place 32 BBY, and Episode 2 takes place in 22 BBY. This is a 10 year gap, which leaves a lot of character growth, and untold adventures to the viewers mind. 

Notice, in the prequels, there is either a large gaps between episodes, or a large amount of stories being told (read: The Clone Wars TV show).

In the Original Trilogy, there are a few years between each episode, not as much as the prequels, but there is still enough time in between each episode to leave a fair amount to have character growth.

However, in the sequel trilogy, there is literally no gap between the episodes. The last scene of 7 is where 8 picks up. It is also presumed that 9 will happen very closely after 8 ends, (or at least that's what I have speculated). This leaves very small room for external character growth outside of the main stories. What I mean by this isn't the main stories aren't enough, but to have such a dramatic change in tone from 7 to 8 without the time for external adventures to occur leaves a lot of questions with the audience.

I'm not saying that this is the only issues that may or may not exist in the sequel trilogy, and by no means am I trying to rip them apart, I am simply being analytical about it.

TL;DR: The time between episodes in the prequel/original trilogy gives the audience more room to imagine adventures and character growth

Looking back after it was finally ended, Legends has some great fanservice stories, particularly for Luke fanboys like myself. In fact, it lends itself well to the name ""Legends"" and that moniker has grown much more on me. 

But as it stands now, I think Canon Luke in TLJ was a more interesting character from a literary sense than Legends Luke was, who (like the rest of Legends) became subject to hundreds of authors interpreting him in their own way while simultaneously being bound to returning his status quo by the end, not unlike how ongoing superhero comics are done, and in fact is not that far a cry from Superman's common character/personality challenges. Canon Luke on the other hand, had a firm decision made about him that led to a story with arguably longer-lasting impact.

And like someone else said, we still have a lot of uncovered ground to go through, between Episode 6 and Luke's exile, meaning there's still plenty of room to let Luke be a complete badass. The difference between this and Legends is that this time, we just happen to know how it all ends. Legends was just a continuing push forward with no end in sight, that could very well have ended in a similar way to Canon Luke's story. ",StarWars,True,1516732141,2018-01-23

Poe by himself is able to take on a Dreadnaught.

Seriously? That ship doesn’t have shields for close range from fighters? Or any sort of point defense? And how is it that one or two blasts from an x wings cannon can obliterate all of its surface cannons so easily?

Why not just have 10 x wings attack each star destroyer? Once the cannons and turbo lasers  are all gone they would be completely neutralized 

And then once the bomber comes in, one payload drop takes out the entire destroyer.

Rey as Prokofiev's boy,"Listening to John William's [Rey's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65As1V0vQDM) from the TFA soundtrack the other day it reminded me of Sergei Prokofiev's [Peter and the Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dSclrpaxEI).

I'm not a very musically minded person, so I tried googling to see if it's just me making stuff up, seeing a pattern where there is none.          
Turns out, I couldn't find anything on this theme in particular, but there's plenty on Prokofiev being a major influence on William's work.        

The start of Rey's theme in particular reminds me of Peter and the Wolf, with the flute and chimes evoking a youthful, innocent and maybe courageous character, which is then confronted with drama.    

But digging deeper I found that thematically the story is a really good fit as well. If you're unfamiliar with it, [here's the wiki on Peter and the Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_the_Wolf).

tl;dr: Peter is a boy that lives with his grandpa, goes out into the garden to play with his friends: a bird, a duck and grandpa's cat.    
Then the wolf appears and eats the duck.    
With a rope, a cunning mind and the help of the bird Peter catches the wolf. Hunters appear that want to shoot the wolf, but Peter insists they bring him to the zoo instead.        

There's a plethora of versions of the play, including ones with narration by David Bowie or Boris Karloff.      
Down the rabbit hole I found two versions that struck me as strongly contrasting with each other.   
[Here's the first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OftHEUSlgV0), a Disney short from 1946. In this version Peter is set from the beginning on hunting down the wolf, the hunters are portrayed as lovable oafs.    
[The second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcisCR3-OFU) (which won Best Animated Short at the oscar's 2008) on the other hand shows the hunters as bullies and Peter as freeing the wolf in the end.     

Compassion seems to be a big theme in SW in general, and especially in the character of Rey. Compassion is also something that drives Peter in Prokofiev's play, so to me it fits.",StarWars,True,1516734470,2018-01-23
"For anyone who say ""Kylo is Anakin done right""","Long read, but it's totally worth it.

As a young boy, Anakin’s whole purpose in life is to help others. He wants for others without wanting for himself. He has no concept of selfishness, because, as a slave, nothing belongs to him, except his mother. His mother, at least, is his. He has spent his whole life with nothing except her, and then, as he gains his freedom, he loses her. Fear of loss is Anakin’s hamartia, his tragic flaw. He is taken from his mother, the only thing ever truly his to have, and, as such, grips deathly tight to any small token he’s offered, terrified to lose it in the same way. Really, it would have been kinder to leave him on Tatooine.

All Greek heroes have a tragic flaw, and Anakin is no different. Like Oedipus, we watch Anakin rise, beloved by others, put up on a pedestal, proclaimed the Hero With No Fear, when all Anakin can do is fear, not for himself but for others. His selfless desire to help others grows into a selfish desire to keep them safe, not so that they might not hurt, but so that he might be spared. Anakin is more human than any other character in Star Wars, almost uncomfortably relatable in the way that no one wants to admit. But being on the pedestal has its cost. He’s told over and over that he’s the Chosen One, just like all Greek heroes, and so, like all Greek heroes, Anakin develops hubris: pride and arrogance. He is told he is powerful and Chosen, but he is constantly put down because the Council itself doesn’t know what to do with him. He cannot help but develop pride in place of humility as a coping mechanism. What better way to be acknowledged than to become the best? Failure is antagonistic to the person Anakin believes he needs to be, the person others believe that he is. And Anakin falls into the trap easily, because not one person can see that it’s foundations have been laid by the flattery that Palpatine offers the young Anakin early on. He comes to believe he deserves it, comes to thrive off of it. Because without it, Anakin has nothing. The more tightly he grips, the more slips through his fingers, just like sand. And by the time that Anakin has his own epiphany, it’s too late. Like Oedipus, who gouges out his own eyes, Anakin resigns himself to the chains of bondage to his Master and to the Darkness; he leaves the literal bonds of slavery as a child, spends the Clone Wars fighting for ideological freedom, and only ends up exchanging one existence as a slave for another in the shell of Vader.

Anakin, regardless of the existence of midichlorians and anyone’s opinion of them, exists relative to the state of the galaxy. He is not Luke, he is not the youth of western literature on a journey; that is Luke’s role. Anakin’s role is that of the demi-god of Greek and Roman origin. When Anakin rises, the galaxy rises with him, when Anakin is in turmoil, the galaxy is in turmoil, when Anakin falls, so falls the galaxy. Anakin is intrinsic to the galaxy because Anakin, like so many other mythological demi-gods is an avatar for the gods or, in the case of Star Wars, the Force. Regardless of any one person’s views on the Force (which are extremely disparate and widely varied, so we won’t broach that subject here) this fact is indisputable. Anakin, as the Chosen One, who will “bring balance to the Force” is it’s avatar. When Anakin is claimed by the Dark, the Jedi Order’s zenith is reached, the Balance is tipped, and the Order descends into darkness with Anakin, just as his return also signals theirs.

The title Return of the Jedi doesn’t just reference Luke becoming a Jedi, but Anakin’s return to the light, and with it, the ability for the Jedi Order to once more flourish. In this he is much like Beowulf, when the Geatish hero sacrifices himself to defeat the dragon at the end of the epic poem. Failure would spell ultimate destruction for Beowulf’s people and country, just as, had Anakin failed to destroy the Emperor, the Jedi and the Galaxy would truly have been wiped out. Anakin himself has to die, however, because he is what tips the scales. Once he dies and becomes one with the Force, only then is balance restored. Balance, meaning not, as it is erroneously insinuated among so many, the return of the light, but rather the dominance of neither side. Everything evens out eventually. Just as in our world nature finds a way to balance the scales, so does the Force want naturally to be equal and proportionate in its darkness and its light. Without this, without Anakin’s intense ties to the state of the galaxy, Star Wars ceases to be a myth at all. It cannot support the format without an Achilles or a Jason or a Beowulf at the helm.

Question for my fellow Phantom Menace fans,"I love The Phantom Menace. It's my favorite Star Wars movie. I like how colorful and weird and watchable it is, and I like laughing at the dumb stuff in it.

I was just wondering, for other fans of The Phantom Menace: what is your history with the movie? Do you have much nostalgia for it? Are there people out there who like the film without having any nostalgia for it, or are TPM fans exclusively people who watched the movie as a kid?

Here's my personal history with the movie: I saw it in theaters when I was 7 years old and I think I liked it, but I don't really remember. I wasn't really into Star Wars as a kid. But I definitely thought that Darth Maul, pod racing, and the droids were cool. Flash forward to age 23, (right after TFA came out) my friend and I got super drunk and decided to watch the Star Wars prequels cuz we heard they were so bad. So we sat down and watched The Phantom Menace and we were ENAMORED with it. It was so fun and cool and dumb, and of course nostalgic. I watched it again the very next day to see if it held up while sober, and it did. (I still recommend watching it drunk with friends though.) I've watched the movie sober multiple times since then.

It's hard for me to describe the appeal of the film. Imagine if the last few Harry Potter movies had been the first ones to come out, and then after they concluded the story with The Deathly Hollows, they followed it up with The Sorcerer's Stone (exactly as-is) as a prequel movie. People would have been like ""what the fuck is this kids' shit"" and would have gotten mad because it doesn't seem to have been made for original fans. But at the same time the movie is still very watchable and fun for people who are into it. That's what Phantom Menace is like for me.

Anyways, for all the other Phantom Menace fans: what is your personal history with the movie? And what do you like about it?",StarWars,True,1516740106,2018-01-23

[SPOILERS] Scientific accuracy *does* exist in Star Wars,"So there are a lot of people calling out critics of the Last Jedi for nitpicking scientific stuff to do with the space sections especially. This also happened to a certain extent with TFA. The general claim is that Star Wars has never been scientific, and it manipulates technology and physics to tell a good story. 

This is only accurate when looking at the Saga as a whole. The Star Wars universe has different rules to ours. The problem is that it has to be *internally* consistent to some extent across all 9 films, *more* consistent across each trilogy, and very consistent *within* each film. So the prequels have floating holograms and amazing tech compared to the OT. That's mostly forgivable because it helps to show how far the glorious republic has fallen. Rogue One was so close to ANH that it *had* to use the shitty graphics for the rebel plans, and across the OT the science is never changed. 

With the two Sequels however, that just isn't the case. It's established in TFA that Poe is such an amazing pilot that he can take out multiple targets per second. Yet in TLJ, the excuse given for his ability in taking out the deck cannons on the dreadnought is that 'they're too big and can't be used on small fighters'. Despite the fact that just a few hours/days ago, Poe's squad were being shot down by deck cannons on Starkiller base. That's an inconsistency between two films that run almost back-to-back.

Even worse is the complete mess of explanations used to make way for the plot in TLJ. The Raddus (rebel cruiser) has it's bridge and hanger bay destroyed by Kylo Ren and a *single* other TIE fighter. Yet it can withstand the bombardment by about 20 star destroyers and a huge flagship for hours, despite these ships having huge guns. The Dreadnought apparently has no shields at all, if that's the case why not just load up some Y-wings with a few bombs and make high speed attacks to avoid death by TIE fighter?

Very interesting wiki post on Jakku and possible Episode 9 info.,"I found this in the wiki post for Jakku...

“Eons ago, the planet Jakku was once covered with green vegetation and oceans. At some unknown point, the planet was reduced to a barren desert wasteland. However, the planet's core still had the vital spark of life essence, something which disgusted Sheev Palpatine.[12] About 1,000 standard years before the Battle of Yavin, the Plaintive Hand plateau was the site of an event that was regarded as significant by Palpatine. He believed that the site would become significant again in the future.[7]”

"What is your favorite line, or lines from each movie? Or if you don't want to do each, what are just your favorite lines from the movies in general?","

I only got into Star Wars truly, when Phantom Menace came out. I was about 14, going to the movies to see ""The Mummy"" but my friend begged me to go watch Star Wars with him instead. ""But that shit is so gay and nerdy. I don't wanna watch that"" (Back then when we said something was ""gay"" it meant lame, wasn't meant to be a slur against gay people). He finally talked me into it, and within the first 30 minutes a life long love was born. 

So here are some of my favorite lines. 

TPM: **There's always a bigger fish**. 14 year old me thought that was so deep, and that *I* was so deep because I got it. 

AotC: [FILE NOT FOUND]

Revenge of the Sith: So many good ones, IMO. But this had so much emotion that I am not ashamed to admit I cried, and still cry when I see it. ""**You were the chosen one! You were supposed to destroy the Sith. Not join them!**"" ""**You were my brother Anakin, I loved you**"" and Anakin's brutal ""**I hate you!**"". People make fun of that line, but what do they expect a man who was just cut in half, and lost everything he loved to say? ""I don't like you much right now, bucko!"" ?

A New Hope: Cliche, but alas ""**Help us Obi-Wan, you're our only hope**"". And then Obi-Wan telling Luke how his father died, but with this edit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN74bOubUug Gets me choked up every time. I'd love to see the movie edited with just that part added in. 

The Empire Strikes Back: Of course. ""**You killed my father!"" ""I am your father!**""

Return of the Jedi: Don't remember the line exactly, but this is another one that always gets me choked up ""**Let me see your face with my own eyes**"" even though he knew doing this was an absolute death sentence. Such a beautiful scene.

The Force Awakens: ""**Look how old you've become"" ""Something far worse has happened to you**"". I think that was the best villain introduction of the entire saga. And in case it wasn't clear, I am a sensitive (Read: Little bitch) sap for emotional stuff. So this one word from TFA has a huge emotional punch ""**BEN!**"" and ""**Take off that mask. You don't need it anymore"" ""What do you think you'll see if I do?"" ""The face of my son!**"" and then Chewies scream after Kylo impales Han.. that is the most heart breaking sound I have ever heard in my life. And then my favorite comedic line from the entire saga, also said by Kylo Ren ""**The droid.. stole a freighter?**""

The Last Jedi: I don't have any favorites yet. I've only seen it once and the quality wasn't all that great. I'm sure this will change in time.

Please don't set the Obi Wan movie just on Tattooine,"If you add up the amount of screentime Tattooine and Jakku (Tattooine 2) have had in all the films you could make 2 full length films.

It would just be ridiculous that every major character is linked to Tattooine in some way, in both the OT and the PT. Hell, C3PO, Anakin, Luke, Rey and Jabba all come from these places.

What are your wishes for the live action TV series?,"I'd like to know what you're wishes for the upcoming live action TV series are. Do you wish to see completly new aspects of the Star Wars universe or would you like to see something more familiar but still a bit new like Rebels and The Clone Wars?

I've been thinking about this for quiet some time now and I'd really like to see a show like ""Band of Brothers"". It could be set either in the Clone Wars or during the Empire or even in both (501st Legion I'm look at you). It could show the bond between the clones (or stormtroopers), as we've seen it sometimes in ""The Clone Wars"". The loss of brothers and the suffering due to that. It would make all these masked people more human as we would learn to see the man (or woman if it's a stormtrooper) behind the mask.

Another idea I've got would be a show like ""House of Cards"". I'd really like to see some politics return to Star Wars but it might be better to keep it small and have it just as an aspect of a TV series or movie and not as the main topic.

Snoke Theory,"I have a Snoke theory and want to see what community thinks about it:

Picture this - **Snoke is not real and never actually existed**. It was actually Kylo Ren using the same astral projection that Luke used in TLJ. This ability consumes a lot of power (as shown when Luke did it) and so that's why Kylo has appeared relatively weak in this trilogy (his abilities are depleted from generating the image of Snoke frequently). 

It turns out we've underestimated Kylo Ren all along - he's capable of very special force abilities. Luke found out about this ability, and, when in exile, trained himself up to be able to use it. Displaying this in his fight vs Kylo Ren in TLJ is kind of his 'nod' to show Kylo that he knows his game - it signals he has worked out Kylo has this power and by extension, that Snoke is/was just a diversion to achieve his objectives.

This goes some way to explaining why we know nothing of Snoke and have no prior context. Also, where Snoke was trying to connect Kylo and Rey in TLJ, if this theory is true, it would actually have been Kylo himself setting the wheels in motion to pretend they have 'bonded' - as he had chosen to kill Snoke as opposed to choosing to execute her when he easily had the option to do so.",StarWars,True,1516757406,2018-01-23

Does anyone else prefer seeing Star Wars movies in standard definition before seeing them in 3D?,"I may have mentioned this here before, but whenever a new SW movie comes out, I always take my oldest son to see it for the first viewing; however, he's nine years old and doesn't like 3D (he saw some dinosaur movie with my parents in 3D and said it gave him a headache) so we see it in standard def.

Once I've watched it with him, I always take my brother-in-law because he's developmentally delayed and doesn't drive, and he likes to see them in 3D.

So tonight I got home from taking my BIL to see TLJ in 3D, and my wife was just making conversation and asked how I liked it a second time, to which I replied that it's always better the second time.  She said, ""You always say that,"" which is true, because any SW movie is better the second time around, but also, when I see it with my kid in standard def, I'm honed in on the story and the characters; when I see it with my BIL in 3D, I know what's coming, so I get to sit back and really absorb all of the effects and spectacle of everything.  It's the perfect combination.

One of Rey's personal flaws.,"TLJ turned Rey into a mary sue for me and many others. Aside from giving into anger easily, there is very little room for personal growth in her character. However, I recently realized that there was another flaw, that wasn't so obvious, yet should have been. Arrogance. She has rarely lost at anything since leaving Jakku. Rey has bested Kylo in all but their first encounter with him barely ever able to mount an effect defense or offense against her. It would not surprise me that at that point, she believed she was virtually unstoppable. So she willingly goes to the FO thinking she can turn Kylo and even defies Snoke to the point where he finds it amusing. And this belief is shattered when he not only knocks her on the head with her own lightsaber, but forces himself into her mind as she's helpless to stop him.

One thing that bothered me about the bomber scene in TLJ. Safety anyone?,"Every big weapons system has a safety.  If you shoot an anti tank missile, it's armed by g-forces so that it won't explode until it's well away from the shooter.  Even mortars have safety fuses so it won't blow up in the tube if it misfires.

Yet they armed highly explosive bombs, while still far from their target, which bugs me.  Not in a good way like ""Rey spilled some of her green powder when stirring her instabread"".  

I can accept the open bay doors were shielded, and that the bombs fell out through the ship's internal gravity or were propelled out, or that they didn't just put them on missiles.  You can make an in-universe explanation for this.  But arming them before they were ready to drop was a basic safety hazard.  Did this bother anyone else?

A safety field (a force?) that armed them as they were leaving the bomb bay, or at least have long strings that pulled a safety once they were a certain distance away, would have prevented disaster.  Do they not have strings with safety pins in the SW universe?  I say, it's not Poe's fault, it's the bomber designer's fault!

SW fans who saw the prequels in theaters: When did you realize they sucked and how did you cope?,[deleted],StarWars,True,1516770947,2018-01-24
Here's Why: Midichlorians were a good addition to Star Wars,"In a conversation with another member, I realized that midichlorians basically fixed a plot hole dating back to Star Wars 77. 

Go back to 1977. Darth Vader, the masked villain with the power to choke people with a magical power. 

Luke Skywalker, the nobody farmboy. He meets an old Jedi named Kenobi who teaches him the ways of the force, which turn out to be vital for winning the attack on the death star.

Wait, wait, wait. If a whiny loser can learn the force, then certainly a super soldier Stormtrooper can, too? It would make sense that they should. It improves accuracy (Use the force, Luke) and the force choke could be useful in ground combat. But, despite being led by the powerful Darth Vader, nobody else gets taught the ways of the force for... reasons. A few officers dismissed the force, but Vader even showed them how powerful it was. In what world does a military not use the most effective means available (ours, but for less than a century)? The Empire even built the most powerful WMD ever seen, so they aren't afraid of being the superior military. 

Well, Luke destroys the DS with the help of the force (to everybody's knowledge due to not using the targeter). The rebels won thanks to the force. Imagine if Luke had taught all the rebels how to use this magical power that old Kenobi had taught him. Well, it was never even mentioned, because... reasons.

Well, now we know why. Some people just aren't force sensitive due to having a lower midichlorian count. Some people are lucky enough to be born with a high midi-count and some aren't. Also, force-sensitivity always had a genetic component. Out of everybody in the OT, almost half of Force-sensitives are Skywalkers.

Midichlorians were damage control that explained why some people could learn the ways of the force and some couldn't. I don't see any negatives that midichlorians brought at all. They were even thematically relevant to TPM (symbiosis). ",StarWars,True,1516770979,2018-01-24

My ideal beginning for the Obi-wan movie would be flashbacks,"The movie would open with quick cuts of the Obi-wan vs Anakin battle. Maybe even add extra little moments since both the actors havent aged much since Rots. Maybe cutting to Obi-wan waking up from a dream, or daydream.

This would act as one of the strongest connections to the prequels we've had in a Disney era starwars movie. Also setting an emotional tone to the story of a broken but determined Obi-wan. I guess a director may not want to include footage from another movie. If i was Obi-wan though, thoughts of that battle would be in my mind daily.",StarWars,True,1516771724,2018-01-24

I hope that some missing piece of information is been withheld until IX that will make more sense of Lukes thought process, but I'll be damned if I can figure out what could be dramatic enough to make VIII look okay in hindsight. Perhaps Luke had a life outside of the force and the academy, maybe he had a go been a dad and thought Ben would kill them. I don't see Luke thinking about murder over something much less serious than that. ",StarWars,True,1516775422,2018-01-24

[SPOILERS] My girlfriend has never seen Star Wars and she started with Episode 8. She went back and watched Episode 4 with me and we had an interesting argument...,"I made her explain to me what happened in the movie. She's ESL (English Second Language) and not familiar at all with Star Wars, so it's entertaining to hear her describe the movie (the annoying shiny robot, the bear, dark Vader, the queen) and I also want to see if she didn't understand anything so I can explain it. 

When she was describing Darth Vader and Obi Wans fight, she described it as:

""Obi Wan was tricking Darth Vader so his friends could escape.""

I asked, ""how was he tricking him?""

And she said, ""he was Force projecting like Luke did and disappeared when his friends were getting away. I think Luke is going to see him now"" 

Huh. Of course I told her no, he really died. And then she said no, his body was nowhere to be found, he was just a projection. And I said yes but do you remember Luke at the end of 8 and how he disappeared? They just became one with the Force. She disagreed and said yes, because Luke was actively dying and then became one with the Force, but with Obi Wan, there was no death, just a disappearance. 

We're watching episode 5 this weekend (she somehow still has NO idea that 1) Luke and Leia are related and 2) That Darth Vader is Luke's father, so this should be fun) and she'll see that Obi Wan is actually dead. But I thought it was interesting how her natural instinct was Force projection, and how watching episode 8 first shaped her perspective. ",StarWars,True,1516781230,2018-01-24

Many of the complaints about TLJ are the same as were said about The Empire Strikes Back at the time. Patience. Let's see what J.J. can do with it.,"I'm almost 50. I've seen every movie in the theaters. I was admittedly a preteen when I saw ESB, but I distinctly remember a lot of the reaction to it. Hell, I remember my feelings weren't all that positive either. It was dark. It didn't end well. It had some weird comedic moments. It didn't follow what people believe was the ""proper"" Star Wars script. It ""subverted my expectations"". Plot holes, positioning, dialogue, etc. 

But here's the weird thing. ROTJ came out and, to some extent, *saved* Empire. I don't think that as many people would be claiming that ESB was such a great film without ROTJ doing what it did. Only *after* ROTJ did people look back at ESB and decide for sure that it was a fantastic film and that  Irvin Kershner rocked it. 

I'm not saying that ESB was panned, but that its worth as an individual film was increased greatly by the denouement(s) given us by ROTJ. I know it's the thing to complain loudly for internet points, but, having lived through the OT as a kid who loved Star Wars more than anyone he knew, I say, let's give it a chance. Let's see what JJ can do with what he was given. I'm glad he's being pushed to stretch beyond what he did in TFA. I'm betting he appreciates the challenge and will rise to it.

Was there ever an edition of A New Hope released that had Luke do two Death Star trench runs?,"I can swear that when I was a kid, Luke used to do two trench runs in Episode IV. The first one he uses his targeting computer and fails. The second is the one we all know where Obiwan tells him to use the force. 

My memory was jogged by watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFMyMxMYDNk) YouTube video about the editing of the movie. At one point, Lucas wanted Luke to do two runs, as I’ve described. When I watched that it hit me that I have a very vivid memory of watching a “two-runs” cut when I was young. And even up until a couple of years ago, when I rewatched everything in anticipation of Episode VII, I still thought he DID do two runs. But the re-watch convinced me I must have imagined that. But now thanks to this YouTube video I’m convinced again that what I remember as a kid was true! 

So was a “two-run” edition ever released, sometime in the 90’s? Or am I going crazy and my memory is lying to me?",StarWars,True,1515785651,2018-01-12
Sequel Trilogy Plot Threads,"Something people forget about when these movies are being made is that there is not truly an overall plot/storyline that was written out before the creation of the Sequel Trilogy, so the directors are in this awkward middle of having to create solid entries while also having plot threads that the next director might or might not continue. 

Examples: 

* JJ and Kasdan wrote TFA with a Rey/Kylo connection in mind. It’s there, and he even confirms in interviews. Rian chose to continue this thread

* JJ created an emperor like character shrouded by mystery. Rian chose to discard this thread in favor of strengthening Kylo’s character.

* JJ left Luke Skywalker on an island away from the galaxy for unknown reasons (minus to ‘find the last jedi temple’) and had him not say a WORD to elaborate. Rian gave him a reason and cemented Luks’s character for the whole film.

* JJ left the parentage of Rey ambiguous, leaving intrigue of the question in the force vision, BUT also has Maz tell her to forget them. Giving Rian the choice to make them somebody, or nobodies. He chose nobodies.

And don’t think Rian didn’t do the same with The Last Jedi! 

**The future of Kylo’s character.** Yes we saw a lot of sympathy for him in the movie, but Rey does quite literally ‘close the door’ on him. It’s up to JJ to choose which direction to go with it.

**Rey and the Jedi books.** Rian gave Rey the books so the the next director has more options on where to take her character and the Jedi Order itself.

**The Resistance.** With the resistance just limited to who’s in the falcon, will we start IX with a grown rebellion or still this splintered group?

To confirm all this in an Rian Johnson interview he said he was allowed to write the script as a ‘blank slate’, meaning he could’ve gone anywhere with this story.

And THAT is how this sequel trilogy is being made. Imagine if we had three completely different directors handle this trilogy, or even if somebody different than Rian took on episode VIII. The Rey/Kylo connection could’ve been thrown out, Luke could’ve been ENTIRELY different and not a broken jedi master, we could’ve gotten a 30 minute long Snoke rise to power flashback. (Lord..)

Luckily JJ has said that he likes the choices made in Rians script, and when Colin Trevorrow left the third movie JJ wasnt thrown into episode 9, he was asked. He could’ve said no, but the fact that he liked Rians script and said YES to the offer after that fact, tells me he knows how to end the story in a satisfying way given his original plot threads and the plot threads built up by Rian.",StarWars,True,1515785688,2018-01-12
What is Your Favorite Scene from Each Movie?,"**TPM -** Duel of the Fates. Specifically, I love all the stuff from the energy walls first appearing through Obi-Wan's assault on Maul after they come down.

**AotC -** Anakin at the Tusken Camp. I love Hayden's acting when he finds Shimi and the utter fury both on his face and in the music when she dies and he kills the Tuskens. 

**RotS -** The Order 66 montage. John Williams' sorrowful music fits so well and there are so many great cuts and shots all building up to Yoda feeling the deaths of so many Jedi across the galaxy. Heartbreaking.  

**RO -** I love Jyn and Cassian's death scene but the following Vader hallway massacre takes the cake. Still remember everyone in the theater losing their minds when I watched it for the first time. 

**ANH -** The Death Star trench run. Cliche but nothing beats the thrill of watching Luke believe in the Force and seeing the Death Star explode. 

**ESB -** The Vader vs. Luke duel. Great lighting, there's palpable tension in the fight, and it builds to one of the greatest twists in film history. 

**RotJ -** The whole sequence in the Emperor's throne room is my favorite. If I had to choose one part it would be the final scene from Vader threatening Leia to the Emperor's death.

**TFA -** Kylo and Han on the bridge. Amazing acting by both of them, great lighting, and strong music. I could see it coming from a mile away but it still got to me in the feels the first time.   

**TLJ -** Rey and Kylo in Snoke's throne room. Everything building up to Kylo's betrayal is great and the fight against the guards is one of the most badass in the whole saga.     ",StarWars,True,1515786235,2018-01-12
Can we talk about...,"Finn. 

Holy crap I had written him off while he was flying into the battering ram. It was so perfect if that’s how they were going to defeat the First Order. Giving his life to stop something he once gave his life to advance. ITS POETRY. But then Rose saved him....which is nice and all but he was already dead in my books. Him not dying left it open for Luke’s badassness though.

Just imagine if Finn died and Rey found out and she landed the Falcon and got out to fight Kylo with Luke....Leia got on the Falcon to fly away with Chewie and Hux shot it down. Rey would be fighting in anger, Kylo would be fighting Luke but he would want to kill Hux. THE SWITCH.

Episode IX plot thoughts.,"One of lukes main arcs throughout all of episode 8 was balance and the balance of the force. To that point what are peoples thoughts on the idea of of Rey and Ren joining together not as both dark jedi or both as light jedi. 

As 2 sides of a coin called the force. Keeping and enforcing the balance of the force. A modified rule of 2, because as much as the jedi were the ""good"" guys there was no balance when they were at the height of their power, and in fact order 66 created that balance. With 2 members of each religion remaining at the end. Rey mentions seeing ""balance"" in Kylo's future what  if he remaining a dark jedi is a necessary evil to keep that balance.

The Last Jedi Confirms the best Star Wars Fan Theory (Spoilers),"The Ending scene of the Last Jedi confirms the Bigger Luke Theory (http://biggerluke.wikidot.com/bigger-luke). Essentially the theory states that 
&gt;Bigger Luke, commonly abbreviated to BL, or more uncommonly BgL, is the slightly larger manifestation of Luke Skywalker that is said to appear in certain scenes of the original Star Wars Trilogy, contrasting to Regular Luke.
and that 
&gt;The Canon Luke Hypothesis, sometimes simply The Bigger Luke Hypothesis, in which it is theorized that within the Star Wars universe and canon there does indeed exist a version of Luke Skywalker that is slightly larger than a posited regular Luke Skywalker, or Luke Prime.

However, the most popular example is that Luke was force cloned
&gt;Perhaps Obi-Wan created an illusionary slightly larger Luke in A New Hope in order to potentially frighten imperial stormtroopers? Perhaps he has always been doing this? Perhaps Obi-Wan has been remotely replacing Luke with a slightly larger doppelgänger periodically throughout his life in order to deter would-be Imperial entanglements. Supporters argue this would explain Obi-Wan's decision to give Luke to Owen and Beru Lars on Tatooine, as it has been criticized in recent years due to the revelation that Tatooine is in fact Darth Vader's home planet. Keeping Luke on Tatooine would allow Obi-Wan to periodically resize Luke, as it can be assumed that The Force has a limited range, even for a well-trained Jedi like Obi-Wan.

&gt;Detractors argue that Imperial Stormtroopers would not be phased - let alone notice - a slightly larger Luke, and if that was the case why not keep Luke slightly larger at all times? It has also been argued that Obi-Wan is not limited to Tatooine, and could have gone to any planet he had decided to hide Luke.

&gt;Supporters argue that the sophisticated targeting computers likely present in Stormtrooper helmets would in fact be able to distinguish slight height fluctuations in Luke.

However, as we know due to the Last Jedi it is now possible to create a force clone of yourself (or perhaps another individual), and therefore if you could change appearance (like Luke did), you could easily change heights. Therefore, we can conclude that not only did Obi Won do this to Luke in the Original Trilogy, but that Yoda also taught Luke this power at the end of the Last Jedi.

Further evidence is seen in Kylo Ren's reaction to the situation. One might assume that Kylo's irrational reaction to Luke could have been because he was taller than previously believed. This may not seem like much, but it could easily have a subconscious effect on Kylo, leading to the unnecessary gunfire at Luke. Furthermore, Luke calls Kylo a kid, an insult that wouldn't make much sense since Kylo is not really a kid any more, and is normally much taller than Luke (kylo's 6'3"" to Lukes 5'9""). But this would not be the case if Luke made a bigger version of himself.

I would attempt to analyze pictures, but there seem to be a lack of good quality images of their fight. However, I am certain that this scene would be able to show how this Luke would be slightly larger than normal Luke as much detail was already given to the scene considering the footstep effect and what not.

This includes people constantly pointing to Rotten Tomatoes scores, Cinemascores, out of context interview quotes, in context interview quotes, Youtube videos bashing the film, Youtube videos praising the film, comparisons with other Star Wars films, ect. ect.

But the one thing that I saw that I really honestly disagree with is the ""DISNEY IS RUINING STAR WARS"" videos and articles. Because I really don't think anything is ""ruined"" in Star Wars or really any other franchise film series. 

For example, I am a huge Godzilla fan. I've loved those movies for as long as I can remember and watched them over and over again growing up. Obviously, the 1998 Tri Star Godzilla film (the one with Ferris Buller if you don't know) was definitely a major let down and not a very good film (IMO) at all. All of the trademarks of Godzilla or a Godzilla film were missing in what was ultimately just a popcorn monster movie. Did Tri Star ""ruin"" Godzilla? Were over 20 Godzilla films that came before it now ""ruined"" because of one bad movie? In this viewers eyes, no. It just wasn't handled well. Heck if people were so rabid about Godzilla as people are about Star Wars, they would have said Godzilla was ruined from the first few bad Godzilla films that came out in the 70's (and I'm not blind to their quality even though I do have a fondness for their cheesiness). And ultimately, after the 98 Godzilla, Toho came back and continued their Godzilla for a new crop of films, many that rank amongst the best. And 2014's Godzilla was a big hit for Legendary. I wasn't huge on that one either, but by then, I learned that, Godzilla films will be fine, because, especially evident in them, the franchise evolved and adapted to the point that one lesser Godzilla movie won't ruin what came before or after for me. 

Going back to Star Wars, the divide over TLJ is a hot topic for many, along with the film itself. And if you didn't;t like the film for legitimate reasons, I can see why and accept it. But the notion that Disney is ruining a 40 year old franchise just doesn't sit well to me. Over its history we saw an initial mixed response to Empire Strikes Back that [put off many](https://io9.gizmodo.com/heres-how-fans-reacted-to-the-empire-strikes-back-in-19-1821551259), The Prequel films making fans feel that George Lucas himself was ""ruining Star Wars"", and The Force Awakens being criticized as a rehash (which I don't honestly agree with). Now here we are with The Last Jedi and yet again we have a huge debate. But a franchise isn't ever really ruined because they'll always keep going and have a fresh slate each time a new director takes a swing and crafting something in these universes. 

Many (not everyone) thought the prequel trilogy killed Star Wars, but The Force Awakens went on to become one of the highest grossing films of all time. Planet of the Apes was perceived to be ruined by Tim Burton before Rise of the Planet of the Apes came in one blew everyones expectations, giving way for what's considered a great sci-fi fi trilogy. Batman and Robin was considered one of the worst comic book films ever made, but then Nolan brought him back with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Everyone thinks that Doctor Who being female is going to ""ruin"" Doctor Who without realizing the caliber of actress the franchise was just given.

While I wasn't a fan of the prequel trilogy, surprisingly enough, after much time they gained a following. The Empire Strikes back eventually went on to be called one of the greatest films ever made, and The Force Awakens is being praised for introducing one of the most compelling villains in Star Wars history in Kylo Ren while also giving us our first female Jedi protagonist in Rey. 

I'm not saying you have to like any of the new Star Wars films we just got, whether you are loyal to the original EU (I wasn't in that world) or you just didn't like the film as a whole, but just because these films might not have hit the mark for many, it doesn't mean that the films following can't. Lucasfilm has a very close knit story group aimed to give fans the best stories they possibly can, and we have directors and writers who all are up loving this franchise who want nothing more than to make a great film in this universe. And if you loved the films, thats awesome as well! Don't be afraid to show your love for them. But also don't be too concerned over online film ratings. 

Disney isn't ruining it. They really can't. They might make some things you don't like, but it doesn't destroy a 40 year old saga. It'll always adapt. It'll always evolve. Or it might just end at the right time. For me as a fan brought back in my these new films, I am so happy to be able to share these new films with my younger sister and newly born nephew. Star Wars will be fine. It will always be fine. It has survived decades of fan love, fan hate, questionable choices to amazing choices. 

Hopefully that all made some sort of sense. Not trying to annoy anyone. May the Force be with you all :).

Luke is super relatable in The Last Jedi and why I love his arc.,"When I was a kid, Luke was my favorite. Not because he was the hero of Star Wars or the one who blows up the Death Star or takes down an AT-AT with a lightsaber but because he was just a kid from a boring home who wanted an exciting life. He wasn’t super cool like Han Solo or had a huge prophetic destiny like Anakin Skywalker — Luke just wanted to escape a dull life, found a way out and ended up finding meaning. In a similiar fashion, I was a boring suburban shy kid who just wanted to escape. I eventually found more exciting adventures by moving to the city and then finding more with a love of traveling the world and eventually moving to another country.


Now Luke returned in The Last Jedi and a lot of people were disappointed. I can’t speak for them but I definitely was not disappointed. In the 30 years since return of the Jedi, he became a legend and did many great feats (which we will probably learn more about as that era eventually gets told). As a fan I loved that, but seeing Luke lose faith and make mistakes is what made him relatable to me as an adult. We all make mistakes that we thought we would never do and Luke did mistakes that even caused Mark Hamill to say that it wasn’t “his Luke Skywalker”. But why couldn’t Luke be a guy who made huge mistakes? Do something out-of-character? It’s human.


I have done things I regret over the past few years and at some points did not know who I was. But seeing Yoda return to teach Luke one last lesson about the ""greatest teacher being failure,” choked me up while watching and made me realize that anyone can make up for failures of the past. 


And seeing Luke take on the First Order in the most epic way possible proves it. I know some complained that it felt weaker because he wasn’t actually there but not for me. It just showed that he was the most powerful Jedi of them all to perform such a feat — as far as we know, no Jedi has ever done such feat from across light years. And he saved the remaining Resistance members in the MOST Jedi way possible — to paraphrase Yoda — by using the the Force with knowledge and defense, not for attack.

"I’m sorry, I’m just going to say it. Daisy Ridley is not a good actress.","She’s certainly not cut out for being the lead character in one of the biggest movie franchises ever. I mean really, pay attention to her next time you watch TFA or TLJ. She is either more wooden than Hayden Christensen, or completely overacts. Case and point, just listen to her delivery when speaking to Luke on Ach Tu early on in TLJ. She sounds like a middle schooler being called on to read from their literature book! Or, what about in TFA when BB-8 tells her Finn stole Poe’s jacket. She goes from 0 - 10 in seconds! I’m sorry, but she’s just not the right fit for the lead role.

"[SPOILER]Finally saw TLJ! One thing I actually liked, and then one question.","[spoilers] /s (""I think it's neat how if you think about it both Kylo Ren and Luke wanted the same thing. They both want the past to die. They both make comments on letting things go and they both want the Jedi to end. I think it's a cool reminder that just because two people ultimately want the same thing it doesn't mean they are the same. In other words how you get somewhere is just as important as where you're going.)

My question is about the code breaker. Why did the First Order even make a deal with him? It seemed so stupid and pointless to me. There has got to be something I'm missing. They didn't know the rebels plan ahead of time so they couldn't have had him in the jail cell on purpose. The next time they have any contact with him is when they catch the rebels on their ship. At that point they have captured the rebels including the code breaker. Why would they say ""Oh you're cool bro, here take this ship and cash and be on your merry way"". I mean at that point he had nothing to offer the First Order. Just seemed like a shoe in ""Got to have at least one betrayal moment"" in the movie.)

Darth Vader on the other hand might have felt a certain proud when seeing how Kylo did what he was never able to do. Killing his master, and ruling the Galaxy. He might however be disappointed by Kylo's constant struggle with the light.",StarWars,True,1515800191,2018-01-12

I think the resistance is the worst part of the Sequel Trilogy,"I don't really have a problem with the First Order. It makes sense that there's a sizable empire faction left. I could have done without the Starkiller death star 3.0 since that plot is completely repetitive and redundant at this point. 

The New Republic should have been the main characters. It would have been a fresh change from the status quo of underdog rebels vs the empire with no jedi, death stars, and deformed evil emperors bitching about ""young fools"" Destroying the New Republic felt like a complete asspull to me. 

Now that's there's like a hundred survivors of the resistance, it just feels pointless. Forget how they're going to stop Kylo Ren, how are they going to set up a stable galactic government? Who would be okay with that after trillions of people died making the first one?

I had a friend who had 400 people join his lacross club. I don't expect those guys to take over the school, let alone the town, let alone the country, let alone set up a stable galactic government.",StarWars,True,1515802988,2018-01-12
Just got back from seeing The Last Jedi for the second time,"Boy do I love this film! As of now it's probably my third favourite Star Wars film. It has so many iconic moments where I was just in awe, even on second viewing.


Seeing it again also allowed me to revisit some of my prior criticisms:

The first time at some moments I didn't really like the humor in the film, but on second viewing the jokes felt way less intrusive to the story and I wouldn't be able to understand how those jokes could ruin the movie for someone.

The Canto Bight sequence, while not exceptionally well done, felt a lot less out of place and I actually enjoyed it a lot more than on my first viewing.

The overall pacing of the movie also felt a lot more natural to me. Which I think is because when I saw it for the first time there was so much to process, and the second time I wasn't obsessively following every story beat.

And this movie has some seriously emotional scenes, a few moments I had tears in my eyes, even the second time.


The first time I saw it I already really liked it, but now I can gladly say I really love this film and I'd recommend everyone to see it a second time, as you'll have had time to process and comprehend this fully packed 2 and a half hour movie.

What did you guys think after seeing the movie a second time and how did it (positively or negatively) influence your opinion of the film.",StarWars,True,1515804597,2018-01-12
What's the meaning behind *that* scene in TLJ?,"I've watched The Last Jedi for the third time one of these days and usually when I watch something more than twice I get to understand or notice many things I wouldn't in the first sight. However I still fail to get my mind around that scene when multiple Reys stand in line like a bunch of dominoes and when she's having all those visions in the dark cave, I just can't understand the meaning of multiple Reys in a queue formation.

[SPOILERS] The Last Jedi 2nd viewing,"Things I noticed

The humour was less prominent I had enjoyed a few of the jokes the first time around but knew them already and as it faded into the background the desperation of the Resistance and tension increased

It was less Rosey and Canto Bighty - maybe I have become de-sensitised - this was my least favourite part but i think this was because it was aimed at younger viewers not me

The battle scenes were visual stunning - they really shone through

I had read many fans posts citing plot holes or unscientific events but it is a work
of fiction and there were hugely compelling counter arguments in this subreddit citing evidence from the OT, Star Wars EU and from the TLJ visual dictionary so I just forgot all of this and took everything at face value this time - in general I watched this movie with my heart not my head this time and thought about it after the viewing

I enjoyed all the parallels with OT and the new ideas that TLJ introduced especially the new Force powers - I completely missed Kylo getting rainwater on him when Force connecting to Rey - wow

I liked that there was a master codebreaker but they could only find A codebreaker - the life lesson - work with what you have - that said the master codebreaker may not have sold them out 

Leia has no luck - tough gig - mother died in childbirth killed by her father, hunted by her father then her son, abandoned by Han and Luke - its heartbreaking - also she’s the last of the senior leadership of the Resistance who are killed one by one to keep her and the rest alive - the hopelessness is palpable

The characterisation of Snoke was excellent Snoke’s dialogue was impeccable weirdly fans might have found themselves more invested in what Rian delivered with Snoke in TLJ than in TFA but then in some Van Gogh like mad genius cutting off his own ear Snoke is killed in favour of advancing Kylo’s story which I think was appropriate but disorientating as some work had clearly gone into Snokes portrayal and I can see that fans got invested 

Luke is like a space hippy/eco-warrior, dropping out of society/the struggle, living off the land and then using a Gandhi like force projection to disrupt the First Order in a non-violent inspirational protest - I enjoyed all over again the bit when Luke drags his foot across the salt sand of Crait leaving no mark

So, I looked online to try and find out why so many people hated it, the problem was that everyone who hated was simply ranting and raging about and not being particularly respectful to anyone else, so that it was impossible to get a clear image of exactly why people disliked some parts of it.

So, my question is for those of you who disliked tlj to explain in a civil manner why you disliked it in detail whilst being respectful and not ranting . Eg. I hear that (whilst I thought it was brilliant) the discovery of Rey's parentage really annoyed many fans and just wanted it explained to me.

The new movies are trying too much to replicate the OT while they should aim to be like the Prequels.,"Yes the OT is better than the Prequels but not for reasons such as overall ambiance or even plot.

The prequels had by far the most interesting setting and powerful ambiance, the Jedi council,Coruscant,Jedis going on mission, it made you feel things were at stakes, the world was gigantic, there were forces, wiser and more powerful than our protagonist handling things

Were they bad executed? Yes but it doesn't take away that it was far more compelling than cliché evil empire vs good rebels, if not for execution (poor acting,cringy dialogues and so on) the Prequels would outclass the OT for It's originality alone.

Why is the Jedi Order so hell-bent on repressing emotions rather than dealing with them?,"As we saw with Anakin, telling a jedi ""No sexy time, no sharing your feelings, no nothing"" only causes them to resent the council for artificially restricting natural human emotions.

And we know that the human people in Star Wars are at least close in biology to us because they feel exactly what we do, the only difference is that those in tune with the Force have to deal with their emotions somehow in a special magical way, Sith by feeding their desires until the bitter end, and Jedi supressing their desires until they take them to the grave or use it to bring others to their graves.

That's... not healthy. This is a real philosophy that happens in real IRL all the time. You ever hear the phrase ""Conceal don't feel"", where you bottle up every concern until you have a heart attack or strangle whoever's in your immediate vicinity? It looks like that's what the Jedi tried to do and Anakin called them out on it, after which the whole order basically became... not orderly.

Why do Jedi repress desires instead of channeling them carefully?

#""Because feeding emotions is what turns you into a Sith, of course""

I suppose, but it would also appear that pretending they don't exist can *also* turn someone into a Sith - not just a Sith, but a Sith with a bitter resentment toward his previous masters - a Sith made more dangerous by how vengeful he is.

Shouldn't the Jedi Order, have, like, considered something like Anakin's situation could happen?

Maybe the Jedi could've been the promiscuous, lusty side of humanity that chases positive emotions like compassion and love instead of the faction that pretends there aren't such things as emotions. Maybe they could've gotten their sexy Sith desires out in the form of rough, unfettered sex so they could return to being responsible peacekeepers later, like a police in the streets, blacksaber in the sheets kind of a situation there.

Emotional repression doesn't work anywhere, the key is to figure out how to deal with them, not ignore them. You'd think the Jedi Council would've figured this out by now with all their elders full of wisdom and experience who have probably seen Jedi turn to the dark side because they had to hide their little crushes on each other.

The only remedy to this I can think of is allowing the Jedi to jack off to get SOME kind of emotional release, but furious fapping doesn't sound Jedi-like.

Noticed some deep symbolism in the green milk scene,"So everyone's meming about the scene in TLJ where Luke milks a space-walrus for some green milk and drinks it, when I remembered how this was similar to how Luke drank blue milk in ANH. Then I thought about the colors of the milk, and how they're significant to his character.

In ANH, the milk is blue, just like the color of his first lightsaber. But in TLJ, the milk is green, just like his second lightsaber. And the parallels don't stop there: 

In ANH, Luke doesn't get his own blue milk. Aunt Beru gets it for him, just like how Luke's blue lightsaber wasn't originally his, and how it was given to him by Obi-Wan. But in TLJ, Luke gets his green milk all by himself, just like how he created his green lightsaber all by himself.

Basically, Luke's transition from blue milk to green milk symbolizes his growth from a child to an adult. When he drank blue milk, he was childish, and depended on others to help him. But by the time he gets to green milk, he's matured as a person, and can live all by himself without others helping him.

People are giving Rian Johnson a lot of shit right now, but I really appreciate how he inserted that subtle nod to the original movies in the new film. When Luke took a swig of green milk from his bottle, it really reminds me of how far he's come in the galaxy. He went from a moisture-farming kid in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, to a walrus-milking hermit in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. Absolute poetry.",StarWars,True,1515817542,2018-01-12
(Spoilers) I am just now realizing the position the Resistance is in.,"Huge Spoiler Alert!!!





So I am just now thinking about how desperate things are for the Resistance. Since the Rebels/Resistance there has never been this few people and this little resources. The Rebels always had powerful friends in the Senate and on major worlds. While I am sure there are people out there that would help, the Resistance receives zero help from anyone when they need it most(other than Rey and Luke who is now dead btw). They have no base, maybe 30 people, no starfighters, no capital ships, just literally the Millennium Falcon (which could take on the First Order by itself if it had to, dont deny it!). Oh and in case you forgot the New Republic was completely wiped out so the galaxy seemingly is either controlled by the First Order or completely on their own.

This is as dark as it has ever been in any of the movies and I am saying this as someone who critiqued this movie way more than I probably should have. (I am saying this because this thought process is making me like it a lot more)

I wish this would have been the first movie in this series. They have so much to try and explain in one movie. It will be interesting to see how the Resistance recovers, get money, sets up a base, recruits, builds ships, well everything.

"[SPOILER] Comparison between Twin Peaks and TLJ regarding the ""flow"" of a series","I think a lot of people who were less than satisfied with TLJ have been describing their issues (in simple terms) as the movie not ""feeling"" like a Star Wars movie, even if it is very well made (from a filmmaking stand point). At least, that tends to be my feelings on the movie, despite having a general positive view of it.

I was talking about this with a friend of mine who loved the movie but isn't really much of a Star Wars fan, and he drew a parallel to the television show Twin Peaks. I haven't seen much of the show, but based on what he described a lot of fans are disappointed because the newest season doesn't ""feel"" like the old one, and the creator, David Lynch, said that was very much intentional. Twenty years have passed since the show last aired, so the creator felt that it couldn't and shouldn't be the same. Fans shouldn't expect things to stay the same, again because of the huge gap in time. 

There's valid arguments on both sides for whether or not Star Wars should change, but we came to an interesting thought: would fans who were disappointed with the vibe of TLJ have different (potentially more positive) opinions had TFA had the same vibe?

Do people feel like they were ""sold"" the idea of the sequel trilogy being the same atmosphere and feeling of the OT or even the PT because of TFA, only for that to be pulled from them when TLJ came out? Will TLJ feel like a black sheep movie in the saga if Ep. IX returns to the type of atmosphere present in TFA (of which it assumably will, at least to a degree given the return of JJ)? 

Furthermore, how much tonal consistency do the movies within each trilogy need to have? On this subreddit we tend to describe things in terms of the OT or the PT, or even Rebels and Clone Wars, but will we be able to describe things in terms of the ST? Will it feel jarring to watch one after another? Does this matter?

Just watched Star Wars for the first time...,"I am a 24 yo female who is new to reddit BUT I just completed the Star Wars series after watching for the first time.....and holy SHIT. Anyways, just wanted to throw out some opinions and see the general reactions. First, my favorite characters are Vader, Darth Maul (why the f^*k was he only in one movie????), &amp; Anakin. Least favorite......pretty sure we can all agree its Jar Jar. Favorite movies? Empire strikes back &amp; Revenge of the Sith. Personally thought Revenge of the Jedi was the worst.....that horrible cgi editing by George Lucas??? the ending??? the reveal of Leia &amp; Luke being siblings &amp; George Lucas claiming he was going to do that all along?? Idk....Star Wars plots seem to lack depth sometimes, as well as character development. Rogue One was okay, kinda boring-maybe my appreciation would increase if I were to rewatch it. Really the only good scene was Vader being a total badass at the end. The last Jedi was fine.....not a great movie, in my opinion. Seemed very commercial in its desired audience. Although it was nice to see Luke redeem himself and not be a little bitch for once. A lot of plot/dialogue inconsistencies. What up with Leia surviving space??

What I want for Ep. 9,"I read the story for TLJ before watching, and at first I hated it. After watching TLJ I really liked where the story took the characters.
This is what I would like to see in ep. 9.

1. Resistance and FO are both destroyed in war. Kylo survives, Rey survives, (Finn/Rose/Poe/Chewie dead- the droids probably survive)

2. The galaxy now has no main government.

3. Kylo realizes how meaningless his struggle was with most of his army destroyed and his parents gone.

4. Rey goes into hiding and teaches other Force-sensitives the way of the Force.

Yes this is a very depressing ending but I don’t want to see something too similar to ROTJ. The galaxy returning to a “blank state” would be the will of the Force(at least in my opinion) and Kylo not becoming redeemed would be fitting for his story arc. He’s become Supreme Leader now and there’s no turning back. As for Rey she is now the last of the Jedi, and will pave the way for a new generation of Force users.

This is just one person’s opinion, please feel free to share your thoughts- I’d like to know what you think!

EDIT: I should note that Kylo realizing his faults is at the end of the movie. Also it would feel more complete if Kylo asks Rey to kill him and Rey does so.",StarWars,True,1515823427,2018-01-13

Watched TLJ. Thoughts on Snoke and Kylo,"Really would like to bounce my thoughts with others. 
--------Spoilers below!!!-----------

I read from an interview Rian wants the story to focus more on Kylo's development by killing Snoke so unceremoniously. 
However, it seemed like Kylo was in his early stages of training (he got owned by Rey - someone who never held a lightsaber- edit: he was severely handicapped in that fight). 
In my mind, that would put him at a Padawan level equivalent of the dark side. 
It seemed like there was still much for Kylo to learn regarding powers, force, and lightsaber usage. 
With Snoke dead, wouldn't Kylo's training stop? Wouldn't his growth be stunted without a master, despite the intention to develop him?
I suppose he could continue cultivating his force connection, but he seems to lack control and refinement in technique. 
On the other side, Rey got very minimal training (time seemed to only allow a few basic lessons). She also exhibits ""crude and unrefined power."" 
When we look at the story's protagonist and antagonist this way, it is like 2 newbies discovering themselves in the adolescent stage of force growth, both without teachers to guide and encourage their maturation. 
I fear the development the writers sought has been stunted. 
My analogy to Kylo being a Padawan may be too harsh, but if we are to draw a parallel to say Anakin, Kylo seems to be at the stage Palpatine just took him under his wing. It took years more of training and teachings from the master to achieve the level of malice and power Vader had toward the end of his career. 

I am thinking of the stages of learning: 
1) you don't know what you don't know
2) you know what you don't know
3) you take steps to learn what you don't know
4) level up; repeat

Kylo going forward will be stuck at stage1, as there are no more powerful dark siders to teach him. 

What do you all think?

[Spoilers] The Last Jedi (and other films) borrowing from the original ESB screenplay,"I'm reading parts of the original ESB screenplay, and it seems like the writers of TLJ borrowed stuff from it.

In one scene, ""Minch"" (whose character later became Yoda) instructs Luke to "" Reach out with it. Reach for the Force…the Force that runs between the stars, between the galaxies.  The Force that lights the suns, and sparks the life in all of us…tree and fish, bird and animal, man and creatures such as I.  Reach for it, Luke.  Reach…""

Luke reaches out, Rey-style, and reaches Darth Vader in his Rogue One castle, who is busy feeding evil porg-like gargoyles.

Luke senses the darkness and Minch does everything he can do bring him back.

After this, Minch tells Luke that he is more powerful than him or obi-wan, and that he doesn't just use the force, he rends it. This is the equivalent of Luke's ""I've seen this raw power only once before.""

Additionally, in this screenplay Vader is not Luke's father, and Luke says he is ""nobody"". The Emperor is described as wearing a Snoke-style gold robe. Luke levitates fruit from a basket like Anakin in AOTC. And Minch duels Obi-Wan's force ghost!

(TLJ spoilers) Can we discuss the costume design in The Last Jedi? What were your thoughts?,"I was inspired to make this thread because I’m not one to typically note costume design in films, but I did make a note of it after watching The Last Jedi.

I loved the way the Praetorian Guards looked, those red forms were sick and a nice homage to the emperor’s red guard. 

Loved Luke’s outfit when he force projected himself to face Kylo.

Rey’s was cool, although I’m a bit disappointed she didn’t end up with a large outfit change after TFA, although I understand given where she was in the context of the story it would be difficult to give her a whole new ensemble at any point. 

I liked Finn’s look in the imperial uniform, that was sick.

I think what disappointed me the most was Canto Blight. Obviously Canto Blight has received a bulk of criticism in TLJ, and I think better costume(and maybe alien design) would have gone a long way there to making that scene feel like “Star Wars”. Sure it was interesting to see Tuxedo’s in the Star Wars universe, but it really fucked with me. Maybe that was a “subversion”, but it didn’t work well in my opinion. One of the great parts about Star Wars is the unique designs they can give in such an infinitely galactic universe, and they go with modern American tuxedos? That really disappointed me. Would’ve loved to see a unique space-casino type style there! The overall setting of the place was really cool and well done, so the tuxedos disappointed for sure.

I’m somewhat torn on Snoke’s gold robe. On one hand, it’s very interesting for the character and shows his arrogance and what-not, but it did take me out a little bit. It just felt...very odd. Not sure if I would say I hated it or i was disappointed, but I thought there could’ve been more done.

Overall, I think the film happening so shortly after TFA hurt the uniform department a bit, and i hope a longer gap between TLJ and episode 9 will allow us to see some classic new styles on our favorite characters(Luke with the blue light saber and orange rebel outfit from Hoth was one of my favorite looks)

"My thoughts on the nature of the dark side, light side, and balance.","You can show fear and anger, but simply showing fear and anger isn't part of the dark side.  
The dark side is when you start acting on fear and anger, making decisions based on them, enhancing your power by increasing your fear and anger, etc.  

Feeling fear and anger is fine, it's natural and unavoidable, but letting them influence your actions is a terrible idea, especially while you're holding a lightsaber and making life or death decisions.  
Everyone should strive to use rationality in those situations, as much as possible, that's what the light side is about, always trying to impartially, selflessly, and logically, determine the right course of action in any given situation.  

I do think that there needs to be a change within the Jedi Order, but I don't think that this change should involve any acceptance of the dark side.  
They need to start accepting that having emotions is natural and unavoidable, and that ignoring them and letting them build up unnoticed as a result is a stupid idea.  
They need to make it so that attachments and relationships and such are allowed, and then simply teach people to not let those attachments cause them to behave selfishly, especially not in combat scenarios and while using the force.  

Using the dark side in any high stakes scenario is like using a bazooka, while drunk, in an attempt to solve a hostage scenario, it's just a terrible idea.
And using the dark side in a low stakes scenario is still a bad idea, because it's just a bad way of thinking and will negatively affect your behavior in general, by infecting your brain with that mindset.  ",StarWars,True,1515856462,2018-01-13
Legends are not what they seem (Spoilers),"

I get the feeling this major theme of the film is why a large portion of the fan base seems so adverse towards TLJ, because the whole point is the subversion of our ideas of these characters. 

Luke is the most important piece of this theme so I’ll start with him. We as an audience, as well as Rey and the rest of the resistance, expect to find EU Luke on Achh-To, an overpowered badass who is fundamentally the same person he was in the OT. 
But Rey, instead, finds a grumpy old man, who-after a grave mistake, which he can’t undo, and has led to a new era of darkness for the Galaxy-has shut himself off from the force. Luke is an extremely emotional character, so his split second mistake (which he regretted immediately, he wasn’t actually going to KILL Kylo) makes perfect sense for his base character. But it’s been 30 years since we’ve seen Luke, he’s going to have changed as a person in that time...are YOU the same person you were 30 years ago? I doubt it, ideals and your outlook change over 30 years...Just having an old looking OT Luke would make less sense than the Luke we got. 
After redeeming himself from this mistake, by saving the rest of the Resistance, and his sister, he is finally ready to give himself over to the force, and be at peace with himself, which is emotionally very important for him to do as a character. His death isn’t meaningless, it’s an emotional moment, he has accepted his past, but understands that it doesn’t define him, and we as an audience need to do this as well, it’s good to accept the past as existing, but we need to accept that it’s over, and let the new cast take the lead, the story isn’t about the old cast, but the new, so no wonder they’re all killed off (bar Leia bizarrely).

Secondly, Rey’s parents. A lot of people seem to be angry that her parents weren’t anybody, and that Rian had gone off JJ’s plans, which he didn’t. Just because they weren’t anybody we know, doesn’t mean that the reveal is lessened. Just like the audience, Rey WANTS her parents to be someone, she WANTS the validation that she didn’t come from nothing...but she did, and that’s an incredibly powerful and emotional moment for her. She needs to learn to stop living in the past, same as the audience, and that greatness CAN come from nothing. An emotional moment will always be better than a bit of fan-service (look at how Anakin built C-3PO, that’s way worse than 3PO just being a protocol droid caught up in a galactic war.)

Now a short one: Rose and Finn. Rose sees Finn as a major Resistance Hero, only to find out that he was planning on deserting (which isn’t out of character, right up till the end of TFA Finn just wanted to run away with Rey, that was the only reason he was on Starkiller Base). This reveal breaks her heart, and adds to the ever increasing shades of grey between good and bad she and the audience see throughout the film, and their subplot.

Now Snoke. The AUDIENCE took mystery and intrigue from his appearance in TFA and, unlike Rey’s parents, there were no actual questions asked about his identity. He is unimportant to the story, as KYLO not Snoke is the main antagonist, it’s his story, not Snoke’s. Now ask yourself, how would Snoke’s identity have been revealed to us in TLJ? Because the only way that could’ve been done is through some EXTREMELY ham-fisted and strained dialogue. You can’t dedicate a visual montage or story for Snoke, as, again, he’s unimportant. 
One such line might have been: “You are insolent Ren, I had no hesitation in killing my parents, and taking my rightful place as Ruler of a new order, but you are cowardly and weak”. Such a line would’ve felt VERY forced and strained. It’s much like a gay character (like Bill in Dr Who) beating you over the head with forced dialogue about their sexuality, if it’s unimportant to the story being told...DON’T INCLUDE IT! (And no I don’t have a problem with gay characters, but sexuality is irrelevant if it’s superfluous to the story being told, they can be whatever sexuality you want them to be, just don’t force dialogue for the sake of diversity)
His death, therefore, is not pointless, it’s giving way for the lead’s story, as Snoke, unlike the Emperor isn’t the Big Bad, Kylo is.

The lightsaber: Why does Luke just toss it? Isn’t it this big important object? We as an audience, and characters like Rey, have PLACED importance into the lightsaber, yes it’s been through a lot, but to the people who use it, it’s just an appliance, and doesn’t really matter. The lightsaber, similarly, is an object of the past, which Luke is trying to forget, and leave behind him, so of course he tosses it. To him this Lightsaber does not bear the importance we have placed upon it, he hasn’t seen it in years, so it doesn’t matter anymore.",StarWars,True,1515856579,2018-01-13

Right now it's unthinkable that Lucasfilm would attempt to revive their old universe while they're still hard at work establishing the new canon at as fast a pace as they possibly can, but after the inevitable nostalgia for Kyle Katarn and the bad Clone Wars comics sets in, maybe ten or more years from now, do you think they might start publishing new material under the Legends banner?

Like set it far enough back in the the past that you see a Jedi order that is more emotional and connected than that of the prequels. But that connection leads to conflict with themselves or others. It could be the reason why the first Jedi Civil War occurs, With Revan and Malak maybe, and then the whole thing ends at Malacor (Is it V still) when the ancient Sith temple is used to destroy the Sith and Jedi fighting there. The aftermath of which is shown in Rebels S3. That's kind of what I'd be interested in seeing, not 100% sold on it. But hey what do you want see in that trilogy?",StarWars,True,1515864247,2018-01-13

Anakin's frustrations explained in The Clone Wars.,"I think we all can agree that Dave Filoni and The Clone Wars series did a great a job in fixing Anakin's character. The series added so much depth to the character and portrayed the strong relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan; order 66 and the duel on Mustafar were much more emotional after watching TCW series. 

We can assign his anger in EII to his nightmares and the death of his mother. He seemed to have let this go or has buried it in TCW. As he tells Ahsoka many times, he didn't want to talk about his past. He was truly the poster boy for the Jedi order in TCW. And yet in EIII he seemed to have reverted back to his old self. Why?

[In this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm854yq38jY),where Obi-Wan Kenobi bids farewell to his best friend and apprentice for the final time, Anakin mentions that he's been frustrated with the council. There are multiple reasons for this as seen TCW: 

* Ahsoka's trail- The most common and well known reason is that the Jedi council falsely accused Ahsoka and expelled her from the Jedi order. Furthermore, with the exception of Plo Koon and a few others, the council was unapologetic towards Ahsoka when she was found innocent. Mace Windu, who was the one to officially expel Ahsoka during the trail, simply dismissed the incident as her 'great trail' as a Jedi. 



* Mace Windu- While we're on the topic of Mace Windu, let's talk about his role in Anakin's turn to the dark side. Mace Windu has made it clear that he doesn't trust Anakin. What does the man have to do to gain his trust? Anakin, Obi-Wan and Plo Koon were most often in the front lines during the clone wars. Anakin, especially, has done many heroic deeds during the war (literally too long to list here) in service of the Jedi Order and The Republic. But Mace still resented and distrusted Anakin? Anakin would have sensed Windu's feelings towards him and would have further contributed to his frustrations. Getting off a topic a bit, much like Plo Koon was meant to portray Anakin Skywalker as he should have been (as I've discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/6h195v/i_think_plo_koon_would_have_been_the_perfect/)), Mace Windu represented everything wrong with the Jedi order during the twilight of The Republic; strong with the force, powerful, at the height of their power but blinded by arrogance and over-devotion to a code. 


* The death of ARC trooper Fives- Fives was probably one of Anakin's best and most loyal soldiers. Upon his death, the council never investigated Fives' accusations of The Chancellor and the inhibitor chips. 


* The events after Dooku's revelation- In season 6 episode 10, Anakin and Obi-Wan discover that Tyrannus was Count Dooku. Upon revealing this news to the council Yoda and Windu were quick to bury this news, fearing a loss of confidence in the war and the Jedi order.

In this instance he's abandoning ""the Sith"", he's abandoning the master that lured him to the Dark Side, ""Snoke"". He's trying to show Rey that she too does not need her flawed associates: ""Skywalker...the Jedi, the Rebels"". 

""Don't do this Ben. Please don't go this way""...even Rey ignores what he said - this doesn't make sense.

It is Ren's following emotion-filled expression, ""you're still holding on...let go!"", that brings me to the conclusion that HAD Rey joined Ren then the **two** would have brought in the *Gray Code* (Gray Jedi, but that title gives it too much affiliation with the Jedi Order, of which its principles differ or ideally **should** differ from).

Rey's betrayal (the film maker's betrayal in fact) of Ren/Ben is what killed it for me, displaying that the franchise just isn't willing to take a step outside the comfort zone of this never-ending **polar conflict** (between the Sith and Jedi).

The Genocide of the Sith and other questions,"I have a couple of questions about the genocide of the Sith and the similarity between the Old Jedi and the New (Clone War Era) Jedi. 

1. What was the relation of the Sith (the race) and the Sith (the evil force users). Ultimately why did this cause the Old Jedi to feel the need to completely erase the Sith (the race) from the universe. Surely the Old Jedi believed there were innocent Sith (the race) yet they seemingly executed them regardless. 

2. Just how similar were the Old Jedi to the new Jedi? Would the yoda-era council believe to exterminate the Sith (the race) as well? Or were the Old Jedi more evil?

3. Bringing balance to the force. This contradiction is something that confuses me. During the Clone Era, the Jedi Council believes they must bring “balance to the force” yet wouldn’t this call for the existence of both the Sith (dark side force users) and the Jedi?

4. Bringing balance to the force part II. If the Clone War Era Jedi truly believe in bringing balance to the force wouldn’t they try to not exclude the dark side to themselves? To perfectly match the light side with the dark side within themselves? Or perhaps the dark side temptations are too powerful for them that they believe they must ignore the dark side completely? 

NOTE: I am aware many parts of these questions may not have answers and may only be speculated however I have been thinking about these myself for the last couple days and am curious to what others, that are more knowledgeable than I am, believe.

Rogue One's music is amazing.,"I have not watched RO in a year and watched it recently. I must say, this movie is a masterpiece and the music is severely underrated and needs more recognition. 
Honestly, i don't understand the hate. Giachino probably listened to and studied the music in Episode 4 for hundreds of hours. Also TL: DR, everything I say is in here and more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGVqPP-52No 

So, the first thing we notice musically about rogue one is no crawl and theme music, tbh I was actually bummed that it wasn't in it. But like what that video says basically it is in there, in the theme of rogue one.

Take a look at the melody notes for both the Rogue One theme and the Star Wars theme (the first seven seconds of the main part of the theme) and remove repeating notes in both pieces and order theme on ascending order. They end up being the same notes. As the guy says ""oh my god, do you literally have to have it spelt out for you"" Giachino took the core notes of the main theme of Star Wars and used them in his theme.

Not only that, Giachino uses leitmotifs right. Leitmotifs being when a character (being someone or something) appears or is mentioned a part of there theme is made. in Rogue One it's used a good bunch but not so much that it's annoying. This is something the prequels and even the sequels are missing (Rey's theme plays even when a tiny thing has something to do with her, in TLJ we heard it first when there's a shot of Skellig Michael(Ahch-to I think)). 

Examples? When Bail shows up it plays the Force Theme (Binary Sunset) and also when talking about Obi-Wan and a second later, when he's talking about Leia her theme plays, although it's easy to miss. The Rebellion them plays when the rebellion comes into play. A little one a missed on multiple viewings was that the Death Star Leitmotif plays (this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_5MZYxY-QY) When we first see the Death Star, we see its weapon being installed. when the camera pans from the Star Destroyers to the disk the leitmotif plays.

Also,(said in the video) those flutes that play when Luke finds Leia's message in R2 is played 3 times in this movie. When Saw's men are taking Jyn and Cassian to his place, right before Cassian speaks to Bhodi and when they ask to open the shield over Scarif. Giachino made a leitmotif for messengers. Brilliant

Basically what I'm trying to say is, why is Star Wars so fucking awesome. We didn't deserve it. Pray to thee, Emporer William sand his apprentice Lord Giachino. 

Also, Giachino composed UP sooooooooo........ ",StarWars,True,1515876463,2018-01-13

Planet Variety—good or bad?,"So with the release of TLJ, we have three new Star Wars entries. And, with a few exceptions, Corusaunt, Yavin 4, and Mustafar in R1, all have featured new planets and locations.

How do you guys feel about the variety/familiarity of planets and locations in the SW Galaxy? Should we continue to return to some places or keep introducing new worlds? Should writers consider existing locations before creating new ones? And what about references to previously mentioned worlds?

I personally love when we return to a planet or get a reference to a place introduced in other media. It makes the universe feel more full and deep in my opinion, and guards against creating new one-off planets for a story. I’m not a fan of having separate prequel, original, and sequel worlds (ie seen only in ROTS, for example, and never mentioned again) although it’s true that it’s a big galaxy.

/s My personal version of The Last Jedi,"Hey everybody! 

Firstly, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johnson's version of the Last Jedi, enough to see it three times ha. The film isn't perfect by any means, but I didn't have any of the vitriol some other Star Wars fans have been having with the film since it came out. Being a writer and a storyteller myself, I did have some thoughts of how I would change the story to make it more of my own vision. So, bearing in mind what Rian Johnson were presented with, here is what I would personally change or fix about The Last Jedi

- The beginning bombing sequence is very fun, but establishment of major characters during this sequence could have been done better. I would have liked to add a scene of the rebels prepping to fly off against the Dreadnaught. Poe can be his dashing fun self and jump into his black X-Wing with BB-8. After a small segment with Poe, we set up a small scene between Rose and her sister Page. In The Last Jedi, we only know of Page and Rose’s sibling relationship because of a weird medallion that is never fully explained, and you can include that in this scene if you want to bring the two of them together by material means, but I felt we needed to see the two interact together. The scene could maybe consist of Page, the older sister, laughing about how she will definitely return after the attack in a cocky, (almost Han Solo) type of way, and Rose can be the more humble of the two and is more concerned that the Resistance just won a huge battle against Starkiller base and that she feels they need to focus on running. The two part on hopeful terms but this ends up being self fulfilling when Page eventually sacrifices herself in the attack. Rose is understandably distraught and vows to do whatever she can to avenge her sisters death.  

- The First Order chase sequence / fuel shortage / tracking through hyperspace can occur as written, however I would have added a sequence where Admiral Ackbar, Holdo, Leia, and maybe a few other important leaders of the Resistance can have a scene where they think they are safe and begin to formulate a new plan for a new Resistance base. Not only does this give more screen time to a fantastic Laura Dern, but also gives Ackbar another scene to be Ackbar before, inevitably, the First Order somehow has found them.  

- We can have our Kylo Ren scene where he hesitates before firing, however the two Tie fighters still blast torpedoes at the bridge. Having Leia notice him through the Force can occur, but instead of the bridge being utterly destroyed, it is just heavily damaged. The main view port of the bridge is beginning to weaken, threatening all of the injured on the bridge to be blown into the vacuum of space. Holdo and Ackbar are pinned under some broken panels of the ship. Leia is miraculously unharmed, but is cut off from the main entrance to the bridge, which is the means for her own escape. As the view screen begins to crack and weaken more, Leia, in a last ditch heroic effort to save her friends, uses the force to lift the wreckage off of Ackbar and Holdo, allowing them to escape. She shares a last, loving and longing look at Holdo, Ackbar, and maybe even Poe, before the view screen breaks and launches her into space, giving Leia the type of heroes end that she deserved. Holdo, Ackbar, and the remaining bridge crew go to a secondary meeting room to discuss their options/next move.  

- Finn awakens at this point and is confronted with worrying feelings about Rey. His interaction with Poe can be fully clothed and somber, as Poe is distraught over Leia’s death. Wanting to do his part, Finn joins the remaining leaders of the Resistance in Ackbar and Holdo as they discuss their next move. Here is where we can have a few of my films main changes play out.  

- The First Order can track the Resistance ships through hyperspace via a tracking device aboard one of the Resistance ships. The main task for Finn/Rose/Poe is investigating the Resistances remaining ships to find the tracking device instead of the Canto Bight sequence, which we can all agree was garbage. It streamlines and simplifies the movies many threads and gives it more focus IMO 

- The Resistance ships are faster and lighter, so they can stay out of range of the large guns of the First Order ships, but not for very long.  

- To harass the Resistance ships, the First Order can launch a few fighter squadrons that the Resistance have to try and defend against with very few remaining fighter ships of their own. This is where we can have Poe really come into his own as a leader, which will inevitably help set up his eventual command of the Resistance in Episode 9.  

- Finn, because of his knowledge of First Order technology, is the main “codebreaker” who can identify what the device looks like. While Finn can find the tracker, he doesn’t know how to disable it. This is where Rose volunteers and with some computer slicing magic, finds the location of the tracker. 
 
- The tracker is stationed in a very heavily damaged part of the main ship and she doesn’t quite know how to get to it. This is where we can have Benicio Del Toro’s character in DJ, who in my version is another mechanic with a drug problem instead of a weird stuttering dude who’s in prison, come in and also volunteer to help.  

- Holdo and Ackbar then come up with a contingency plan to covertly sneak the personnel of the Resistance away from the cruisers, searching nearby star maps where they eventually find an old rebel base on the planet Craite.  

- The rest of this portion of the story is Finn, Rose, and DJ move through harrowing parts of the half destroyed Resistance main ship to find the device and disable it. All the while Poe is primarily patrolling and fighting First Order ships in space, losing pilots on both sides until there is only a handful of Resistance craft left. They find the device after some dangerous maneuvering in heavily damaged portions of the ship, but also find that even if they destroy it, the resistance ships have expended enough of their fuel to not be able to jump to hyperspace. This leads to Holdo and Ackbar’s contingency taking effect.  

- Ackbar decides to do the old sea captain “go down with the ship” and gives the reins of the Resistance leadership to Holdo. As a last ditch effort to mask the escape craft heading to Craite, Ackbar rams Snoke’s main cruiser and heavily damages it. We however know his sacrifice is somewhat for naught, as Hux notices the escape craft heading for Craite. 

While all this is happening, the Rey/Luke storyline can play out somewhat similarly as it did in the original film, however with a few additions.
	
- Personally, one of the main problems that I have with Rey is that we never see her learn these skills, so when she finds the old Jedi texts, we have a scene or two of her studying ferociously over them. We can even have a scene where Luke berates her, only to have his own ideals at this time rebuked by the hope in Rey’s ideology. This leads to a very important scene that I felt was missing in the original film. After a moment with master Yoda, who at this point can have his speech about having hope in a new pupil, Luke takes out his old lightsaber and begins teaching Rey. A montage of her meditating on the rock/practicing her lightsaber techniques/as well as physical training can occur and parallel Luke’s own study with Yoda.  

- The Rey/Kylo force connection can occur during this time and can remain pretty unchanged, however 		 	this is kept secret from Luke. 

- There comes a point during her training the Luke finds out about the Rey/Kylo connection, and seeing as 		Rey is at Kylo’s level of power after just a few days of training, decides to stop training her. 
	
This brings me to one of the biggest changes I would make for the film. 

- Instead of Luke’s personal failure in thinking, even for a split second, that he’ll kill Ben Solo because of the dark side within him, which in my version will come a little later, he instead fails at seeing the progress and eventual complete corruption of Kylo by Snoke. It begins as a montage of the viewers seeing Kylo Ren go from a young, happy student, to using finding he is more powerful then the other students and becomes arrogant. His anger begins to grow through Snoke’s manipulation, and eventually leads him to using this dark side power to beat some of Luke’s other pupils in Lightsaber training.
  
- There can even be a scene of him hurting another student badly, and this is where Luke realizes and sees Kylo revel in his abuse of power. This is where Luke, just like in the film, begins to covertly investigate Kylo. He eventually looks deep enough into the force to sense the incredible dark side power, (who is really Snoke and his influence), within Kylo. He has the moment of failure when he turns on the lightsaber to kill Kylo in his sleep, and it gives Kylo the final nudge he needs after all of the manipulating by Snoke to turn against the Jedi and destroy it. 

- Rey and Luke can have their confrontation that resolves in Rey being disillusioned with Luke. She ultimately believes that Kylo can be turned back to the light side, and goes off to confront him and Smoke. Luke stays behind, defeated that he has once again failed another one of his pupils. In that moment of defeat, Luke goes to destroy the Jedi tree and the texts. He has his encounter with Yoda and the rest of the island story can occur as in the original film. 

The Rey/Kylo/Snoke arc can remain largely unchanged. Snoke can die by Kylo’s hand and Kylo can become the new Supreme Leader of the First Order. Hux informs Kylo of the resistance retreat to Craite and the Hothesque battle can occur, with a few minor changes. 

- Holdo is the one leading the Resistance, and tells them to set up what little defenses they can for a last stand.

- Instead of the weird skiffs the resistance use, they instead use junky Snowspeeders. Because Parallels! 

- Rose is the one to go on the suicide run of the large First Order laser weapon instead of Finn. Finn is the one to save her, but instead of their forced romance, he just drags her unconscious body back to the old Rebel base. Before he can get there, Captain Phasma and a bunch of stormtroopers surround and capture them, and this is where we leave Finn and Rose’s characters until Episode 9. 

The ending of the film is relatively unchanged, save for a small scene where Rey, the Last Jedi, meets Holdo and Poe for the first time. When wondering about Finn, Poe can say he saw them being taken away by the First Order. In this last scene we can have a final Force conversation with Rey and Kylo. 
	The new Supreme Leader boasts that he will take everything Rey cares about from her, just like everything was taken away from him by Luke as a boy. We see him finally take in and succumb to all of the anger and hatred that fuels his power in the dark side, and this manifests itself in his eyes transforming into those of a Sith Lord. He cuts off their connection by telling Rey that she will be the last Jedi he is to kill before he takes over the galaxy. 
	Rey, having gone through a tremendous amount of personal growth, is unafraid of Kylo’s threats. She tells him she trusts in the force, and that it will guide her to the light. She says she pities him, and that they will meet for a final time soon. Then, as Rey boards the Millennium Falcon, she senses something behind her. Luke, in his force ghost form, gives her a smile and a nod before disappearing. The Falcon soars into the atmosphere of Craite before jumping to lightspeed.

Rose is understandably distraught and vows to do whatever she can to avenge her sisters death.  

- The First Order chase sequence / fuel shortage / tracking through hyperspace can occur as written, however I would have added a sequence where Admiral Ackbar, Holdo, Leia, and maybe a few other important leaders of the Resistance can have a scene where they think they are safe and begin to formulate a new plan for a new Resistance base. Not only does this give more screen time to a fantastic Laura Dern, but also gives Ackbar another scene to be Ackbar before, inevitably, the First Order somehow has found them.  

- We can have our Kylo Ren scene where he hesitates before firing, however the two Tie fighters still blast torpedoes at the bridge. Having Leia notice him through the Force can occur, but instead of the bridge being utterly destroyed, it is just heavily damaged. The main view port of the bridge is beginning to weaken, threatening all of the injured on the bridge to be blown into the vacuum of space. Holdo and Ackbar are pinned under some broken panels of the ship. Leia is miraculously unharmed, but is cut off from the main entrance to the bridge, which is the means for her own escape. As the view screen begins to crack and weaken more, Leia, in a last ditch heroic effort to save her friends, uses the force to lift the wreckage off of Ackbar and Holdo, allowing them to escape. She shares a last, loving and longing look at Holdo, Ackbar, and maybe even Poe, before the view screen breaks and launches her into space, giving Leia the type of heroes end that she deserved. Holdo, Ackbar, and the remaining bridge crew go to a secondary meeting room to discuss their options/next move.  

- Finn awakens at this point and is confronted with worrying feelings about Rey. His interaction with Poe can be fully clothed and somber, as Poe is distraught over Leia’s death. Wanting to do his part, Finn joins the remaining leaders of the Resistance in Ackbar and Holdo as they discuss their next move. Here is where we can have a few of my films main changes play out.  

- The First Order can track the Resistance ships through hyperspace via a tracking device aboard one of the Resistance ships. The main task for Finn/Rose/Poe is investigating the Resistances remaining ships to find the tracking device instead of the Canto Bight sequence, which we can all agree was garbage. It streamlines and simplifies the movies many threads and gives it more focus IMO 

- The Resistance ships are faster and lighter, so they can stay out of range of the large guns of the First Order ships, but not for very long.  

- To harass the Resistance ships, the First Order can launch a few fighter squadrons that the Resistance have to try and defend against with very few remaining fighter ships of their own. This is where we can have Poe really come into his own as a leader, which will inevitably help set up his eventual command of the Resistance in Episode 9.  

- Finn, because of his knowledge of First Order technology, is the main “codebreaker” who can identify what the device looks like. While Finn can find the tracker, he doesn’t know how to disable it. This is where Rose volunteers and with some computer slicing magic, finds the location of the tracker. 
 
- The tracker is stationed in a very heavily damaged part of the main ship and she doesn’t quite know how to get to it. This is where we can have Benicio Del Toro’s character in DJ, who in my version is another mechanic with a drug problem instead of a weird stuttering dude who’s in prison, come in and also volunteer to help.  

- Holdo and Ackbar then come up with a contingency plan to covertly sneak the personnel of the Resistance away from the cruisers, searching nearby star maps where they eventually find an old rebel base on the planet Craite.  

- The rest of this portion of the story is Finn, Rose, and DJ move through harrowing parts of the half destroyed Resistance main ship to find the device and disable it. All the while Poe is primarily patrolling and fighting First Order ships in space, losing pilots on both sides until there is only a handful of Resistance craft left. They find the device after some dangerous maneuvering in heavily damaged portions of the ship, but also find that even if they destroy it, the resistance ships have expended enough of their fuel to not be able to jump to hyperspace. This leads to Holdo and Ackbar’s contingency taking effect.  

- Ackbar decides to do the old sea captain “go down with the ship” and gives the reins of the Resistance leadership to Holdo. As a last ditch effort to mask the escape craft heading to Craite, Ackbar rams Snoke’s main cruiser and heavily damages it. We however know his sacrifice is somewhat for naught, as Hux notices the escape craft heading for Craite. 

While all this is happening, the Rey/Luke storyline can play out somewhat similarly as it did in the original film, however with a few additions.
	
- Personally, one of the main problems that I have with Rey is that we never see her learn these skills, so when she finds the old Jedi texts, we have a scene or two of her studying ferociously over them. We can even have a scene where Luke berates her, only to have his own ideals at this time rebuked by the hope in Rey’s ideology. This leads to a very important scene that I felt was missing in the original film. After a moment with master Yoda, who at this point can have his speech about having hope in a new pupil, Luke takes out his old lightsaber and begins teaching Rey. A montage of her meditating on the rock/practicing her lightsaber techniques/as well as physical training can occur and parallel Luke’s own study with Yoda.  

- The Rey/Kylo force connection can occur during this time and can remain pretty unchanged, however this is kept secret from Luke. 

- There comes a point during her training the Luke finds out about the Rey/Kylo connection, and seeing as Rey is at Kylo’s level of power after just a few days of training, decides to stop training her. 
	
This brings me to one of the biggest changes I would make for the film. 

- Instead of Luke’s personal failure in thinking, even for a split second, that he’ll kill Ben Solo because of the dark side within him, which in my version will come a little later, he instead fails at seeing the progress and eventual complete corruption of Kylo by Snoke. It begins as a montage of the viewers seeing Kylo Ren go from a young, happy student, to using finding he is more powerful then the other students and becomes arrogant. His anger begins to grow through Snoke’s manipulation, and eventually leads him to using this dark side power to beat some of Luke’s other pupils in Lightsaber training.
  
- There can even be a scene of him hurting another student badly, and this is where Luke realizes and sees Kylo revel in his abuse of power. This is where Luke, just like in the film, begins to covertly investigate Kylo. He eventually looks deep enough into the force to sense the incredible dark side power, (who is really Snoke and his influence), within Kylo. He has the moment of failure when he turns on the lightsaber to kill Kylo in his sleep, and it gives Kylo the final nudge he needs after all of the manipulating by Snoke to turn against the Jedi and destroy it. 

- Rey and Luke can have their confrontation that resolves in Rey being disillusioned with Luke. She ultimately believes that Kylo can be turned back to the light side, and goes off to confront him and Smoke. Luke stays behind, defeated that he has once again failed another one of his pupils. In that moment of defeat, Luke goes to destroy the Jedi tree and the texts. He has his encounter with Yoda and the rest of the island story can occur as in the original film. 

The Rey/Kylo/Snoke arc can remain largely unchanged. Snoke can die by Kylo’s hand and Kylo can become the new Supreme Leader of the First Order. Hux informs Kylo of the resistance retreat to Craite and the Hothesque battle can occur, with a few minor changes. 

- Holdo is the one leading the Resistance, and tells them to set up what little defenses they can for a last stand.

- Instead of the weird skiffs the resistance use, they instead use junky Snowspeeders. Because Parallels! 

- Rose is the one to go on the suicide run of the large First Order laser weapon instead of Finn. Finn is the one to save her, but instead of their forced romance, he just drags her unconscious body back to the old Rebel base. Before he can get there, Captain Phasma and a bunch of stormtroopers surround and capture them, and this is where we leave Finn and Rose’s characters until Episode 9. 

The ending of the film is relatively unchanged, save for a small scene where Rey, the Last Jedi, meets Holdo and Poe for the first time. When wondering about Finn, Poe can say he saw them being taken away by the First Order. In this last scene we can have a final Force conversation with Rey and Kylo. 
	The new Supreme Leader boasts that he will take everything Rey cares about from her, just like everything was taken away from him by Luke as a boy. We see him finally take in and succumb to all of the anger and hatred that fuels his power in the dark side, and this manifests itself in his eyes transforming into those of a Sith Lord. He cuts off their connection by telling Rey that she will be the last Jedi he is to kill before he takes over the galaxy. 
	Rey, having gone through a tremendous amount of personal growth, is unafraid of Kylo’s threats. She tells him she trusts in the force, and that it will guide her to the light. She says she pities him, and that they will meet for a final time soon. Then, as Rey boards the Millennium Falcon, she senses something behind her. Luke, in his force ghost form, gives her a smile and a nod before disappearing. The Falcon soars into the atmosphere of Craite before jumping to lightspeed.

Kylo has to turn good.,[deleted],StarWars,True,1514922104,2018-01-02
"The Last Jedi got it all wrong, but out of them two major things standout.","The Last Jedi two major thing wrong (out a hundred smaller things)

**1. It abandons this notion of good vs. evil and argues for this vague notion of balance between the light side and the dark side.**

Star Wars is based on the monomyth narrative theory which focuses on **the hero's journey**. To summarize, in monomyth the hero goes to a fantastical land, fights bad guys, levels up and defeats the villain. Along the way, the hero is tempted by evil, and he/she must face their weakness. The major theme of the OT is resisting the evil that we all have we all have within ourselves, but despite our internal struggle we must fight the external battle and use good to **defeat** evil. 

In the Disney movies, I feel that this message is being traded in for a vague dualism where morality is subjective. We can see this when Kylo Ren talks about, ""Resisting the light."" As for the hero, Rey is no Luke Skywalker. While Rey and Luke began at the same point of moral understanding in force awakens and new hope, but whereas in the ESB Luke was starting to become aware of the dark side and its temptation. Rey in TLJ has seemingly become even more naive about the nature of good and evil. Which is further confused by Luke Skywalker, suddenly a moral subjectivist, in his talking about the Jedi being too 'strict' for adhering to a narrow ideology. Luke suddenly argues that the Jedi aren't right; they are the bullies! They need to be nicer to those dark siders! 

In the OT the light side was painted as this steep hill which Jedi had to climb, but one with one slip, a single moral lapse, they could fall off the cliff into the abyss of the dark side below. In the Disney films it more like, ""Eh, pick your side I'm good with either.""

**2. It got political** 

TLJ was obviously trying to get political. I theorize this is because of both Disney and Hollywood, being breeding grounds for extreme leftism, use everything and anything for political gain. The two most successful political parties on the left: Communism and Nazism demand that everything and anything must be used towards the common goal. The SJW culture in Hollywood requires total submission to their ideology; otherwise, there will be a backlash.

We can see this rampant leftism in that the good guys are once again 'the rebels.' It was a poor choice for Disney to create a new evil empire. It required to much time to explain why, after having defeated the previous empire, the first order came up to replace. Artistically, it would have been better to begin where the galaxy was unified under the New Republic and then show the threat of Snoke and his new empire. However, the recasting of the good guys as the *rebels* was made for political reasons. 

Extreme leftist ideology demands that they, the leftists, are the **victims**. But to be a victim, there must be a villain, and, if it suits the cause, the villain will be manufactured. For instance, in Nazi Germany, it was the Jews, in the Soviet Union, it was the 'breakers,' in Mao China, it was the rich, and in modern-day SJW culture, it is... well everything. Leftist ideology creates paranoid individuals that demand that someone is 'out to get them.' (Just because I'm paranoid... right?). Even when they are in power, there is always this 'greater evil' that is out to get them. 

Disney tried to create this villain in Snoke, and even though he was uninteresting and one-dimensional, he was good enough. In TFA and TLJ, the good guys are the rebels (again), the outcasts, the downtrodden and the misfits of society so then naturally their ranks must be filled with minorities and women. Those who the SJW culture claimed are the targets of the culture of *oppression* in America.

Personally, I don't care if Disney wants to be more diverse, more power to them, change things up a bit, make the films your own, go for it! Just please, don't lie to me that aren't making a political statement. However, their choice to be political rather than making the best artistic choice has cost them. Disney cast a lot of women in their films, but not because they were great actors who were women, but because they were women who could act. And they really can't act, most of them anyways. They introduced two new female characters, clearly last minute, and put them authoritative roles. It was pretty clear that Poe and Luke Skywalker were demoted to the stupid white men who were just getting in the way of the new gals. 

Disney wanted to portray women as strong, tough and who can *get things done!* Well, okay then, I don't think anyone in this civilized age would be against this. We all want girl and women to be free and to be independent. Just why did Disney have to do it at the cost of breaking down male masculinity? Hate to break it at Disney, but Star Wars was enjoyable because of uber-masculine white men who went off to save damsels in distress. Each of the OT films the guys went to save to Leia. Did that mean Leia was weak? No! Leia was awesome! The men didn't go to recuse her because they thought she was some weak ditsy little girl. Han, Luke, Lando, and Chewie went to save her because they **needed** her to complete the mission and save the day. 

The masculine Hero rescuing the feminine damsel in distress is a millennia-old trope. It isn't demeaning to women; it is a love letter. It is men's way of saying to women that, ""I love you so much that I am willing to risk my life for you."" It's beautiful. Yes, you can do the inverse of this, but artistically it very rarely works and typically isn't appealing to the majority of the public. 

Ironically, TLJ has no strong female role. You have Rey who is an emotional wreck unable to hold herself together and to explode into a bought rage and choreographed martial arts killing sprees. At the very least though she did resist the bad boy Kylo Ren who is the model for an abusive boyfriend. Holdo was supposed to be the empowered, mature woman, but she couldn't keep her subordinates together. Rose is utterly pointless, and Leia has so little screen time that she might as well not have been in the film.

There is no strong male role either. Luke Skywalker is a frail, afraid old man who wanted to kill his apprentice. Poe isn't a hero but runs around as a little child struck with ADD and paranoia. Kylo Ren is emo. Finn isn't a serious character.

TLJ confuses a strong woman for a masculine woman, and it argues that strong men are a bad thing.

(I will say though that both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are very good actors who bring life to their dull and uninteresting characters.)

**Conclusion:**
The majority of popular film and literature have a clear conflict between good &amp; evil, and it has strong male and female roles, with the male playing the role rescuer/peruser and the female playing the damsel/seductress. TLJ failed to have any of these, and not even CGI can cover that up. The film is intentionally revisionary to destroy the star wars legacy because of its depiction of absolute evil, which was be defeated.",StarWars,True,1514922560,2018-01-02

[Spoiler] Second Viewing,"After seeing TLJ, I was conflicted.   Like so many of you, I wasn't sure what to think.   I needed time to reflect on what I saw, and today, I went to see it a second time.   My thoughts after the second viewing:

I like The Last Jedi.   It was a very good movie, but it went in directions that nobody expected.   Was it perfect?   No.   No Star Wars movie is without plot holes, really very few (if any) movies are without.   But in a second watch, we saw a very different, non-derivative movie.    I feel like it is one of the best installments in the series, but I still have a few aspects I don't like.   Don't like the ""Flying Princess"" scene.   Doesn't work for me.   I wish there was a better backstory presented on Snoke before he died, but maybe they can address that in the next movie.   Rey's parentage?    I am now OK with where she came from.    The direction they have taken the series is that the Force does not belong to the Jedi, it belongs to everyone.   That's Rey's purpose.   A nobody can do what she does, so new force users will arise.   I actually kind of wish she hadn't rescued the Sacred Texts.   Maybe the Jedi should die, but a new religion can be born from the ashes.

I will stick with one assertion that I saw after the first viewing...I think the coolest scene in the entire series is when Luke brushes the dust off of his shoulder during the battle at Helm's Deep (er...Crait).   

I'm excited for the 9th installment.   The second viewing was worth it, it gave a better perspective on what I saw.   Thanks for indulging me.",StarWars,True,1514923269,2018-01-02

I want to delve into the pre-disney lore,"Hello there.  



Having watched all films a few times over the years, i recently found myself wanting to see more from the star wars universe. So i've just bought Knights Of The Old Republic and though i'm still early on in the game, i'm having loads of fun with it, in fact it seems very on par with lucas' world. And it made me realize how much cool stuff i may be missing.  

The thing is, there's an ocean of stuff out there ( comic books, novels etc ) and i have no idea where to start from.  What's more, i'm a bit confused about the ""status"" of the old expanded universe.




Were any of the comic books, novels and video games considered 
entirely cannon in their time? Was lucas himself aware or perhaps even involved with anything from the old expanded universe? Finally, what's your favourite star wars thing beside the movies and what would you consider essential? The clone wars series perhaps?

Let's Discuss Luke's Other Controversial Moment,"Ah, The Green Milk from the teet of the Thala-sirens.

A lot of people seem to think this scene was incredibly unnecessary and incredibly weird and over the top, (and it kind of intentionally is!) but I think aside from being a moment of levity, it also serves a very practical purpose in terms helping Rey address the reality of their situation. 

Rey, jacked up on stories of The Great Luke Skywalker, went to Achh-To hoping to recruit him to help destroy The First Order. She assume, like many, including us, the viewer, that he went their to discover some ancient Jedi secrets to help bring balance to the Force or something. Luke almost immediately dispels this notion at every possible turn. 

So, Rey now has to deal with this bitter and broken old hermit on a self imposed exile and the realities of his day to day life, and they aren't anything like the glamorous flights of fancy and study that she probably imagined he would be engaging in when she found him. 

It's a boring, frustrating, and in the case of the Green Milk, sometimes borderline ridiculous and unappetizing existence, that helps bring her idealization of the mythic and larger than life Luke Skywalker down to an uncomfortable, but very real level. 

In that moment, he's just a hungry and thirsty old man, (who also spent the early part of his life as a farmer!) getting sustenance one of the only practical ways you could be expected to do so on a remote island in the middle of nowhere; from the indigenous life surrounding him. Rey failed to recognize that, so this is intentionally jarring, both to her, and the viewer. 

It also gives Luke a bit of his Yoda Cooking Stew moment, similar to how in Empire Strikes Back, Luke expects to find a ""great warrior"" and instead finds this silly little creature eating a terrible stew in a hut, which completely goes against what he expected, but the hell else does he expect this Yoda to eat?

There are still arguments about whether or not the audience reactions are legitimate for The Last Jedi.,"People are *still* arguing on here over why The Last Jedi was good or not. But now it seems people are hellbent on saying that it has a *true* ~90% audience score and that people are **lying** about how well it's been received. So it appears both sides are now being manipulative then.

One site says it's closer to 50% another says it's 90% audience review score.

Now, we used to have a strawpoll on here from the megathreads that showed audience reactions from redditors. I can't post that without breaking the rules, but last I checked it was 66% liked it, 21% disliked it, and 14% had mixed feelings.

I know this is a subreddit for Star Wars so our own personal straw poll is going to be different from the average movie goer, but we can see just from that poll that the numbers are not close to 90% like some are suggesting.

Edit: I'm saying after this how I feel about the percentages but in no way am I saying this is what it *actually is*.

I'm not here to argue whether it's a  good film or not, I'm arguing that the audience reaction is not 90% in favor. I'm saying it's probably closer to 70% give or take that *liked it*. I would really just like both sides to say ""agree to disagree."" But there are more people than you think that have a serious problem or two with this film.

I can't post the poll but if you want to vote on it it's not hard to find.

[SPOILERS] Can we clear some things up about TLJ?,"I'm kind of tired seeing a lot of posts hating against Rian and TLJ. All of the ""plot holes"" most people are talking about are wrong. Here are my responses to some of the concerns you guys have:

#1. Rey's parents are nobodies

Kylo knows nothing about her parents. He was lying to her to bring out her anger, so he could convert her to the dark side. This is a tactic we have seen before in episode 3, when Palpatine told Vader that he murdered his wife, even though she was still alive. And would you really believe what any soon-to-be sith said? Kylo simply read Rey's mind and found one of her insecurities and used it against her. We still don't know anything about Rey's parents, and I bet we will see the real truth in episode 9.

#2. Rey wasn't trained with the light saber, she shouldn't be able to wield it as well as she did

She was never trained in the lightsaber specifically, but she was with her staff. If you remember in TFA, Rey used her staff to fight off a few people. She knows how to fight and it was a skill she developed while trying to survive as a loner. I believe her lightsaber abilities are totally justified and on top of that, she is strong with the force, which leads me to my next point.

#3. Rey is too strong with her force abilities, considering her little training

Before diving into this point, I just wanna compare Luke and Rey while they were training. If you recall in episode 5, Luke was pessimistic. He never really believed in his abilities. For example, Luke couldn't believe he could lift his ship from the swamp. He claimed that moving rocks and his ship were completely different things, in which Yoda responded with ""No! No different. Only different in your mind"" (around the 1:08 hour mark). Yoda then proceeded to lift the ship from the swamp. Luke throughout his training kept doubting himself and Yoda (like when he brought his lightsaber into the cave, when yoda specifically told him not to). 

Now let's look at Rey's training. She was the complete opposite of Luke. She was always optimistic and willing to give everything a try. She always believed in herself, no matter the odds. An example of this is when she successfully tricked the storm trooper in releasing her in TFA. She didn't stop after it didn't work for the first or second time. This is what makes her different from Luke. As Yoda said, moving rocks and a large spaceship is not different. When Rey moved all those large rocks at the end of TLJ, she had 100% confidence that she could move those rocks, and that's why she succeeded, unlike Luke. Lastly, force abilities come from being calm and relaxed. Rey always calmed herself and cleared her mind. Luke was always frustrated he couldn't wield the force like he wanted to.

#4. The Finn and Rose subplot was pointless

This is more subjective than any of the other points. I thought the subplot was a great character development for Finn. In the beginning of the movie, we see him trying to escape. He didn't believe in himself and thought that all hope was lost. The subplot showed him growing as a character; it showed him believing in himself more. And I liked the fact that they didn't succeed, otherwise it would have been predictable. I will admit some scenes in the subplot were a bit boring.

What was the significance of this scene in The Last Jedi?,"SPOILERS!!!!!!!

Saw this movie today and one scene that bothered me was the part with rey being trained by luke and she goes to the part of the island where the ""dark side"" is.
I get that rey wants to find out who her parents are so she goes to the ""dark side"" of the force, but the way it was represented was weird. I thought the dark side would have shown her something to try and seduce her to turn but it was just a bunch of copies of her-- what did that mean? Also what was the point of showing her snapping her fingers? The dark side seemed to have no control or influence on her besides luring her to see her parents. I dont see how this could be evil.

I guess my main grief is that the ""dark side"" was represented so weakly. She doesnt get tempted to change sides, she doesnt learn any new skills, she doesnt learn anything besides what she already knew, so what was the purpose of that scene?Whats the point of the ""dark side"" generally? It didnt seem to be all that malevolent.

Please tell me if im dumb or wrong but the dark side turned out to be much more lame than I thought it would be  ",StarWars,True,1514931000,2018-01-02
My problem with hyperspace ramming...,[removed],StarWars,True,1514931005,2018-01-02
[Spoilers] One reason why TLJ is one of the best Star Wars movies yet (IMO)...,"Its the characters in this movie. This movie successfully did what I thought neither episode VIII or IX could do; make me care about Kylo Ren, Rey, and Poe. After watching episode VII numerous times (Working at a movie theater really helps in these situations) I was not excited for TLJ because of a couple of factors: The movie was seriously ANH 2.0 with a couple of new scenes, the JJ mystery box strategy was so bad, Han Solo was killed too early (Should've been kept till VIII at least), the trilogy started off in the worst place possible (the movie should've explained the 3 decade gap a bit better IMO), and most importantly I DID NOT CARE ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS. Let me go into a bit of detail:

Kylo Ren was a Darth Vader wannabe... He was not threatening, he literally looked like a 15 year old, and I wanted nothing to do with Kylo, and I just wanted to see the actual Darth Vader back. TLJ did the best 180 I've ever seen with a sequel with a character. Rian Johnson destroyed the old winey Kylo Ren, and created a character so compelling, that he might become, if he isn't already, a better character than Darth Vader.... Nevermind, f*** it, he IS a better character than Darth Vader! His relationship with Rey is phenomenal, he isn't as mysterious and dark as Vader, but he is more realistic and HUMAN than Vader ever was. I'm not just saying the fact that Vader is a machine, Im saying that Kylo has more layers, and could be a brutal force in the last movie of this trilogy.

Rey: MA-REY SUUUUEEEEE???? (Pretty much my thoughts after TFA). Now, am I willing to say that Rey isn't a mary sue? Im not sure anymore, because Im invested in her now. Shes compelling, and now that she (maybe?) knows the truth about her parents, she is finally becoming her own character who makes her own decisions... finally. 

Poe: In TFA he was Wedge Antilles, that's not a good thing! Let us all acknowledge this: Admiral Ackbar, Wedge Antilles, and any other side character is NOT A GOOD LAYERED CHARACTER. Poe was charismatic, but he had no place in TFA. In TLJ he finally has a purpose: To become a leader like Leia, but in his pursuit to earn his title, he makes many mistakes along the way.... good. Without obstacles and mistakes, character development cannot occur. The character development in this movie is better than ESB, because we didn't need that movie to make us love the OT characters, ANH did that. We needed TLJ to finally give these characters purpose, and it succeeded phenomenally, and all I want from IX is to expand on these characters and not F*** IT UP.

Edit: Thanks for the discussions everyone, feel free to agree or disagree with me, but please if you disagree please explain what issues you have with either my post or the movie in general. Just because I think that TLJ is one of the best of the saga, doesn't mean that everyone else has to.

Here is An Explanation of Disney's Official Canon and Legends Material,"I see a lot of people confused about what is official canon in the Star Wars universe. Here is a simple explanation if you're interested. When Disney purchased Star Wars in 2014, they re-defined canon. They created the Lucasfilm Story Group which is responsible for making sure all material follows suit with continuity. The current list of canon is as follows (forgive me if I miss something):

-The Episodic Films (1-9)
-The Star Wars Story Films (Rogue One &amp; Solo)
-Star Wars: The Clone Wars Animated Film
-Star Wars: The Clone Wars Animated TV Show
-Star Wars: Rebels Animated TV Show
-Star Wars: Forces of Destiny Animated Miniseries
-Star Wars: Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir Comic
-Any comics, novels, reference material, and video games produced after Disney's purchase of the rights to Star Wars. This includes an enormous amount of material.
-[Here](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_canon_media) is the full list of canon materials. (I recommend viewing on a computer or laptop for the best display.)

All of this canon, is a part of the same universe. There is not ""film canon,"" ""TV canon,"" ""comic canon,"" and ""novel canon"" for example. They are all one contiguous canon.

There are special cases that are worth mentioning. Novelizations of the films are considered to be canonical, but ONLY the parts that are actually viewable on screen in the movies. Hence, it is easiest to just consider them non-canon for the sake of simplicity. Anything written in a novelization that is not specifically viewable in the film is not technically canon. That information comes straight from the Lucasfilm Story Group.

Any material that was created BEFORE Disney purchased Star Wars (other than items that made it onto the list above) was thrown into the category of ""Legends."" Stories that fall under legends, like Knights of the Old Republic, the Thrawn trilogy, the 2003 Clone Wars miniseries, etc. are not considered to be canon, but information from their content can be retroactively taken and placed into the canon at any time. Some characters and plot lines have been taken from legends material, and added to canon material. One example of this is the inclusion of Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars: Rebels. This character was created in a legends novel from years ago, but was beloved and so he was given a place in the contiguous canon.

I think that is about it. If anyone has any questions about anything, I'd be happy to discuss. And I would just say that, while it is really nice to have an official canon with really solid continuity, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy legends materials. My favorite content in the entire Star Wars universe is the Darth Bane trilogy, which is entirely legends. Hope this information was helpful!",StarWars,True,1514931497,2018-01-02

Something I noticed about the New Trilogy character arcs [Spoiler],"Not sure if anyone else has made this observation yet, but I thought it was something really cool in terms of the writing of the main three characters. I noticed after watching TLJ that the character arcs of the main three characters (Rey, Poe and Finn) follow the same arcs as the three main characters in the OT (Luke, Leia and Han) but in completely different ways. 

Poe is following Leia's arc, the born leader. The difference being that Leia was good at being a leader, while Poe is reckless and makes poor decisions as a leader.

Finn is following Han's arc of doing everything for themselves but eventually joins the bigger cause for reasons bigger than himself. The difference being that Han was being selfish because he was greedy, while Finn was being selfish because he was a coward.

Rey is following Luke's arc of being found by the force to become a Jedi master, but the difference is Luke was the center of the force, Rey is simply part of Kylo's journey, and not the focus at all.

"""Rey barely had any training"" - well...neither did Luke....","People have complained that Rey does a lot with the force while having very little instruction or training. But what this ignores is that Luke shows similar growth without the benefit of a teacher.


While Luke does get a very small amount of onscreen instruction from Obi-Wan and Yoda, most of Luke's development in the first happens offscreen in the timeskips between movies, when as far as we know he didn't have anyone training him at all.


-In A New Hope, Obi-Wan tells Luke about the force, gives him one 2 minute training session with a droid, tells him to ""use the force"" when he's on the death star run...and that is *it*. Yet in Empire Strikes Back, Luke is using telekinesis to pull the saber to himself long before he ever meets Yoda. How did Luke learn to do this? Obi-Wan never taught him. Hell, Obi-wan never even used that power in ANH. And we know he hasn't met Yoda yet, nor does Luke have any other Jedi to learn from. The clear implication is that Luke effectively learned this on his own. 

-Later in Empire, Luke does learn from Yoda for somewhere between a few days and a couple weeks (the timeline is unclear, though it can't be that long because its all happening while Han is running from the Empire). We see him learn to lift rocks, use the force to improve his jumping ability, and confront a dark vision of himself in the cave. Yet when he leaves to fight Vader, Yoda tells him he's not ready and still needs to finish his training. Luke goes to fight Vader and turns out to be totally unready and gets his hand chopped off. He barely survives.


-Yet when RotJ picks up, Luke has once again taken a huge leap in his command of the force between movies. He's  built himself a lightsaber, he can use advanced powers like force choke and mind tricks, and when he has his rematch with Vader he defeats him.


*None of this is ever explained at any point*. Luke literally goes from half-trained novice nearly dying in cloud city after like 2 weeks of force bootcamp, to being a full blown Jedi who can build a lightsaber, use all sorts of force powers, and beat Vader directly...all offscreen, and without any explanation of how he learned to do any of this. Did he learn from Yoda? Based on their last conversation, it doesn't seem like it. But no other teacher is ever mentioned. Its just understood and accepted that somehow, despite the Jedi being supposedly wiped out, Luke learned everything he needed on his own to become a full jedi.


I know the prequels presented being a Jedi as sort of like becoming a wizard in harry potter, as this thing you need to go to special school for years in order to master. But if you look at Luke's journey in the OT, he spends like 1 day learning from Obi-Wan, maybe 2 weeks learning from Yoda, and then the vast, vast majority of his development happens offscreen and is totally unexplained. Each time he appears in a new movie he has grown in the force and developed new powers, with no mention of any teacher having instructed him in these abilities.


The clear implication of Luke's development is that the force is *not* something you have to go to school for years to learn about, nor is growing in the force something that can only happen under a teacher. The force is something even a relative novice can practice on their own and develop abilities in (just as Luke apparently taught himself force pull between ANH and ESB despite never learning it from Obi-Wan), and for someone really strong in the force like Luke they can basically become a full blown Jedi--including building their own lightsaber--without anyone showing them how. Luke goes from losing to Vader to beating him without even receiving any additional training whatsoever as far as we know.


So when people complain about Rey not having much training, I have to wonder if they're being really influenced by the prequels' take on the force. Because watching Luke's development in the OT, most development in the force seems like it can be self-taught and you don't actually need a teacher.


**TL;DR Luke basically teaches himself the force in the offscreen timeskips between ANH and ESB, and between ESB and ROTJ, so developing strong force powers with little or no training is not in any way new for Star Wars**

"If George Lucas ever lets Lucasfilm release the unaltered OT in HD, here’s how I think they’d do it","Quick note, I think he would try to discourage casual fans from buying it, by doing something similar to what I thought of. I think they’d release a box set with every edition of the films ever made, but with only the unaltered version and already HD versions available in HD. However, each movie gets its own box set.

Example: A New Hope box set with all editions. Empire Strikes Back box set with all editions.

They might even make a new special edition that keeps changed that people like, and gets rid of changes that are hated. (I think there’s a fan edit like that)
This would give fans what they want, but make Lucas film more money, and George Lucas gets to try to discourage people from buying it by making it as expensive as possible, although it probably wouldn’t stop most of the people here.

"A Completely Unexpected Ending for IX - Rey Dies, Large scale battle on and above Coruscant","First, this is not a theory or anything I think that even has the slightest chance of happening. I’ve been trying to come up with ways that episode IX can end without essentially rehashing VI (redemption) or VII (rey beats Kylo AGAIN) and this was the one I got the furthest along in conceptualizing. This is also only the ENDING of the movie, not an entire outline. Some background or context, I guess.


There’s been a huge time-jump. Let’s say 8-10 years ideally. Rather than start an academy, Rey has taken on a single apprentice, who for Toys purposes, let’s say is Broom Kid - though in my Fanfic, we get a young Twi-lek girl who uses two sabers as a ;) to the audience. Kylo has taken full control in the galaxy and re-called his Knights of Ren whom Snoke had exiled. Ren rules from Coruscant which the FO has made their home base and capital. NO MORE PLANET KILLERS. The Resistance, led by Poe, has taken on more of a look similar to the original Rebellion. IE) mixing with unsavory characters. Regardless, they’ve built up one heck of an army made from Chiss, Mandalorians, Twi-leks, etc etc. They have a sizable fleet, resembling one prepared for battle rather than a guerilla rebellion. They’ve done all this in the outer rim and unknown regions while using smuggling routes to build their forces - Kylo hates smugglers and the Resistance uses this.


Anyway, I have two main things that I want to see: 1) Rey Dies and 2) There’s an unparalleled 3-level battle (Reylo/Space/Ground) on Courscant using a lot of the same cinematographic skills/techniques used in Rogue One but on larger scales.


In the “throne room” aboard some FO ship, Rey and Kylo battle but Kylo defeats her, taunting her that there is no wookie or anything else to save her. After defeating Rey, a report from the ground informs him that they have been pushed back closer to *Insert Important Location*. Kylo questions Hux who says his hands are full in the skies though he is confident they still have the upper hand. Kylo gets in his ship and breaks for the ground.


General Poe Dameron sees Ren’s ship and has a quick realization of what that means (they knew Rey was confronting him). He informs Admiral Tico (please make Rose cool) that Ren is going to the ground and that he has to stop him. Rose, being the sensitive soul that she is pauses at the realization that Rey is dead and things are about to get even more messy. She clutches her necklace, “For the ones we love, General Dameron. I’ll cover”. 


Poe dives after Ren while Rose wipes out a handful of pursuing fighters before returning to the main space battle aiding General Syndulla. 


Ren and Poe have a spectacular dog fight in the air above the city while Finn, BroomKid*, and whoever (MAZ!) lead massive ground assaults. Despite Poe’s talents as a pilot, Ren has the slight edge and is able to get him in his scope, beginning to lock. Just before, a familiar sounding turret fires as Chewie swings by in the Falcon damaging Ren’s ship. His collides with Poe’s sending them both to the ground somehow not exploding because of Plot Armor.


Ren, hobbled but alive gets out of his ship and starts hacking away still lethal as hell, a la Stannis in the woods outside Winterfell. Ren engages Broomkid with a light saber while Poe tries to help with a blaster. Ren, fights hard but the two heroes gain the upper hand. Broomkid has Ren lined up like Anakin with Dooku while Kylo taunts him about giving into his rage, etc. Before he gets a chance to make his final decision, a blaster goes off and Kylo falls dead. 


Finn - whose comms died during the battle leading everyone to presume his death - pops up in the background with a blaster. “I never liked that guy”


In *IMPORTANT LOCATION* there is some master Nuclear switch that activates some mega warhead inside all the star destroyers, dreadnaughts, etc. The majority of the FO fleet is knocked out, Ren and Hux are dead.

Shouldn’t the most logical choice for a trilogy be a trilogy about Darth Vader?,[deleted],StarWars,True,1514939628,2018-01-02
[SPOILERS] TLJ - I just realized something about Luke and his intentions after seeing Leia.,"We see that Luke has reconsidered his earlier stance. He kneels at the rock, reconnected to The Force, and seeks his sister Leia. Upon waking Leia, whose own strong connection to The Force has just saved her life, he then quickly rushes to Rey’s hut. 

He comes down in a big hurry, with an excited ""Rey!""

It is my belief that the Luke we see running down the hillside excitedly is a Luke who will now announce to Rey that he wants to accompany her and join the struggle against The First Order. 

I noticed this during my recent rewatch, and it seems clear as could be to me. That was a sense which I cannot justify except in his behaviors just prior opening the door and realizing that Rey is communing with Kylo Ren. I believe this realization has jilted Luke away from his new momentary intentions to join Leia.

I think that if the immediately subsequent events had not happened, that he would have joined Rey with the Resistance. I do not think he would have supported her going to Snoke's ship, but instead would have gone to support Leia.

We have seen many claims that parts of Luke's X-Wing make up the door of his hut. I don't think his X-Wing would have flown after he raised it from the water.",StarWars,True,1514939655,2018-01-02

[Potential Spoilers] Force Awakens dream sequence.,"Okay so I’m rewatching TFA after seeing TLJ, has anyone got any further ideas on the dream sequence which occurs when Rey touches Luke’s lightsaber for the first time?

[spoilers] What I think is bothering me about TLJ,"Spoilers for TLJ and TFA, obviously.

.
.
.

Overall, I liked TLJ, but I think the one thing that's bothering me about it is how in a way it invalidates the struggles of our favorite characters from the OT.

Our plucky rebels struggled for three movies to defeat evil and restore peace and justice to the galaxy. At the end of RotJ, they have succeeded - or at any rate it is implied that success will follow shortly, and according to the backstory of the new movies, it did.

Then 30 years later everything is COMPLETELY undone. By the end of TFA it's still ambiguous as to just how big a threat the First Order is, but given the opening crawl of TLJ, it's clear that the Empire has effectively popped back into existence, in some ways relatively stronger than ever since the Rebellion now consists of a few dozen people.

So effectively, Luke, Leia, and Han bought 30 years for the galaxy to bicker internally before plunging back into tyranny. Even if Poe/Finn/Rey beat the FO, it won't feel like a meaningful victory since they're just doing the same thing that the OT characters did - which turned out to change nothing in the long term. This makes the theme of the OT ""your sacrifice for something better is futile because your victory is temporary at best and you're screwed in the long run.""

I don't think this is the message that the directors intended, but it's definitely the one that's there.

I like a lot of things about the new trilogy. I didn't like that TFA re-hashed a movie I'd seen 38 years prior, but did like the characters a lot. I really like the way TLJ turned a lot of tropes and expectations completely on their heads. A number of people have been talking about how Star Wars has to evolve, and I agree. If it can evolve beyond the constraints of comic-booky adventure movies, all the better.

However, it's still an additional chapter of a larger story, and it just feels like the directors retroactively made the theme of the OT into the futility of struggle and sacrifice. I am aware that this happens a lot in real life, and an addition of realism into the SW universe isn't a bad thing. I just wish they'd kept this one particular aspect of idealism.",StarWars,True,1514940679,2018-01-02
[Spoiler] Question/Comment about the Jedi Texts,"When the trailer first came out for TLJ, I nearly lost it when I saw the Jedi Texts with a light beaming down on them. I am a huge fan of giving ancient/historical gravitas and weight to a story. Anytime I hear, ""A thousand years ago, there was a......"", I'm all in. Kind of like JJ's mystery boxes, except with less open-ended questions, and more answers that are peeled back over the course of the movie/book.

Anyways - what the f*&amp;! was the point of teasing them in TLJ, if they are only (MAYBE) going to have an impact in Ep. 9. All it would've taken would have been 2 lines of dialog from Luke like, ""The texts tell us that many years ago, there was a Jedi named....."" or ""a sith lord once....."" - whatever - just give me some effin' backstory. 

There was such a great opportunity to use the texts to tie together the old with the new. Give Rey some context about the Force and the Jedi. Give the fans something to lose their mind over, like Luke mentioning Darth Bane, or Mace Windu, or the Old Republic, etc. 

So frustrating. I actually liked TLJ, but there were so many missed opportunities. Even 2 lines of dialog from Snoke could've opened up comics or games to talk about his backstory. ",StarWars,True,1514941161,2018-01-02

Snoke is a Sith Lord.,"
I think Snoke is most likely a Sith based only on Ben Solo's line: 

""It's time to let old things die: **Snoke**, Skywalker, **the Sith**, the Jedi, the Rebels; let it all die."" 


Why would he bring up the Sith if Snoke wasn't a Sith?
I have no other evidence for this so I could definitely be wrong. I don't have an issue with Snoke's backstory going unexplained, but I thought this line was interesting.

[Spoiler] Something I noticed in TLJ the 2nd time around....,"In the beginning of the movie, when Kylo is about to fire on the ship that Leia is on, the camera fades back and forth between them the same exact way it did between Vader and Luke when they say ""Father"" and ""Son"" to each other in Empire.

Is this a force connection similar to what was used when Rey and Kylo speak to each other later on? If so, why doesn't Kylo acknowledge this? He acts like he's never experienced it before. I know Snoke set the latter up, but it seems similar to the interaction he had with his mother earlier and like what Luke had with Vader. Kylo and Leia don't speak, but it seems like we are meant to draw parallels between that scene and the one in Empire.

"TFA had a crappy plot but good execution, TLJ had a good plot but bad execution.","TFA did alot of things well in my opinion. the jokes were for the most part well contained and unobtrusive, and the main characters were interesting and believable. however, the plot of the movie was disappointing seeing as it was a shameless rehash of the OT (i.e. rebels vs empire take 2, death star take 3, snoke/palp).

However, TLJ imo suffers from the opposite problem. although the plot is interesting on paper and much more original (though it does borrow from ESB and RoTJ) the execution was very lackluster. The theme of failure fails to have any impact seeing as we see no real repercussion. Fin and Poe are basically war criminals but they just laugh it off while poe gets a promotion. Furthermore, the excessive jokes really killed the tension/tone of alot of scenes. its difficult to care about our characters or their situations when they dont seem to care about them either because they are cracking one liners. (the theme of hope is so poorly done im just gonna say that anyone can be a jedi, its always been that way, and how is luke showing up for 5 minutes and dying more inspiring then the resistance taking down starkiller base or the dreadnought?)

The TLJ also tried to do something different with kylo and rey and the whole hubris of the jedi and all that, but that also fell flat. how is kylo any different then a sith? he uses the force for evil and wants total power. he is the same villain we've always had except hes conflicted, this sounds interesting at first but then you ask what is he conflicted about? he doesnt know if he wants to be bad or good. thats it. our villian and half protagonist is conflicted over using the force for evil or good. and while the movie tries to act like hes some tragic figure hes just a dude who murders people for his own gain. if he had some utilitarian motive it could have been interesting, but in the end hes just like any other bad guy only he has thought about turning good. 

TLDr: TFA was a rehash of the OT but had good dialogue, interesting characters, and a consistent tone. TLJ has an interesting plot but has an inconsistent tone due to excess and intrusive comedy and trying to make kylo a compelling villain while giving us no reason to believe he is at all.

"JJ clearly had answers in place the RJ decided to change in TLJ, (evidence in my post) please prove me wrong","ok lets get the obviousness ones out of the way - (Kylo ""what girl"" upon hearing about rey, implying he knew something about her) -(Lightsaber calling to Rey and force back vision) -(Han and Maz talking about rey ""whos the girl"" then cutaway)

and here are the ones that i have not seen mentioned

-Luke traveled to the first jedi temple we dont know why in TFA, however in TLJ we are told he went there to die. why would luke go to the island of the first jedi temple to die if he had cut himself off from the force? he originally must have had a different convincing reason to go there.

-Luke is dressed in jedi garb at the end of TFA, and then instantly changes it when rey gets there. thus he probably was intended to have a much different reaction to seeing rey and purpose for being there.

-Snoke wants to kill luke, but why? luke wants to die, hes been in hiding for years, why does snoke even care then. he knows luke helped turn kylo evil then went into exile, so why does he care about killing him?

- Rey says ""the force"" when kylo mentions it then starts going ham and wins the fight, i think she was originally meant to to have been trained by luke but somehow got abandoned on jakku, and her training was reawakened, if not she got powers form no where. 

- the screenplay of TFA it says that luke ""looks at rey. a kindness in his eyes, but theres something tortured too. he doesnt need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here, his look says it all."" this is directly from the screen play so i would love to hear how the original intent was was not changed, seeing lukes reaction in TLJ

So there it is, imo there are no satisfactory answers expect that the trilogy was originally supposed to be different. I dont care at all, i like that rey is a nobody and dont mind lukes arc. I do however think it is very obvious that JJ had intended much different things for luke and rey that were changed in TLJ",StarWars,True,1514946065,2018-01-02

To those who think force use is unlimited.,"well this more applies to fanfiction writers  i am one of which) who seem to think the force allows for unlimited power, stamina and long life. in reality the force is all of this, however there is the danger of over using the force. this is what happened to luke after using the astral projection force illusion from who knows how far away. considering luke is on par with a his father in midichlorian count (ya ya the runed star wars) the effort killed luke after the falcon escaped.

so yes the force is a source of infinite power and users tend to live a long, long time =) over using it can be fatal.

Luke Was The LEAST Of The Problems,"If you even want to argue he's one at all.

What *was* a problem?

- Leia should've died. It was a beautiful death that they robbed of her and the audience. It would've been meaningful that, even though Ben couldn't actively kill his mother, his allegiance still passively allowed it. Her death could've slowly impacted Ben's character. Instead, there's no pay-off for anyone. And now she can't film an on-screen farewell of any kind.

- Who the FUCK is Snoke?! Did they honestly go, ""the character was never developed, and no backstory is going to be a good one, so just kill him off and never explain it""? He was really just a Mcguffin for 1 and a 1/2 movies!? After being the impetus for all of this, he's defeated and disregarded so easily?

- And how is everyone just Force-flying around/-floating each other around? I could accept Ray having repressed memories of having been taught some basic concepts as a child and just naturally growing on Jakku. And Snoke could've been explained if they had even remotely written a character. But Leia has no right doing what she did. And none of them have any right being as powerful as they are. They've gone even beyond PT-levels of Force power.

- Force projections? Ok. But don't be lazy about it! They just gave a whole new meaning to ""Forced exposition."" Good thing that Force-sensitive characters will never again need to have a reason to be together, even in galaxies far far away, huh?

- The entire Canto Bight sequence could be removed without affecting the plot. At all. Oh, except the Resistance wouldn't have suffered as many losses (thanks for the recommendation, all-seeing Maz!) Easiest payday del Toro's ever had, though, I'm sure, so good for him.

- Rose shouldn't have stopped Finn (or even been able to catch up to him). Again, the audience is cheated of a meaningful payoff. Rose as a character doesn't deserve to recover.

- There's nowhere for the story to go if we don't time-jump, like, a decade into the future. There are no short-term goals. Rebuild the rebellion from scratch? Sure! Be right back!

- Maz on holo, BB-8 on an AT-ST, and Luke in bullet time are some  of the dumbest things I've seen in Star Wars.",StarWars,True,1514952885,2018-01-02

I am not sure what to make of this. I haven't seen any attempt of an explanation and until it happens then this development is the very definition of retcon. The good news is now Rey isn't the only one who used the force without any training makes the character far more plausible. That one little scene made the new trilogy more about the force awakening and less ""the mary sue awakens"".

So... is this hinting at a future of star wars full of independent users without allegiance to the jedi or sith or any other order?

"The hatred of fans, and why I disagree (and I have found some other big fans that are with me)","Saw second time today. Results :

Interesting that some people/fans hate the new Star Wars. Some complaints, and why they are invalid or not important.

1. We didn't find out history of Snoke. Well yeah, and when original Star Wars came out nobody whined about not knowing history of the emperor. He was a really strong bad guy, with crazy power. That was it, the antagonist.

2. No history of Rey/bad history. Again, she is the protagonist and nobody cared that much about Luke's history in original/episode 4. The mistake was them making a big deal about it, but then I love that they say ""hey looky there, your history has nothing to do with who you are""

3. Why kill Luke and Snoke? Same as Kylo Ren said, to kill history. Stop caring so much about the history of SW and think about the future. Luke died same as Obi-Wan, too save those who could really fight. 

4. Poe is to hard to understand, doesn't make sense. That is the point, he is a character similar to Han. Not black and white, a little grey because he is young and has a big ego. Hard to control.

5. Not enough Phasma. I agree, certainly doesn't ruin a movie. I am going with my hope after episode 7, she plays bigger role in 9. There is no way she is dead. Also sad to hear so much of that interaction was on cutting room floor.

6. Don't know what happened to those who joined Kylo. Nope, we don't. Not yet. And again that is history, so it might never be explained. Think about Clone Wars mentioned in Episode 4, we had no idea what that was and didn't really care.


I think the point of the whole movie is that history isn't important. Stop caring so much about it. Stop with conspiracy theories. It doesn't matter if Snoke is Rey's cousin's uncle's father's roommate's husband's brother. He is the evil bad antagonist to fight. 


I think Kylo was the perfect example of Sith. Once he was strong enough he killed his master and took an apprentice (at least tried). I liked it the first time, and even more the second time.",StarWars,True,1514953567,2018-01-02

/s [SPOILERS] My edit of The Last Jedi,"Hey everybody!

Firstly, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johnson's version of the Last Jedi, enough to see it three times ha. The film isn't perfect by any means, but I didn't have any of the vitriol some other Star Wars fans have been having with the film since it came out. Being a writer and a storyteller myself, I did have some thoughts of how I would change the story to make it more of my own vision. So, bearing in mind what Rian Johnson were presented with, here is what I would personally change or fix about The Last Jedi.

- The beginning bombing sequence is very fun, but establishment of major characters during this sequence could have been done better. I would have liked to add a scene of the rebels prepping to fly off against the Dreadnaught. Poe can be his dashing fun self and jump into his black X-Wing with BB-8. After a small segment with Poe, we set up a small scene between Rose and her sister Page. In The Last Jedi, we only know of Page and Rose’s sibling relationship because of a weird medallion that is never fully explained, and you can include that in this scene if you want to bring the two of them together by material means, but I felt we needed to see the two interact together. The scene could maybe consist of Page, the older sister, laughing about how she will definitely return after the attack in a cocky, (almost Han Solo) type of way, and Rose can be the more humble of the two and is more concerned that the Resistance just won a huge battle against Starkiller base and that she feels they need to focus on running. The two part on hopeful terms but this ends up being self fulfilling when Page eventually sacrifices herself in the attack. Rose is understandably distraught and vows to do whatever she can to avenge her sisters death.

- The First Order chase sequence / fuel shortage / tracking through hyperspace can occur as written, however I would have added a sequence where Admiral Ackbar, Holdo, Leia, and maybe a few other important leaders of the Resistance can have a scene where they think they are safe and begin to formulate a new plan for a new Resistance base. Not only does this give more screen time to a fantastic Laura Dern, but also gives Ackbar another scene to be Ackbar before, inevitably, the First Order somehow has found them.

- We can have our Kylo Ren scene where he hesitates before firing, however the two Tie fighters still blast torpedoes at the bridge. Having Leia notice him through the Force can occur, but instead of the bridge being utterly destroyed, it is just heavily damaged. The main view port of the bridge is beginning to weaken, threatening all of the injured on the bridge to be blown into the vacuum of space. Holdo and Ackbar are pinned under some broken panels of the ship. Leia is miraculously unharmed, but is cut off from the main entrance to the bridge, which is the means for her own escape. As the view screen begins to crack and weaken more, Leia, in a last ditch heroic effort to save her friends, uses the force to lift the wreckage off of Ackbar and Holdo, allowing them to escape. She shares a last, loving and longing look at Holdo, Ackbar, and maybe even Poe, before the view screen breaks and launches her into space, giving Leia the type of heroes end that she deserved. Holdo, Ackbar, and the remaining bridge crew go to a secondary meeting room to discuss their options/next move.

- Finn awakens at this point and is confronted with worrying feelings about Rey. His interaction with Poe can be fully clothed and somber, as Poe is distraught over Leia’s death. Wanting to do his part, Finn joins the remaining leaders of the Resistance in Ackbar and Holdo as they discuss their next move. Here is where we can have a few of my films main changes play out.

- The First Order can track the Resistance ships through hyperspace via a tracking device aboard one of the Resistance ships. The main task for Finn/Rose/Poe is investigating the Resistances remaining ships to find the tracking device instead of the Canto Bight sequence, which we can all agree was garbage. It streamlines and simplifies the movies many threads and gives it more focus.

- The Resistance ships are faster and lighter, so they can stay out of range of the large guns of the First Order ships, but not for very long.

- To harass the Resistance ships, the First Order can launch a few fighter squadrons that the Resistance have to try and defend against with very few remaining fighter ships of their own. This is where we can have Poe really come into his own as a leader, which will inevitably help set up his eventual command of the Resistance in Episode 9.

- Finn, because of his knowledge of First Order technology, is the main “codebreaker” who can identify what the device looks like. While Finn can find the tracker, he doesn’t know how to disable it. This is where Rose volunteers and with some computer slicing magic, finds the location of the tracker.

- The tracker is stationed in a very heavily damaged part of the main ship and she doesn’t quite know how to get to it. This is where we can have Benicio Del Toro’s character in DJ, who in my version is another mechanic with a drug problem instead of a weird stuttering dude who’s in prison, come in and also volunteer to help.

- Holdo and Ackbar then come up with a contingency plan to covertly sneak the personnel of the Resistance away from the cruisers, searching nearby star maps where they eventually find an old rebel base on the planet Craite.

- The rest of this portion of the story is Finn, Rose, and DJ move through harrowing parts of the half destroyed Resistance main ship to find the device and disable it. All the while Poe is primarily patrolling and fighting First Order ships in space, losing pilots on both sides until there is only a handful of Resistance craft left. They find the device after some dangerous maneuvering in heavily damaged portions of the ship, but also find that even if they destroy it, the resistance ships have expended enough of their fuel to not be able to jump to hyperspace. This leads to Holdo and Ackbar’s contingency taking effect.

- Ackbar decides to do the old sea captain “go down with the ship” and gives the reins of the Resistance leadership to Holdo. As a last ditch effort to mask the escape craft heading to Craite, Ackbar rams Snoke’s main cruiser and heavily damages it. We however know his sacrifice is somewhat for naught, as Hux notices the escape craft heading for Craite.

While all this is happening, the Rey/Luke storyline can play out somewhat similarly as it did in the original film, however with a few additions.

- Personally, one of the main problems that I have with Rey is that we never see her learn these skills, so when she finds the old Jedi texts, we have a scene or two of her studying ferociously over them. We can even have a scene where Luke berates her, only to have his own ideals at this time rebuked by the hope in Rey’s ideology. This leads to a very important scene that I felt was missing in the original film. After a moment with master Yoda, who at this point can have his speech about having hope in a new pupil, Luke takes out his old lightsaber and begins teaching Rey. A montage of her meditating on the rock/practicing her lightsaber techniques/as well as physical training can occur and parallel Luke’s own study with Yoda.

- The Rey/Kylo force connection can occur during this time and can remain pretty unchanged, however this is kept secret from Luke.

- There comes a point during her training the Luke finds out about the Rey/Kylo connection, and seeing as Rey is at Kylo’s level of power after just a few days of training, decides to stop training her.
This brings me to one of the biggest changes I would make for the film.

- Instead of Luke’s personal failure in thinking, even for a split second, that he’ll kill Ben Solo because of the dark side within him, which in my version will come a little later, he instead fails at seeing the progress and eventual complete corruption of Kylo by Snoke. It begins as a montage of the viewers seeing Kylo Ren go from a young, happy student, to using finding he is more powerful then the other students and becomes arrogant. His anger begins to grow through Snoke’s manipulation, and eventually leads him to using this dark side power to beat some of Luke’s other pupils in Lightsaber training.

- There can even be a scene of him hurting another student badly, and this is where Luke realizes and sees Kylo revel in his abuse of power. This is where Luke, just like in the film, begins to covertly investigate Kylo. He eventually looks deep enough into the force to sense the incredible dark side power, (who is really Snoke and his influence), within Kylo. He has the moment of failure when he turns on the lightsaber to kill Kylo in his sleep, and it gives Kylo the final nudge he needs after all of the manipulating by Snoke to turn against the Jedi and destroy it.

- Rey and Luke can have their confrontation that resolves in Rey being disillusioned with Luke. She ultimately believes that Kylo can be turned back to the light side, and goes off to confront him and Smoke. Luke stays behind, defeated that he has once again failed another one of his pupils. In that moment of defeat, Luke goes to destroy the Jedi tree and the texts. He has his encounter with Yoda and the rest of the island story can occur as in the original film.

- The Rey/Kylo/Snoke arc can remain largely unchanged. Snoke can die by Kylo’s hand and Kylo can become the new Supreme Leader of the First Order. Hux informs Kylo of the resistance retreat to Craite and the Hothesque battle can occur, with a few minor changes.
Holdo is the one leading the Resistance, and tells them to set up what little defenses they can for a last stand.

- Instead of the weird skiffs the resistance use, they instead use junky Snowspeeders. Because Parallels!

- Rose is the one to go on the suicide run of the large First Order laser weapon instead of Finn. Finn is the one to save her, but instead of their forced romance, he just drags her unconscious body back to the old Rebel base. Before he can get there, Captain Phasma and a bunch of stormtroopers surround and capture them, and this is where we leave Finn and Rose’s characters until Episode 9.

- The ending of the film is relatively unchanged, save for a small scene where Rey, the Last Jedi, meets Holdo and Poe for the first time. When wondering about Finn, Poe can say he saw them being taken away by the First Order. In this last scene we can have a final Force conversation with Rey and Kylo. The new Supreme Leader boasts that he will take everything Rey cares about from her, just like everything was taken away from him by Luke as a boy. We see him finally take in and succumb to all of the anger and hatred that fuels his power in the dark side, and this manifests itself in his eyes transforming into those of a Sith Lord. He cuts off their connection by telling Rey that she will be the last Jedi he is to kill before he takes over the galaxy. Rey, having gone through a tremendous amount of personal growth, is unafraid of Kylo’s threats. She tells him she trusts in the force, and that it will guide her to the light. She says she pities him, and that they will meet for a final time soon. Then, as Rey boards the Millennium Falcon, she senses something behind her. Luke, in his force ghost form, gives her a smile and a nod before disappearing. The Falcon soars into the atmosphere of Craite before jumping to lightspeed.

"The nature of Star Wars ""fans""","Seeing all then negativity flying around the SW fanbase currently, I'm sick of people dictating to others how someone's supposed to be a Star Wars fan. Whether it's:

1. You have to like all the films or else you're not a ""true"" fan. 
2. You have to dislike a certain subset of films (@prequels) because they're not ""good.""
3. You have to hate/love the new films (depending on POV). 

This shit is MEANINGLESS.

Here's where I stand on Star Wars. I lean towards the original trilogy. The prequels, while I grew up with them and they introduced me to my favorite franchise, they're so incredibly mishandled as films that it's hard for me to enjoy them. Yes, even Episode III. As for the new films, I love TFA, I like Rogue One, and I think TLJ is definitely messy, but has some really amazing shit in it (I'm still deciding where exactly I stand on it).
As of right now, here's how I rank the films.

1. The Empire Strikes Back
2. A New Hope
3. The Force Awakens
4. The Last Jedi
5. Return of the Jedi
6. Rogue One
7. Revenge of the Sith
8. The Phantom Menace
9. Attack of the Clones

You know what's amazing about all of this? My opinions mean jack shit to you. If the prequels are your favorite films, then all power to you. If you despise Disney's new Star Wars, then that's fine. I know it's the internet, but all this silly fighting about how someone needs to act to be a Star Wars fan, or the constant attacking of people's opinions about SW is ridiculous. I'm guilty of it myself; I can get caught up in the way that I love Star Wars, that I can fail to recognize or respect that someone else has a different POV. If you love Star Wars in some capacity, you're a SW fan in my book. My personal beliefs about what Star Wars should be may differ from what you think Star Wars should be, but that's okay.

We all love our galaxy far, far away, and we should be able to love it the way we want to love it.

About half-way through the Phasma novel. It's a real shame she hasn't gotten more screen time in the films.,"As someone who reads all of the canon novels (with the exception of some of the junior novels), I just cannot stress enough how great ""Phasma"" is so far.  I'm not going to go into any real detail because I'd prefer to keep this spoiler free both for the novel and for it's connections to The Last Jedi (of which there are a small few) but, not only is her character intriguing, but the way in which the story is told is thrilling.  There is a certain layer of complexity to her that exists in other Star Wars characters such as Kylo Ren.  While Kylo Ren, Rey, and others' complexities are on display in the films, Captain Phasma is almost entirely devoid of any character building.  This novel changes that.  I find myself more and more eager to finish this book so I can look on the character with a new light, one which the films would never allow me to achieve.  I guess I'd liken it to some of the other background characters in Star Wars that never had their due time on screen but were fully fleshed out in previous eras.  

  &amp;nbsp;  

There's also a bit of a Mad Max vibe to it, and as someone who has loved that franchise growing up, I'm thrilled to see that feel crossing over into other series.  While Bloodline remains my favorite novel by far (simply because of its level of intrigue, similar in feel to Attack of the Clones), Phasma is certainly a close second.  I went into this book not expecting much, which isn't necessarily a knock on the recent films, but simply because I make sure to temper my expectations before reading any novel, or seeing any film, so as to enjoy the story and where it takes me.  

  &amp;nbsp;  

Bottom line, if you get a chance to read this novel (I heard it was on sale at target for $15 in hardback, which is what I prefer), do not miss the opportunity.  I think a lot of people will get a very good idea of who Phasma is, and learn to appreciate her more in the brief moments we see her on screen.",StarWars,True,1514954560,2018-01-02

My favorite part of the audiobook version of Aftermath,"was the conversation between Oliver Twist and John Wayne (poor little kid and rebel pilot). I don't know how but I nearly made it through the whole book on my drive back home today. The production choices are odd (I do like that they put in music), and the narrator has really strange go-to accents for different characters. He definitely earned his paycheck with all the effort he put in, though.  
This was my first experience with a Star Wars book, and I really wanted to enjoy it, but there is way too much goofy stuff and terrible space creature metaphors for me to be too psyched about reading the next two books.

How does Rose feel about...,"Poe’s “fly-boy” mentality at the beginning of the film that Leia says resulted in too many dead heroes including  Rose’s sister, Paige Tico...who really could really be the movie’s greatest hero (gives Luke some serious competition lol).

Rose clearly is shown to be very sad, not angry at anything or anyone, but the fact that Leia and Holdo chew Poe out all movie about his actions...I feel like Rose would sort of be compelled to feel somewhat the same way...with the added weight of it being the reason why her sister died. But I do like the point that had the dreadnaught be taken out, it probably would’ve had the range to blow up the resistance which was sort of key in the literally linear chase plot.

Feel like Rose gets this and just uses Paige’s death as motivation throughout (which they make a point to show like 3-4 times)

Either way...interesting to think about.",StarWars,True,1514956112,2018-01-03
So I just saw TLJ and I really really enjoyed it but some points didn’t sit well with me,"Getting the positives out of the way, I absolutely loved everything for the first two hours or so of the movie. 
-The storyline with the rebels trying to escape the First Order was suspenseful the entire time and was simply a joy to watch. Finn’s part in the movie with the casino and Rose wasn’t quite as good but still very enjoyable. It’s just that Rose as a character didn’t sit well with me. I didn’t like her. But I did appreciate was Finn brought to the table and it was so much fun to watch him in the movie. 
-Rey and Luke was great. Much darker than I expected and that’s something I appreciated a lot, especially the twist when Luke was the one about to kill Ben.
-Now for the big one: Rey and Kylo. God damn I adored this storyline almost the entire way through. They’re relationship growing through the Force was fantastic and the whole idea of them both being on the edge of light and darkness was nail biting. Who would finally agree to switch sides?
-Lightspeed kamikaze
-The Kylo Ren and Rey fight with the guards was incredible. Best scene of the movie imo

This also leads me into my problems with the movie. 
-Why did Snoke die? Don’t get me wrong at the moment he died it was pulled off very well, because that marked Kylo switching sides and helping Rey, who was almost firmly in the Light side. NOPE. He just went complete Dark side and that really disappointed me. What was even the purpose of Snoke dying if Kylo went from Dark side to....Dark side just more.
-The “fight” with Luke. C’mon it was a hologram. Much less emotional impact and satisfaction at Kylo’s character if he was fooled by that.
-Phasma’s death
-Leia(bless her) didn’t really do anything the entire movie.
-So is Kylo Ren now the big bad? That’s kind of disappointing because I don’t see any other option aside from him to die in the next film. He can’t just switch sides anymore because he’s practically Snoke and Palpatine now. I guess the Skywalker storyline is over now? I had such high expectations for him too; he was the most interesting to me in the entire movie.

A concern I now have about the Han Solo character in his solo movie.,"So I was watching the most recent Collider Movie Talk and two of the panellists by the name of  [John Rocha and Perri Nemiroff had this to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3TmKEeBUMM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=22m38s).

Essentially the important part is at 22:45 till 24:45 minute mark. This made me think about how people have reacted to Luke in TLJ which is set 30+ years after RotJ and approx 5 - 6 years into his seclusion.

Now I actually like Luke's depiction in the TLJ and whilst I did want Luke to have some sort of display of power (akin to Vader in R1) I also understand we are coming into his story again somewhere in the end (We started in the beginning).

We could still get plenty of comics, books, video games and maybe a movie somewhere down the line between RotJ and the start of TFA to flesh his character out more and this already has started happening with the story campaign of EA BF2.

However with Han we came into his story half way through in ANH and the Solo movie is going to cover his formative/early years.

So I am open to seeing any depiction of Han as long as it makes sense leading into ANH. Stuff like Jabba, the dice, Chewie and depending on where the story ends Han's mannerisms.

The Last Jedi reminds me of The Phantom Menace,"The Force Awakens had some plot elements inspired by A New Hope. It also kindled a sense of awe and love of the Star Wars universe and left me wanting to see more. 

The Last Jedi was different in plot from The Phantom Menace, but it had a similar tone and feel. A kind of whimsical ""hey don't take this so seriously"" tack that appealed to a younger audience to get them invested in the Star Wars franchise. 

I really enjoyed TFA and had so much hope for the rest of the sequels. However,I just couldn't enjoy TLJ the same way, despite trying. TLJ struck the same foul chord with me that I felt when watching TPM. 

The juvenile humor distracted from the plot. 
Scenes with the new character (Rose) were mostly superfluous to the plot. 
Seemingly impossible nonsense distract from the plot

The basic point is I feel like TLJ took the wind out of my sails. I was left confused by the film and I'm much less excited to see what the next installment entails.

My TLJ sticking points,"Gotta say I liked it more on a second viewing. But there are still a few points that prevented me from really enjoying the movie:

* **Why did Holdo not simply tell Poe and the rest of the crew what her plan was?** As far as I can tell there was no reason it had to be kept a secret, at least that was stated or shown in the movie. And *so much* of the drama is built on this. It causes Poe to first question Holdo publicly, then secretly help Finn and Rose in their plan, and finally lead a mutiny against Holdo. At any of these points, she could have just informed him of the plan to reach the mineral planet, as Leia later did. Holdo is supposed to be a great leader who knows how to deal with ""flyboys,"" but she completely mismanages the situation. She seems more concerned with putting Poe in his place than accomplishing the mission, yet the movie wants her to come off as self-sacrificial. I don't get her motivation for keeping the plan secret at all.

* **Given that Holdo did not tell most of the crew what her plan was, how did ""DJ"" (Benicio del Toro's character) know what her plan was?** Finn and Rose never discuss it. Presumably it's not being transmitted from the main cruiser. Yet ""DJ"" somehow knows what the plan was and spills the beans to the First Order. As far as I can tell, there's no reason whatsoever that he should have this information.

* I still Rose's final words utterly cringe-inducing. (I've been informed that she actually survived the crash, but I still like to think of them as her final words.) Finn was, in fact, doing exactly what she said--saving what he loved. He was attacking a weapon that was going to kill his friends, *not* fighting people that he hated. And she *stopped him from doing that*, in a way that could easily have killed one or both of them.

I generally like the Luke stuff, the Rey and Kylo stuff (although I think it would work better if she was more tempted by the Dark), the humor's fine, the porgs are cute. But these pretty major plot, character, and theme failures make this my least favorite of the Disney movies.

P.S. Are those the Jedi texts in the drawer that Finn pulls out to get a blanket in the final Falcon scene? It was just a split second, but it sure looked like them.",StarWars,True,1514958614,2018-01-03

"(Spoilers) I know most people hated the Leia in space scene, but there was one part I really liked...","While I know that most people consider Leia flying in space the worst scene in Star Wars history, I really loved the music that John Williams provided here. When Leia is floating in space seemingly drained of all life, her theme is played quietly with a perfect mournful tone, the feeling evoked here seems completely hopeless. But as she shows signs of life, the feeling of hope slowly starts to slowly come back into her theme, and then as Leia uses all her power through the force to bring herself back to the ship, the song goes full swing and Leia's hope seems as powerful as ever.

While I know most people here believe that this scene ruined Star Wars, I just wanted to show my appreciation for the beauty John Williams was able to provide to a scene, even with its controversial content.

Born and raised on Coruscant the Agent was left with the choice between the Empire and the gangs of the Underworld. The show would follow his journey from an ISB Agent to a Rebel Double Agent.

I think I found a plot hole in TLJ,"So when I was watching the last Jedi with my friend I think I found a plot hole. So basically when they capture Finn and Rose on the “supremacy” as well as DJ and then he sells them out by saying that they are taking the small transports but how does he/Finn/Rose know this fact. The plan was for Finn and Rose to destroy the tracking thing then for the ship to warp away. Finn and Rose were never told about this plan and even if they did they never mentioned it to DJ as they told him that they needed a decoder. So all DJ knows is they want to destroy the tracking device and to warp to hyper space. Also Poe never told them about the change of plans last second when Leia gets back as he gets knocked out by her blaster, as well as Finn and Rose getting captured. So how does DJ know about the transport ships, and how is he able to sell them out?",StarWars,True,1514961030,2018-01-03

There's nothing wrong with the physics of the bomb drop sequence at the start if you assume the ships are more or less stationary (zero orbital velocity).

Is there a G-Canon (I-VI only) sub?,"I've been having a number of, ahem, *spirited discussions* on this sub since TLJ came out. I really disliked it for the same reasons that many others did. Since it's so polarizing, and since Star Wars matters to me as much as it does, I've felt compelled to argue my points.

I've read a number of sentiments to the effect that if you don't like TLJ or the direction Disney is taking the franchise in general, you should just leave and let others enjoy it. I don't entirely agree, but then again, I really don't begrudge others enjoying TLJ, and as much as I dislike and disagree with many of Rian Johnson's creative choices, I can at least intellectually understand why a different type of fan would like them.

It's probably not fun for those fans to be constantly on the defense. I remember when the PT was current, I felt like I was in the minority for enjoying them, and I adopted many of the same tactics defenders of TLJ are using today. It wasn't very fun for me, either.

Apart from *Rogue One*, I don't much care for what Disney has put out so far. I did like TFA in general, but that was a provisional position based on future films. It had more to do with its *potential* than its intrinsic merit. TLJ has retroactively soured me on TFA because of its wasted potential (again, from my perspective).

I don't pine for what is now called ""Legends."" I liked some of the old EU, but disregarded most of it. To me, Star Wars, pre- and post-Disney acquisition, is Episodes I-VI. What used to be known as ""G-Canon,"" essentially.

I'd prefer to spend my time on a subreddit that focuses on that, but I've been unable to find one. Does anyone know of one? If not, would anyone have any interest in the creation of such a sub? I just feel like I can't be the only fan who feels this way, and it might be best for those of us who still like Star Wars as it once was to form our own splinter fandom and leave the main fandom to people who are fine with the current direction of the franchise.",StarWars,True,1514962691,2018-01-03
[spoilers] My ideas on Luke’s moment of crisis,"The scene where Luke confronts Kylo for the first time is controversial, here is my take on it

A recap of the scene in The Last Jedi

Luke entered the tent and looked into to Ben’s heart to, at that time, find pure darkness and saw the danger he would cause, and Luke felt a short, instinctual, moment of temptation to kill Ben Solo and stop Kylo from killing everyone he cares about. This is similar to Vader in the “you have a twin sssssister” scene, anger for vengeance and fear for his friends safety made him lash out in both situations. Of course Luke stopped himself both times and stopped himself sooner with Ben than with Vader, (Kylo had all his hands after the confrontation). Luke became distraught and disgusted at himself for his fear reaction, gaining control over his thoughts again he tried to talk Ben down but Ben only saw danger and attacked

My theory is,

Dark side influence, it exists around strong users, in SWTOR Darth Jadus made those around him feel fear, sickness, and as if they would soon die, a “tainted influence” as he describes it. Darth Vader would bring dread into every room he enters, a crushing fear like no other. The saying goes “when one looks into the abyss, the abyss looks back” and when Luke looked into Ben Solo’s heart he was influenced by the darkness he felt and had his gut fear reaction to kill him to save the ones he loves (like father like son). But Luke had control enough to stop himself, but it was too late. Luke abandoned the life of a Jedi because he was ashamed of his weak moment and thought he wouldn’t be helpful anymore. 

Edit: Luke is flawed like all people, and he is only human, like his father he can have moments of weakness, he isn’t a divine God of justice. He is Luke the farm boy who has been through a lot.",StarWars,True,1514963259,2018-01-03

Does the force ghost ability make the light side stronger?,"This debate on which side is stronger is an old one I know but I was thinking about the force ghost ability. Now Yoda specifically says the dark side isn't stronger, it's just a quicker path to power. However Yoda may be biased in his thinking as he is a Jedi and does not want people to go to the Dark side. The final power of the dark side seems to be force lightning. The final power of the Jedi seems to be the force ghost possibility. We have seen force lightning be deflected and absorbed by powerful Jedi. We have also seen more force ghost capable Jedi than force lightning sith, however we have seen more Jedi than sith so theres that. 

 While force lightning may be more practical in the moment, force ghost seems a lot more useful. Especially now that we saw a force ghost use a physical power and not just training and guidance. Is the force balanced or do you guys think the light side is indeed stronger?

#**Plot:**

**ACT ONE**

Opening Scene: A group of X-Wings and Rebellion Flagships come out of Hyperspace, lead by Poe Dameron who orders his following X-Wings to disable the Finalizer so Rey and Finn and infiltrate the Star Destroyer and save Leia. After Kylo Ren enters his TIE Silencer to end the Rebellion’s plan, he is shot down by Poe and sent down to the planet below, Chandrila. Meanwhile Hux, who is on another Star Destroyer, orders TIE Pilots to destroy Poe’s ship, recognising him from D’Qar and Starkiller Base. Poe manages to destroy all TIE Fighters with the help of the support X-Wings and leads an attack onto the Finalizer. Finn and Rey, who has her staff equipped after not rebuilding her lightsaber, have started heading towards the Finalizer when it suddenly blows up because of a Rogue Pilot, killing Leia and all Stormtroopers on board.

Kylo Ren’s TIE Silencer crashes into a building in the middle of a city on Chandrila, where multiple Stormtroopers witness and rescue him from the ship, putting him in a Bacta Tank to recover, a new temporary leader is needed for the First Order. Jacen Caedus, Snoke’s secret second apprentice is chosen by Hux to lead the First Order until Kylo recovers. However Hux secretly wanted to manipulate Jacen so that he kills Kylo, then he will kill Jacen.

On the Rebel Flagship, A funeral for Leia is underway, with all members of the Rebellion minus Rey are present, who left after the ghost of Luke told her to return to Ahch-To to finish her training by building a lightsaber. Upon arrival in the Falcon, Chewbacca eats another Porg, and Rey follows a calling caused by Luke’s green Lightsaber, when she finds it, Luke appears and tells her to build her own lightsaber using the crystal. She combines the kyber crystals of both the Skywalker lightsaber and Luke’s lightsaber to forge a new lightsaber. She turns it on and reveals the blade to turn Yellow, as the mix of Blue and Green synced together to make it.

Having put a tracker on the Falcon all the way back on Starkiller Base, Hux and Jacen lead an assault onto Ahch-To to destroy the Island and kill Rey. Upon arrival, Chewie jumps into the Falcon and attempts to destroy incoming TIE Fighters. During the battle, the Falcon is destroyed and the First Order arrives on Crait with several TIE Fighters seeking out Rey. When alerted to the presence of the First Order, Rey is told by Luke to escape by using his old X-Wing that is in the oceans off the coast. As Stormtroopers siege the Island, Rey is assisted by a Sea Monster that grabs multiple stormtroopers and eating them. She finally finds the X-Wing and lifts it out of the water and repairs the broken wing that was used as Luke’s door. She then gets in the X-Wing, picks up Chewie and escapes into space. Phasma is revealed to be alive and tells Hux that Rey escaped.

**ACT TWO**

Kylo Ren gets out of the Bacta Tank, completely healed and learns of Jacen’s leadership. Upon meeting on Coruscant, Jacen says that he is now the leader of the First Order and that the Knights of Ren and the entire Military now belongs to him, this angers Kylo and they enter a duel, revealing Jacen’s Double Bladed Purple Lightsaber. After a long duel, Kylo is victorious after he pushes Jacen off the balcony of the Emperor’s Tower, where the dual took place. Kylo Ren then tells Hux to get his forces together and attack the Resistance fleet. Hux rejects and says he leads the First Order now and betrays Kylo.

Rey reunites with Finn, Rose and Poe aboard the Rebellion Fleet and discuss the next plan of action against the First Order. Rose suggests infiltrating the First Order headquarters on Coruscant so that they can learn what weapons and technology they have. Rey, Poe and C’ai Threnalli are chosen for the mission and are sent down to Coruscant. When Stormtroopers ask to inspect their ship, C’ai is the one to come out, when the Stormtroopers enter the ship, they do the good ol’ costume switch to go undercover.

Kylo Ren, who was apprehended by Stormtroopers due to “treason” is sent to the Coruscant prison when he senses Rey, he attacks the Stormtroopers and manages to free himself, going to hunt down Rey once more.

When Poe, Rey and C’ai successfully enter the First Order’s data vaults, they find plans to attack Tatooine and stop all crime there so that nothing can Opress the First Order, starting to leave, Kylo Den busts his way into the Data Vaults to find Rey, they narrowly escape but are caught when Poe’s helmet falls off while running. The Stormtroopers are already preoccupied with Kylo and thr three manage to escape and get back to the fleet.

**ACT THREE**

Now receiving the plans of the Tatooine attack, the Rebellion jumps to Tatooine, where they are attacked by Hux and his fighters. Poe and C’ai enter their X-Wings along with the rest of the pilots to fend them off, knowing of the ground attack, Rey, Chewie, Finn and the rest of the Resistance lands on Tatooine to fend off the First Order and destroy them, once and for all.

The X-Wings are mostly destroyed, including C’ai’s, so the rest of them retreat to Tatooine to join the ground battle. Upon landing, a massive shadow engulfs the Resistance landing area as Kylo Ren’s Command Shuttle arrives on the planet. On board the shuttle is Kylo Ren, The Knights of Ren and Captain Phasma, who defected from the First Order to join Kylo. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewie and Rose prepare to fight Kylo, Phasma and the Knights of Ren, Rey having her Lightsaber, Finn having the Baton from the Supemacy, Poe borrowing Rey’s staff, Rose using a modified version of her taser and Chewie just using his hands.

The two sides charge at each other, Rey takes on Kylo, Finn takes on Phasma and Rose, Chewie, and Poe take on the Knights of Ren. During a fight, Rey gets knocked across the battlefield by Kylo and lands near Phasma, who she stabs then charges back at Kylo. Chewie rips the arms off of two Knights of Ren, Poe manages to disarm and defeat one knight, while Rose is defeated by one, the Knights then start to overpower the five, but are saved when gunshots are heard, killing all Knights of Ren, including Kylo. The shots came from Stormtroopers who started bombarding the dunes. Just before Kylo dies, about a 2 minute interaction is given between him and Rey, he tells her that the Skywalker Bloodline is no more and Snoke is Darth Plagueis, the master of the Emperor.

The Rebellion takes notice of the Stormtroopers and starts attacking. Just as AT-M6’s are deployed onto the sand, several ships fly in and disable them, revealing themselves to the the Resistance Allies teased at in The Last Jedi. They knew where to go as Finn had earlier sent a distress call saying that it is now or never if they want to destroy the First Order and that this will be The Last Hope. Hux sees this and decides to deal with the matter himself, claiming that if he kills Rey, The Last Jedi, nothing will stand in his way. Hux approaches Rey and equips a Stormtrooper Baton. Rey quickly disarms Hux, who is suddenly lifted into the air and choked to death by a mysterious warrior, Jacen Caedus who survived his duel with Kylo. Rey sees Jacen and immediately starts attacking him, who easily defeats her, but a bombardment of blaster fire from the Rebellion distracts him enough that Rey manages to sneak up behind him and impale him with her lightsaber.

Now without a leader, the First Order charges into battle against the Rebellion and Resistance. Multiple X-Wings are shown destroying TIE Fighters. The battle ends after a long battle agains the remaining Stormtroopers when all their forces are depleted. There are mass casualties on both sides. Rose, Poe and many Rebellion fighters are killed and almost all Stormtroopers are as well, with the remaining taken prisoner on Coruscant.

The War is over and the overtaken systems are soon cleansed by the Resistance. Rey meets with Luke again, who introduces her to Obi-Wan, Anakin and Yoda. Afterwards, Rey and Finn meet in the ruins of the old Jedi Temple and discuss what will happen next, the war is over, no more terror threatens the galaxy. The movie ends with both of them looking into the sunset on Coruscant.",StarWars,True,1514968732,2018-01-03

Kylo Ren theory from TFA confirmed?,"SPOILERS 

After seeing the force awakens I heard a theory that kylo Ren needed to kill Han so he could get close to Snoke, in order to kill him. He says to Han  “I know what I need to do but I don’t know if I have the strength, will you help me” he repeats this line partly just before he kills Snoke.  My first thought when I heard that, was the theory. 

So does this confirm that killing Snoke was always his intention? If so why is he still the bad guy if it was only an act to gain Snoke’s trust?

I wish this was explored more, the idea that kylo was planning a coup is more interesting than the way it happened.

Best Droid Army Idea(First Order Era): Would it work?,"The best droid army(not including navy)in my opinion would be heavily inspired by the CIS and the First Order. I'll give a list of the more widely used droids in this ""dream droid army"":

The standard battledroid would be the BY-series battledroid, which is a kind of droid I made up that is basically a BX-series Commando Droid, but smaller. This droid would be equipped with an F-11D blaster rifle, made to be a bit smaller and easier to attach to a droid, as well as two wrist rockets, and a small droid similar to the Buzz Droid, but designed for repair of battledroids and construction of temporary tactical structures(barriers, bridges, etc.) rather than tearing apart starfighters.

Then there is a slightly improved version of the DSD1 dwarf spider droid, with faster movement, a faster-firing and more powerful main gun, and improved accuracy. These would be used as small gun platforms really, as the versatility of its multi-mode weapon, and its accuracy make it perfect for use against enemy vehicles, and as a powerful rapid-fire weapon against infantry.

Then to the small scouting-type vehicles. I'll call them speederbots. They would be theoretical droids that are basically automated speederbikes with twin laser cannons, but with a large detachable explosive hidden underneath, allowing the speederbot to weaken enemy defenses before the main force arrives.

A common support vehicle would be a large cargo speeder with some explosive ammo for the vehicles and infantry, and with a large stash of materials for the Buzz droid-style repair droids to use in battlefield repairs and in the construction of makeshift bridges, barricades, and other strategic structures.

Now the mid-size hovertank. I would use an automated version of the republic Saber tank, allowing the blaster turret on top to not require an organic gunner. This automated tank would be much better than its piloted version, as the access hatch in the rear, one of the biggest weaknesses of the tank, would not be needed, leaving it with very little weaknesses. Paired with its impressive arsenal, and an on-board shield generator, this tank would be a force to be reckoned with.

As for the large walker, I would say that the AT-TE had a good design compared to the AT-AT, so a First Order-style overhaul to it would be warranted. Making its main top turret automated would solve the same issue as it did on the Saber; The exposed organic pilot. Then, making the thing waterproof and spaceproof are main priorities, as to make it able to be deployed in water-logged areas like swamps and even being deployable in space, one of the weaknesses in the AT-TE design. Then, an upgrade on the weapons and armor of the thing, giving it stronger guns, and some anti-air weapons, as well as some armor modernization, making the armor out of a slightly better metal. Some repair droids like the ones used by the infantry might also be good for battlefield repairs, and adding various small stashes of repair materials throughout the walker wouldn't be bad idea, either. Finally, adding a rack for deploying BY-series droids onto the battlefield should leave you with a versatile and powerful automated walker.

As for commanders, they would optimally be Jedi, as they have force abilities and rigid rules that can make them very tactically minded, as well as tactically beneficial. Not to mention lightsabers.
But, if Jedi are not available, then Sith or any particularly intelligent organic being is acceptable. Droids would make terrible commanders as they lack the creativity and will rarely match the intelligence of a capable organic officer. It also makes the army more relatable and less oppressive to the local populace, reducing the likelihood of revolt or resentment among the locals.

All droids would be connected to the nearest allied starship sending a droid control signal, which would be connected through a long string of starships to a main command center which transmits general orders and intelligence, as well as software updates for the droids.

I know this was a loooooooooooong post but I hope you can see my vision of the perfect droid army based in the era of the new trilogy. ",StarWars,True,1514983674,2018-01-03

Why the Sequel trilogy feels so empty and small and how it can be fixed.,"I realized that something has felt off about the sequel trilogy, and I realized that it does a stunningly low level of worldbuilding. Everything we've seen in these two movies is small and insignificant, like two toddlers fighting over a toy in a sandpit. There are no stakes, no bystanders, nothing to fight over.  
I don't want to start a fight over which trilogy is better, but for analysis sake let's compare the Prequel's worldbuilding and Sequel's worldbuilding.  
  
New Prequel Locations:  

* Naboo: A rich, lush world with two societies on chilly terms, with the Naboo living in a renaissance style city complete with living space, starfighter corps, and internal politics, and the Gungans, who inhabit underwater cities in strange orbs.   
* Tatooine-Mos Espa: We learn of another large settlement on the desert planet, and of the popular podracing sport.  
* Coruscant: We get a good look at the ecumenopolis of Coruscant, the capital of the republic. We visit the Jedi council in the temple, and the senate building, where representatives of the entire republic meet. We also learn about the politics of the republic.  
* Coruscant again: In Episode 2, we visit new locations in the Jedi Temple and Coruscant, like the Archives, Youngling training, and Dex's Diner.  
* Kamino: The planet of constant storms, where cities are build on stilts. The native population are master cloners whose entire society is based on this. Their extensive facilities are dazzling.  
* Geonosis: We learn of the separatist movement on this desert planet inhabited by geonosians, who have massive droid factories. At the end of the movie, we witness a massive conflict between the republic and CIS.  
  
I'll stop there, as it's only fair to compare the first two movies, but it should be noted that there were even more new locations introduced in Revenge of the Sith. Now let's examine the Sequel planets.  
  
* Jakku: A desert planet with small village settlements and a trade outpost. Evidence of a large battle fought long ago.  
* Takodana: A jungle planet where Maz's castle is located.  
* D'Quar: Home of the resistance HQ, which is a few hangars build into some hills.  
* Starkiller Base: A militarized planet which serves as a bigger Death Star. Entirely Imperial in design and inhabitants.  
* Hosnian Prime: The capital of the new republic, another city planet which we see for all of 10 seconds before it is obliterated. Also somehow destroying one system in a republic of thousands neutralizes them????  
* Ach-To: Home of the ancient Jedi. One island with an ancient settlement.  
* Canto Bight: Casino planet with a nice town, basically Monaco. A retreat for the fabulously wealthy.  
* Crait: Abandoned rebellion base on a salt planet.  
  
 As you can see, the planets in locations introduced in the sequels are unfulfilling because they have only 1 useful feature, and almost none of them are inhabited by people going about their day, or a Cantina/Casino. Everything is militarized. The closest thing to real worldbuilding is Hosnian Prime, but we didn't see enough of it and it's gone anyways. None of these planets have potential for exploration and story. If JJ Abrams wants to fix this, he needs to show more planets with history, where people live and have lived for a long time. We need to see more than just the Resistance and First Order, and their military needs. There is simply nothing to fight over.

The hardest Star Wars physics issue for me to get over,"I know that Star Wars is full of scientific impossibilities but the one that has bothered me most since I realized it is space/time travel.

*Relativistic and Gravitational Time Dilation (E=mc^2)*

If you've seen interstellar you know what I'm talking about. They do a good job of showing what actually would happen when they go down onto the surface of that water planet.

Copypasta example:

""Gravitational time dilation is at play for ISS astronauts too, and it has the opposite effect of the relative velocity time dilation. To simplify, velocity and gravity each slow down time as they increase. Velocity has increased for the astronauts, slowing down their time, whereas gravity has decreased, speeding up time (the astronauts are experiencing less gravity than on Earth). Nevertheless, the ISS astronaut crew ultimately end up with ""slower"" time because the two opposing effects are not equally strong. The velocity time dilation (explained above) is making a bigger difference, and slowing down time. The (time-speeding up) effects of low-gravity would not cancel out these (time-slowing down) effects of velocity unless the ISS orbited much farther from Earth.""

So anyway, it sort of bothers me that this isn't an issue in Star Wars. I get that it would be pointless and probably really annoying to include from a story pov but it's just one of those things that bothers me ever since I realized it.  It would be insanely confusing to keep track of considering how often our characters travel from one system to another. But yeah that's all, just wondering if anyone else thinks about this.

[SPOILER] Luke's instincts,"There's been a lot of discussion over Luke's actions in the flashback(s), with some believing his consideration of killing Ben to be out of character.

I don't think it's that far beyond how Luke is presented in the OT. Initially he's all for killing Vader to avenge his aunt and uncle, Obi-Wan, and his father. When Vader reveals he's Luke's father, it allows him to look beyond the ""monster in a mask"" and see the human underneath. Even Obi-Wan and Yoda urged him to face and strike Vader down in order to become a Jedi Knight, but Luke's instincts told him different.

For me, that's the key: Luke has always trusted his instincts. He did so to destroy the Death Star, and does again to face Vader on Bespin rather than complete his training -- that one was a mistake in the short term, but it allowed him to realize the truth and ultimately redeem Vader. In *ROTJ*, Obi-Wan even tells him:

&gt;Your insight serves you well.

Luke's insight into the truth of Vader helps return Anakin to the light and defeats the Emperor. His insight has served him well at every major decision.

Then comes Ben; his own nephew, except when Luke looks at him through the Force -- using his feelings, his *insight* -- he sees only darkness. Now, Luke's trusted instincts are telling him to *strike Ben down* for the good of the future, in the same way his damaging trip to Bespin was ultimately a good thing, and to ignore the advice of his Jedi Masters and reach out to Vader was a good thing.

Luke, of course, realizes his mistake; that his instincts have been clouded, but by then it's too late. I'd argue that Luke in the flashback does what Luke has *always* done as a hero of the Rebellion and a Jedi Knight: he trusts his instincts.

And they led him wrong, hence retreating into exile unable to trust his insight any more and in an emotional crisis.",StarWars,True,1514988218,2018-01-03
"[Spoilers] ""Skywalker's Seed is Strong""-TLJ Fan Theory","Ok, so I watched TLJ for the second time last night. My opinion on it hasn’t really changed, I think it’s a highly entertaining film albeit flawed in some places. However, there’s a sequence of events that I picked up on which I believe point towards the theory, fairly definitively, that Rey is in fact Luke Skywalker’s daughter. Here’s my crazy crackpot fan theory:

-The thing which tipped me off first was Snoke and Kylo’s first meeting. Over the course of the meeting, Snoke utters something along the lines of “Skywalker’s seed remains strong” or something like that (the term ‘Skywalker’s seed’ is most definitely used, at any rate). That seems to be an oddly specific use of terminology, especially in reference to Luke considering his Jedi temple was destroyed and he has completely hidden himself away from the galaxy for some time.

-While TLJ references the fact that anybody can be a powerful Force sensitive, both Snoke and Luke make comments about the power of genetic pedigree when talking about Ben Solo. Luke more explicitly mentions “that powerful Skywalker blood”.

-Luke is astonished by Rey’s apparently quick seduction by the dark side of the Force, and mentions he has only seen her power once before-in Ben Solo. Ben was also tempted and fell quickly to the dark side. In any event, the powerful Skywalker bloodline appears to be plagued by the powerful allure of the dark side. Obviously Anakin and Kylo succumbed to their inner conflict but Luke himself battles it in ROTJ and in the flashback where he briefly considers killing Kylo. Rey’s own combat style in the movie is also extremely aggressive and she visibly gives in to anger when fighting Snoke’s guards.

-In the Force cave, one of the figures that eventually molds into Rey’s reflection appears to be wearing some kind of hooded robe like the type worn by Luke in the movie.

-Yoda’s line that “there is nothing you have which the girl Rey does not already possess”. Emphasis on the “nothing”. 

-It’s important to note that in TLJ, Luke and Leia are shown as being able to sense each other through the force. It’s heavily implied that this is due to them having a ‘natural’ sibling connection which is restored when Luke opens himself up to the Force again. IMPORTANTLY, this connection appears to be able to extend to a degree of physical contact through Force manifestations, as Luke touches Leia when he appears on Crait. If Kylo and Rey were cousins, they could presumably share a similar connection, as evidenced by when they touch hands on Ahch-To. 

-Another thing I noticed is Snoke’s claim of bridging Rey’s and Kylo’s minds. This can’t be true because if Snoke was able to sense where Rey was and was able to infiltrate her consciousness at all, he would have presumably known about the location of Luke. Furthermore, the connection is shown to be in place after Snoke’s death. This seems to point towards the notion that the connection between them was a natural one in the manner of Luke and Leia.

-Anakin’s lightsaber plays an extremely subtle role in all of this. We have to remember that this is the same lightsaber which called out to Rey originally, an event which itself implied some form of connection. This same lightsaber is used by Kylo to kill his ‘true enemy’, whose primary, stated goal thus far in the sequels thus far is the destruction of Skywalker (Snoke also refers to killing Rey as completing Kylo’s training, which further implies a link). When Rey and Kylo both attempt to force pull Anakin’s lightsaber towards themselves, it ‘obeys’ neither of them. While this could simply imply equivalence in Force prowess between Rey and Kylo, it seems odd considering the saber had an organic attraction to Rey in TFA. Additionally, Luke’s force apparition utilises this same lightsaber instead of his own, trademark green one. In my opinion this is too much of a coincidence to ignore, and symbolises the saber’s inherent connection to the Skywalker bloodline.
-Finally, Leia and Rey are both shown reacting immediately upon the death of Luke. While this doesn’t in itself imply any blood relationship between Rey and Luke, it does demonstrate that Rey’s connection to Luke was seemingly at least as strong as Leia’s.

-Obviously, all of this assumes that Kylo was lying when he said he saw who Rey’s parents were. IMO, he was attempting to sway Rey over to the dark side by capitalizing on something that Snoke, a powerful dark side user, mentions at the beginning of the movie: a weakness, properly manipulated, becomes a sharp instrument. Rey’s weakness is the fear that she is nobody special, that her parents were nothing. It is this same fear which drives her to seek out the cave on Ahch-To even though Luke was appalled by her attraction to the darkness. And as we all know, fear is the path to the dark side. Kylo’s fear was that he wouldn’t live up to his bloodline’s potential, a fear which was manipulated by Snoke. Kylo tries to turn Rey by explicitly telling her that she’s nobody and that she doesn’t matter, but not to him.

-Add all of this stuff to the things we know about Rey from TFA: that she is a great pilot like Anakin, Luke and Kylo, that she is a capable mechanic, that she has a powerful connection to the Force, and that she is a natural with a lightsaber

Anyways, just a crazy crackpot fan theory. Happy to hear rebuttals, additions or any sort of differing opinions.

Was Joruus C'Baoth the first force-using villain in the old Star Wars EU canon after Darth Vader and The Emperor?,"Firstly, hi everyone, I don't think I've posted here before! If I have, I don't remember, so this is as good as my first post.

To better elaborate on my question, I'm curious as to who was the first Sith-like villain introduced the Star Wars Expanded Universe after Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. The Thrawn Trilogy is the earliest work that I've found that has a force user as a villain (Joruus C'Baoth). I find it interesting how they hadn't full established what a ""sith"" was, nor did they settle on whether or not Jedi needed lightsabers all the time. He was a villain that was kind of like The Emperor in that he had mastery of the force beyond the need to use a lightsaber, at least that's the case if we're considering pre-Revenge of the Sith.

The Dangerous Myth of the Mighty Skywalker Bloodline,"The Last Jedi is full of parallels and, in particular, parallel characters. You have Rey and Kylo Ren at the forefront, but you also have the pair of Luke and Snoke looming behind them. And while Luke may merely be bitter and tormented while Snoke is twisted and malevolent, both masters have walked shockingly similar paths with regards to Ben Solo. Luke openly admits to the sin of hubris - excessive pride or self-confidence - and is painfully aware of his failings. Snoke, by contrast, is all-too guilty of hubris but trips up by failing to be mindful of his pride. This lack of self-awareness is what, with delicious inevitability, results in his destruction. Luke is forced to confront his own hubris and pride when Ben Solo turns on him and destroys his temple, whereas Snoke receives no such lesson until it is too late - Kylo’s betrayal ends him definitively, and leaves no room for the reflection that Luke was permitted by his survival.

With regards to Ben Solo, Luke and Snoke both make the same mistake by perceiving the boy primarily in terms of his bloodline. In his nephew, Luke sees “mighty Skywalker blood” that signifies enormous potential in the Force - upon recognising this, Luke resolves that it is his duty to train the boy and allow him to realise his potential. Snoke tells an eerily similar story:

&gt;When I found you, I saw what all masters live to see. Raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special. The potential of your bloodline. A new Vader.

Both Luke and Snoke, in this way, seem fixated on Ben’s lineage - they define him primarily in terms of his bloodline, so it should come as no shock that Ben eventually absorbs this in a thoroughly unhealthy way and finds it impossible to escape from the shadow of his monolithic grandfather. He is always told that his blood means he should achieve greatness, whether for the light or the dark, and this ultimately has the effect of robbing him of his agency. He is a figure in a galactic game of chess, being moved across a board by the same forces of destiny that dictated the movements of his grandfather and uncle. This concept of himself breeds many evils in Ben - entitlement, arrogance, pride and, most poignantly, crippling self-doubt. As long as he is being measured against the Skywalker precedent - by his masters and by himself - Ben always finds himself lacking, with this eternal lack breeding feelings of frustration and self-loathing.

We know little of Ben’s time under Luke, but we do know that he was already under Snoke’s influence and had had the seeds of darkness sown in his mind. When Luke looked into Ben’s mind he was filled with fear over his nephew’s potential for evil, and contemplated murdering the boy in his sleep - Ben waking to witness his uncle’s green lightsaber ignited above him is the precipitating event in his downfall. In relation to hubris, we must look at this event as Luke’s turning point - the moment he considered murdering the boy he had placed such hope in and devoted so much energy to training was the moment when his own self-belief and confidence were shattered. In this moment, Luke believed his nephew to be capable of tremendous harm and his faith in the Skywalker bloodline’s potential for good was shattered. Luke’s realisation of Ben’s potential for evil and the terrible aftermath of his moment of weakness destroy his pride and send him into exile.

Instead of guiding a beloved nephew to use his powers for good, Snoke seized upon the lost Ben Solo and exploited him as a weapon. He craved the “mighty Skywalker blood”, attracted to its potential just as Luke once was, and took the newly renamed Kylo Ren under his wing as his apprentice. Snoke picked up the dropped threads of Luke’s training by continuing to tell Kylo that he was special and worthy by dint of his blood, but he also used this knowledge as an instrument of cruelty and punishment. In The Last Jedi, we see Snoke humiliate Kylo, telling him:

&gt;Yes, there it is. You have too much of your father's heart in you, Young Solo.

Han Solo represents the complicated and messy elements of Ben Solo that neither Luke nor Snoke wished to confront. Han Solo was the antithesis to Anakin Skywalker, being resoundingly normal. Han was as mundane and ordinary as Anakin was unique and gifted. While invoking the name of Anakin Skywalker calls to mind high-flung concepts like destiny and fate, the name of Han Solo suggests fast ships and gambling tables. Conditioned to buy into the story of his own special destiny by both his masters, Ben has come to share in this distaste, even as a part of him continues to love his father and bitterly regrets killing him. For Ben, his father was emblematic of the human fragility and weakness that was keeping him from fulfilling his long-promised destiny as the last Skywalker.

Snoke’s hubris meets a deliciously satisfying end when he pays the price for it with his murder. Snoke considers Kylo Ren his instrument, and his close control of his mind means he is arrogant enough to believe in his apprentice’s total loyalty. He considers Rey and Kylo his playthings, claiming authorship of the Force connection between Rey and Kylo in a move that clearly shocks and angers them both. The Force bond had facilitated intensely private and intimate moments between them, resulting in blossoming feelings of tenderness and trust, and to be told that it was merely an instrument of Snoke’s is clearly a violation that Rey and Kylo both reject. Regardless of how the bond came about, the feelings that emerged through it were palpably genuine.

Snoke’s vanity means he cannot conceive of the possibility that Kylo may have surpassed him, and he seems to enter into a state of near-sexual ecstasy as he dives into Kylo’s mind and experiences his murderous mental calculations. Snoke takes pleasure in the prospect of Rey’s murder at Kylo’s hand, considering the annihilation of the light counterpart to his dark apprentice the ultimate display of loyalty. The great and glorious irony, of course, is that the murder he is taking such delight in is actually his own:

&gt;You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed, I cannot be beaten. I see his mind, I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child, he ignites it, and kills his true enemy!

Snoke pays the ultimate price for his hubris with his death, but Kylo Ren cannot escape from the vision of himself he has had built up in his mind for decades. He continues to envisage himself as a subject of fate and destiny - he may have been cut loose from Snoke, but he has not cut himself loose from the chains of his own past. One of Kylo’s many tragedies is that he urges Rey to “let the past die” without achieving this himself - he continues to believe in the myth of the “mighty Skywalker blood”, and this arrogance means it feels natural to him to claim his place as the ruler of the galaxy. The only real complication to his destiny is his intense feelings for Rey - a “nothing” child born to wastrel parents who abandoned her. She had no legends or prophecies preceding her, and has no pre-ordained place in the story as Kylo Ren does. Kylo’s passion for her, his overwhelming feelings of love and tenderness, means he likely perceives her as the Padme to his Anakin - the love that he has always lacked and has only just realised how much he longed for. In his hubris and short-sightedness, Kylo cannot recognise that this vision of the Skywalker destiny ended in tragedy before and will surely end in tragedy again. Padme was heartbroken and appalled by Anakin’s ambition, and Rey is similarly repelled by Kylo’s choice. Only at the very end of the film, when he has to look up upon Rey as she closes the door of his father’s beloved ship in his face, does the emptiness of the Skywalker myth truly strike him. Kylo fulfilled Anakin Skywalker’s dream of ruling the galaxy, finishing what he started, but is crippled by the knowledge that he will do so alone. At the end of the film, he is finally left to carve his own path for the first time with no scripted destiny to guide him - but what should have been a triumph is yet another tragedy.

While Kylo absorbs and is further wounded by his masters’ hubris, Luke ultimately learns from his own mistakes. I would argue that a key aspect of his redemption arc is that he learns from his hubris and moves forward with a new perspective founded on hope and openness. Luke condemns the Jedi for restricting ownership of the Force, and clearly considers the Skywalkers themselves almost cursed and doomed to failure and tragedy - he includes himself in this estimation, having exiled himself to Ahch-To to die. Luke performs a sharp turn away from hubris by losing confidence and exhibiting no pride in his bloodline at all, which makes his journey throughout the film - which sees him recover hope for the future of the Jedi through his interactions with Rey - remarkably powerful. At first he’s frightened by Rey’s connection with Kylo, entering into an explosive rage in an attempt to drive the two young people apart. He pleads with Rey not to give into her visions of Ben Solo returning to the light, and briefly feels helpless upon witnessing her departure in the Falcon. But Yoda reminds Luke of the importance of allowing failure, and gives Luke the resolve he needs to trust that Rey will make the right choice when the moment comes. Rey’s faith and goodness must remind Luke of his own actions - rushing off to save his friends despite his master’s warning, insisting on the possibility of bringing his father back despite everyone else’s lack of faith - as a young man, and he clearly sees in her the hope that he once embodied. He is inspired by this and is given a new sense of inner peace and comfort. Rey’s hope gives him hope in turn, and allows him to achieve the peace and calm that we can presume had eluded him since Ben Solo’s turn. When Luke appears on Crait, he is a finely tooled instrument of the Light side, with his resolve and determination showing up Kylo’s chaotic and unfinished state. He has regained hope and confidence, telling his sister that “no one is ever truly lost” even as he admits that neither of them will be able to bring Ben Solo back.

Hope for the future no longer lies in the older generation or the mythic blood that runs through their veins - it is instead embodied by Rey, and all the others like her who continue to struggle for what is right in the face of darkness and adversity. If Kylo is to escape his own past and break free from the poisonous Skywalker destiny, then he will have to learn the hardest lesson of them all for a man who was raised on the myth of his own inevitable greatness - humility.",StarWars,True,1514991230,2018-01-03

That leaves Ben/Kylo and since he is now the main baddie with Snoke gone that means it is likely he dies to end the series. Thus the Skywalker bloodline will end,StarWars,True,1514991659,2018-01-03

A possible REAL LIFE reason for Luke's passing..,"""Killing off"" the original cast, may be a good idea... I mean Carrie Fisher is already gone, Harrison Ford was NO spring chicken, and Mark Hamill, is 65 (though still kicking it).. but father time waits for no man.

Posit this: We know that Carrie Fisher's scenes were finished filming before her passing.... Have we been told if they had to rewrites of the script for the other characters... Could they have ""rewritten"" Luke's passing to possibly avoid a similar situation if Mark Hamill prematurely passed between now and Ep IX? I don't believe this has been explicitly asked or addressed. Please correct me if I'm wrong",StarWars,True,1514992095,2018-01-03

Have we thought through what would have actually happened had they revealed a certain character's backstory? (spoilers),"A lot of people are upset that Snoke did not get a backstory explained in TLJ, but I was thinking about how that could have been added and came to a realization.  It is actually better this way.  

The most probable way to get the information would have been to have Rey ask either Luke or Kylo.  They could have explained who he was, how he got the power, and how he managed to convert Kylo.  In other words we would be having this super powerful character get a build up...and then killed 10 minutes later.  I have to imagine the outrage of that would have been even worse.  Why build up this character to only have him die so unceremoniously?  Maybe that would have worked had this been the end of the trilogy, but it is super anti-climatic to have happen in the middle of it.

I do want to know more about the character, and there is still a chance that we will get the full story in episode IX since it is so critical to Ben's backstory. ",StarWars,True,1514993933,2018-01-03

The anticlimactic ending of Episode IX,"TLJ felt like a finale that ended on a downnote but with a big spark of hope.

The last two films of the ST the new republic got destroyed, the galaxy got subjugated by the FO and even the Resistance got decimated to a handful of people.

In the end of TLJ Luke says that this was only the beginning of the war.

So what will happen in IX? Rey and Ben get their final confrontation and the resistance fleet will be big enough to crush the FO?

And if this is the finale of the Skywalker saga how will they finalize it? Killing Ben and Hux and win some big battle isn't enough, for all we know there could be some other dark sider just around the corner, taking over the galaxy again.

I really got distracted from my beginning point, but seriously, do you think we will get more closure to this conflict than in RotJ? And isn't it a bit weird that we don't see any growth og the resistance but will probably get an enormous fleet in IX? ",StarWars,True,1514994382,2018-01-03

"Asked some coworkers, who are causal movie goers, what they thought of The Last Jedi after I got back to Work from Holiday Break","I got some interesting responses. Most of them just have a passing knowledge of Star Wars as a part of our current pop culture, having seen most of the movies once or twice. There was a variety of ages, with the youngest being 22 and the oldest being 60. Here are some of the responses I got

**Q1) What were some of your thoughts overall?**

Casey (56): I thought it was really good. It was kind of long though. 

Brad (54): I agree. I kind of zoned out around the hour and half mark.

Ana (31): I didn't really have an issue with it's length. I wasn't really sure what to think of Luke when I first saw him. I think he turned out really cool though. I liked his scene with Leia a lot.

Rob (35): So did I. It was really emotional. My wife had tears in her eyes. 

**Me: I bet you totally did too.**

Rob (35): Oh yeah, totally... Cried like a little girl... s/

Damon (60): I thought it was kind of weird that the Empire...

**Me: First Order**

Damon (60): whatever ...Same thing. First Order. I found it weird how they got so powerful so fast. And the Republic just fell after those three planets blew up? That's a pretty weak government. 

**Me: So, you thought that was a weak piece of the storytelling?**

Damon (60): I just wished they explained the *how* a bit better. And the Why. If the Republic is so weak, why do they want to return to it. 

**Me: Fair enough.**

Casey (56): I didn't even really notice it honestly. I just figured they were the Empire, so of course they'd take over like that. 

Ana (31): I didn't really have a problem with that either. I just assumed that the bad guys had been building up for a while and took the good guys by surprise. Did they say the Republic was defeated in this movie?

**Me: The opening crawl did**

Ana (31) Oh, must have missed that.

**Q2) What did you think of the Casino Planet Scene?**

Damon (60): Wasn't a huge fan. It looked like it came from another movie.

Brad (54): I liked it actually. I thought it was cool to see something different in Star Wars like that.

Ana (31): The horse - dog things were pretty cute. And I liked the new girl a lot. Finn kinda felt out of place though. 

Casey (56): I agree with Brad. I liked it a lot. It was cool to see stuff that didn't look like the normal ""Star Wars-y"" stuff. 

Ken (22): I think there was a bit too much CGI and the hacker wasn't too interesting.

**Me: Really? I liked the ambiguity of his morality. Even though the scene itself wasn't great, for me, I liked that he had a unique lesson for a Star Wars film.**

Ken (22): Yeah, but he just kind of felt like not really Han Solo to me. Like, his message was interesting, but as a character he felt really generic. 

(We then devolved into a conversation on who played DJ and what else he's been in, which then turned into a Guardians of the Galaxy convo. I had to steer us back on track with a new question)

**Q3) What did you think of Kylo Ren and Rey?**

Damon (60): I liked them both a lot. The plot twist about her parents was really well done. 

Casey (56): I like how they killed the Supreme Leader.

**Me: Even though they didn't reveal anything about him?**

Casey (56): Yeah, that was weird, but I just assumed the next movie will do that. I liked that Kylo Ren became the main bad guy.

Ken (22): I wasn't a huge fan of the way Snoke died and was quickly forgotten after the last movie made a big deal about him. Was he supposed to be a joke?

**Me: I think he was supposed to subvert expectations.**

Ken (22): I guess that make sense. Still wish we were given something about him though. Like, how did he corrupt Kylo Ren?

Ana (31): Casey is probably right. They'll probably cover that in the next one. I liked Rey a lot. I thought the actress did a really good job showing how emotionally complex she was. 

**Me: Agreed**

Damon (60): I thought the mirror thing was really cool. I like how it *said* a lot without actually *saying* a lot. It felt like something from 2001 A Space Odyssey. 

**Q4: Finally, what did we think about Luke and the big twist at the end?**

Ana (31): I liked the illusion thing, but I didn't think he'd die. I don't know if I liked that or not. I guess if he shows up in the next movie I'm okay with it. 

Damon (60): He'll probably be a ghost, like Yoda was. 

Casey (56): I thought it was weird that he didn't turn his sword off when Kylo woke up. 

**Me: I mean, he just had a brief flash of instinct that cause him to turn it on**

Casey (56): Yeah, but you'd think he'd turn it off when he said it passed and he noticed Kylo was awake. 

**Me: Maybe he felt Kylo was about to retaliate?**

Ana (31): I think you're thinking too hard about this. It was just a cool flashback. 

Ken (22): Kylo collapsing the hut was a really cool shot. I didn't really have any problems with the flashback. Luke told it twice, so his second time might not even be fully truthful. 

**Me: What would be the point of that**

Ken (22): To keep some crazy reveal for the next movie

**Me: Fair, I guess**

Ana (31): The milk thing was real gross though. 

Casey (56): I thought it was stupid. 

Damon (60): I thought it was hilarious. That look Luke gave Rey was priceless. I'm kind of disappointed that Luke didn't actually fight Kylo Ren. I thought it would have been cooler if he danced around him as a distraction, showed he was an illusion, and then in the next movie fights him for real. 

**Me: I kind of agree with that.**

Then we had to go back to the office. I parred this down a bit, due to some of the other tangents we went on, but this was the basic gist. Seems like they liked it plenty, with some minor gripes. Definitely not as many as I had, but it was refreshing seeing the movie from their non-fan, non-critical (except Damon a bit) perspectives. ",StarWars,True,1514995159,2018-01-03
[Spoilers] Is The Last Jedi a Heroic Journey or... a Tragedy?,"The Last Jedi tells two parallel stories: The heroic journey of Rey/Luke/Leia and the tragedy of Poe/Finn/Rose. The heroic characters inspire the tragic characters to pursue their own heroic journey yet they only find tragedy. That half of Last Jedi is a tragedy explains the dissonance many viewers feel. ""This feels like a Star Wars movie... but something is off.""

Let's look at the evidence:

* Poe ignores orders, attacks the dreadnaught and destroys it. While this heroic act ""succeeds,"" it does not help the Resistance at all and instead only leads to the deaths of many pilots as well as the loss of every bomber in the fleet.

* Rose prevents deserters from taking escape pods. While this seems like a noble cause ""for the Resistance!"" it is essentially a death sentence for anyone she prevents from escaping.

* Rose is inspired to be a hero when she meets Finn who she imagines is a famous hero... yet Finn is actually running away.

* Finn and Rose oddly turn to Maz for assistance. Maz herself is engaged in a heroic(?) fight with... union employees? Maz tells them to find ""The Code Breaker"" a classic heroic storyline of ""finding the chosen one."" Of course, Finn and Rose end up with DJ, a second rate Code Breaker who just happens to be convenient and dooms the Resistance's escape chance. (A true anti-hero, DJ appears with cases full of credits a la Han Solo but without the redemption.)

* Finn and Rose are captured and imprisoned... for a parking violation.

* Finn and Rose are captured (again) and about to be executed... only to be saved by BB8, the only truly heroic character of the bunch. Also notice that it is Captain Phasma's droid (the only competent villain on Captain Phasma's team) that notices the tragic ""heroes"" and leads to their capture.

* Of side note, notice that Captain Phasma is also a tragic character and total failure. In Force Awakens, her only role is to give up the passcode without a fight. In Last Jedi, she serves as a villainous foil for the tragic wannabe heroes, yet she achieves nothing, except an epic death which she did not earn. This epic death feels like Star Wars but is again, slightly off, because of the incompetence factor. She's no Boba Fett or Darth Maul.

* Poe's epic mutiny leads to... absolutely nothing.

* Finn tries to heroically sacrifice himself to stop the mini-Death Star but Rose heroically sacrifices herself to stop Finn (thereby denying the Resistance much needed time.) In doing so, she gravely injures herself and achieves little but to save Finn's life... who she still believes to be a hero, but has done nothing recently to earn that title. (Compare this to Hodo's sacrifice which actually saves many transports from certain destruction.)

Now, contrast that all with the ending of the film, which implies the Resistance has somehow ""won"" because it has inspired the galaxy to fight back through its actions. If those who are inspired are all as incompetent as Poe, Rose and Finn, the galaxy is doomed.

I'm not sure what Rian Johnson meant to achieve by telling a parallel ""tragic"" version of a Star Wars story. It is certainly interesting and disconcerting: it follows the shape of a Star Wars story, but the characters are complete failures (they are wannabes, hero worshippers) but what does it achieve? One could argue it is meant to trigger the same feelings and emotions as a Greek Tragedy but in the context of and running parallel to a more classic Heroic Journey it just feels like self-parody.

What do you think? Is the Poe/Finn/Rose story really a tragedy? Why do you think Rian Johnson included it? Perhaps, so the characters can redeem themselves in future episodes (after all, this is the second film in a Trilogy where every hero needs to suffer a crisis?)",StarWars,True,1514995539,2018-01-03

What I disliked about the New Starwars movie,"/s1 The Asian engineer girl. Her character felt extremely forced and she did little to add to the plot. (When I’m rooting for one of the “good guys to die” You messed up the character. Her little stunt on the final battle confirmed my absolute hate for her character. Had there not been a backdoor like they thought when she pulled her stupid stunt the rebel alliance would have been slaughtered. She would have ended the rebellion. 

2 The Casino planet didn’t feel like star wars to me at all. It was weird and didn’t fit. I was actually having to keep myself awake while watching this whole scene. The Master code breaker they were looking for was in a jail cell? The odds of that happening are ludicrous. He could have gotten out whenever he wanted yet waited for Finn and diversity hire to show up. Why Finn and the engineer where put in jail for parking there instead of being told to move the ship or given a ticket. 

3 The first order is stupid. Their command structure is awful. Higher ups humiliate subordinates in front of each other which would just fall down the ranks and make everyone resent everyone. The tracking through hyperspace doesn’t make much sense but didn’t really bother me what did is the fact that they only track the biggest ship. Why not track all 3? Why not track everything in that general area. Commander ginger nazi was so over the top I found myself laughing at him. I don’t believe him being one of the highest-ranking generals of the first order. He’s too young the Empire had people like Grand Moff Tarkin who looked older and wiser along with some younger mid 40’s early 50’s generals who weren’t as experienced. The fact they couldn’t penetrate the rebel shields didn’t make sense to me and was never explained well. (Don’t tell me anything that begins with In the books or In the lore) This is a critique of the movie not the lore. 

4 Rey is a Mary Sue no way around that. She beats like 5 Imperial guards who are the best of the best in the First Order. She apparently knows all there is in the Jedi texts according to Yoda without reading them. Rey beats Luke in a fight with no lightsaber training. She also speaks fluent Chewbacca because why not. 

5 Snoke who is he why is he so powerful and why doesn’t he notice the lightsaber right next to him moving. Snoke is a complete waste of a character now who can use all these new powers which I don’t mind but can’t tell that Kylo is moving a lightsaber right next to him. 

6 Edgy Boi Kylo Ren I just found him annoying and stupid. He’s the most powerful force user ever seen or one of them yet can’t take the lightsaber from Rey. His over the top antics are annoying and I don’t take him seriously as the new leader of the First Order. When he “killed’’ Luke along with the other apprentices they made the point of saying some of them joined him what happened to them because this would break the rule of 2.  

7 Leia being superman enough said. 

8 The scene where Edgy Boi and Mary Sue both are using the force on Luke’s lightsaber the scene itself is actually quite good it just opens a huge can of worms. Why wouldn’t a Jedi or Sith who’s facing someone who is force weaker then them just force grab their lightsaber from them. If your stronger they couldn’t do it back to you and you would win the fight easy. Why can’t you turn off the enemies lightsaber when fighting them. Granted these were always questions but now that it’s confirmed you can force grab an other persons lightsaber why don’t people do it? 

9 Purple Haired Girl I don’t remember her name and don’t care to look it up. She was annoying stupid and just as authoritarian as the first order. Why she wouldn’t tell Poe the plan at first is beyond me. Why she chose to stay back and pilot the ship is too. Yes I’m happy she’s dead but from a story perspective why can’t somebody else pilot the ship how hard is it to steer straight. Also her hyperspace ram opens up questions about why the First Order doesn’t do this. With all their money surely they could make some large ships that are unmanned or manned by drones. Station them on a far out planet. When a space battle starts they speed of near the battle and when the Empire gets the coordinates of a ship they could jump through that location and destroy the rebels. 

10 Luke I hated everything about his character the way he just tosses his lightsaber away and refuses to train Mary Sue. The fact he’s surprised she’s here despite the fact that he made a map to his location and hid parts of it which makes no sense unless he hid the part where he was hiding out on and even then it would be possible to fly to the planets that are in the missing piece of the map which wouldn’t be impossible. This movie made me hate Luke who was my second favorite character before. 

11 Admiral Ackbar dying why couldn’t Leia round up a couple or all of the commanders when she was flying through space like Superman. 

12 The jokes were awful and didn’t fit the tone of the rest of the movie. I laughed only once when Snoke was toying with Mary Sue. 

13 Nothing happened plot wise really. Snoke died but he didn’t do much anyway and Luke died? Also the resistance is practically over although why their called the resistance is beyond me considering they are closer to being in power than the First Order is.

14 Captain Phasma did nothing relevant and died in a melee fight to Fin despite having a blaster on her that she could have killed him with. She doesn’t even draw it after being defeated.

Rant with my opinion on the whole fan backlash to TLJ,"So, after fully watching this video here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNoMQSvNAWE) I had enough with the whole hate on The Last Jedi and started a comment explaining how I think that most of this hate is completely unjustified. It kind of got out of hand and became a full 2000 word essay so I thought I would post it here as well. (That means that 'you' mostly refers to all the haters I saw in the comment section) Obviously, spoilers.



I really cannot believe what I watched just now. This guy is so blinded by his hate and denial of the movie that he desperately searches every ever-so-tiny aspect for weak points to make a shitty and unfunny joke about and use as tools to somehow inforce his insanely skewed and biased excuse for an opinion on this movie.

Sure, there's a lot of things wrong with this movie. The pacing on Ach-To could have been done better, Rey didn't really have an interesting development, Rose wasn't introduced well enough for viewers to really understand her and there were a few minor plot inconveniences that made some parts difficult to understand when watching for the first time without following other Star Wars content.

But the point remains that 95% of the points he brings up here are either completely unimportant, only seem bad because of how superficially they are discussed, or are just plain wrong. Sure, the porgs and crystal foxes could have been left out of the movie with no big consequence. Maybe the Canto Bight part turned out to be irrelevant to the plot. But is that such a bad thing that you have to endlessly and senselessly berate the movie because of it? Boba Fett had next to no function in the original trilogy and everyone loves him for it, I'm going to get back to that. He complains endlessly about how many lore points were left unexplained by the movie. Now, for some parts that is just entirely incorrect, Phasma getting off Starkiller Base or the backstory of the rise of the First Order, and in turn its military strength compared to that of the Resistance have been thoroughly explained in books and comics adding to the Star Wars universe, but my actual point is that this can in no way be used to argue against the movie.
Bringing up the original trilogy again, we knew nothing of the sort of what he asked for in those movies - we had no idea where the Empire came from, the origins of the Emperor, his power and his connection to Vader were never explained, as were how Vader fell to the dark side and how Obi-Wan played into it (at least no more than Luke and Kylo's backstory was explained in The Last Jedi). You just cannot criticize The Last Jedi for not explaining such unnecesarry details that would make the plot so much more confusing and break the pace completely while simultaneously praising the Original Trilogy for anything and everything that it did, including exactly the omission of such backstory.

Be honest, would you have reacted any differently had The Last Jedi taken the time to explain Snoke's backstory, how he got to Kylo and how the First Order was formed? No, definitely not. You would have gone ""I hate the Last Jedi for ruining all the mystery and room for theories and speculation we got from The Force Awakens, now watching it is not fun anymore, what an insult to Star Wars and how it always gave such mystery, worst movie ever, blah, blah"". Remember how that went with midichlorians? That's right, exactly like this.

I'm not going to go over every point he talks about here because I don't need a huge argument about such details and that is not even the actual problem here - again more on this later, just be aware that I could if you wanted me to. Again, some of these points are valid criticism, but for the most part, they are just weak spots he found that he could make a joke about and suddendly blew up to huge criticism he rants about for five minutes.

One point I do want to touch on though, is Luke Skywalker.
So many people complained that his new personality is a complete disgrace to everything the original trilogy set up about him, and it might be on the surface. But I think that what is really going on is that he just isn't what you all expected him to be in this new movie, and that now everyone is feeling betrayed because their exact expectations which they and only they had weren't fulfilled.
I personally found Luke's attitude in the beginning of The Last Jedi and his actions before it very believable and arising from how he was in the original trilogy, especially after watching the movie a second time. Yes, I did that, can you believe it. Luke's very father was corrupted and fell to the dark side, causing the death of the Jedi and the rise of the Empire with it. Luke himself has experienced so much pain because of this and was only barely able to bring him back. (In a scene in which the Emperor was just as cocky as Snoke was in TLJ, with noone complaining about it) Right after his father's redemption he saw him die full of regret and pain. He has seen what the dark side can do, more than anyone else. He knows that Obi-Wan failed as a teacher and would try anything to prevent make the same mistake himself. When he started seeing small bits of darkness in him, he got more and more scared that the story of Darth Vader would repeat himself, that he would fail just as Obi-Wan did. When he got more and more concerned, he reached into Ben and saw a deep pit of darkness (yes, that was what he saw, not only small glimpses and flashes that might be true like this guy portrayed it, trying to downplay it.). Anyone in his situation would try anything to prevent it, and maybe even ignite his lightsaber in a flash of fear and panic. After Ben destroying the temple, he realised that he failed just like Obi-Wan did before him and how the cycle repeated itself. Together with the birds-eye view he got from Yoda he would try to end the cycle by ending the era of the Jedi entirely. That played together with him exploring the nature of the force between ROTJ and TFA, finding out how it is a lot more about the balance and being guided by the force than it is about using it to fight battles.
Basically, looking at the character a bit closer you see how easily someone who has experienced what Luke did could come to make the decisions he made in and before The Last Jedi, the problem is just that you, the fans who came into the movie with so many expectations and wouldn't accept anything other than that, looked at him too superficially to even allow yourself to understand that.

If you listen to what this guy says in this video, you see how many of these superficial points that might be true from one specific angle but not in any other ways he brings forward and how many bad jokes, curses, and insults he pads them with to somehow make this video coherent and have it seem like it actually has enough actual content to objectively discuss the movie. He so often says how the movie is an insult to Star Wars, how elements contradict themselves and how it destroyed the ideas of the old trilogy's characters, but I find very little actual evidence on which he bases that. Sure, he brings up some points scattered around here and there, but again most of them can be explained if you're willing to think about it for more than the five seconds that your mind allows for contemplating the fact that the movie might actually not be as bad as you wanted it to be. Again, most of the points are just backed by more insults and empty assertions which just serve to direct you guys against this movie even more - after all, you are looking everywhere for reasons to hate it so this video is just pure fuel for all those haters.

After thirty years of the Original Trilogy being out there, all the Star Wars fans had their own expectations of how they wanted The Last Jedi to go - how they wanted the Original Trilogy's characters to continue their legacy, how they wanted the story to be and how they wanted new and original story ideas while staying close to the Original Trilogy to not ruin any childhood memories. Yeah, that's a contradiction right there. The thing is, the whole problem with The Last Jedi already started way before it even came out. After The Force Awakens was criticized for just being a rehash of the Original Trilogy (that's one point of the spectrum) everyone who is complaining now already had the mindset that Disney was going to ruin Star Wars, so when The Last Jedi came out they (subconciously) wanted it to be bad whatever happened, so that they could further prove their point that Disney is ruining Star Wars, so that they would have someone to blame for the movie not fulfilling every single one of their old expectations. This is turning into people trying to find whatever weak spot they can find to have something to criticize about the movie and then proceed to blow it up to be the really big deal that ruined the movie, together with the whole franchise and their childhood memories completely, with that of course being all Disney's fault and not caused by their contradicting expectations. These kinds of fans do not allow anything new into their bubbles of the holy Original Trilogy, because what comes after that can apparently somehow change these sacred movies that are already there. At the same time, they of course do not want to feel catered to by the filmmakers because they tried to give them everything they loved about the original movie - this was pretty much the only point everyone criticized about The Force Awakens. This again shows how nothing could really satisfy this part of the fanbase because they take whatever they need to make some movie look good or bad and completely ignore the rest - Captain Phasma is being shit on because she didn't get enough action, but neither did Boba Fett and he is loved by everybody. People hate the new movies because they don't explain finer details about the lore, but again, that is exactly what the original trilogy did. And I bet that if the movie had gone the other way with some of these points, people would have complained about that too - If Phasma had had some more amazing fights and a bigger part in the story that part of the fanbase would complain that she is overused, broke the pace of the film, didn't have enough backstory, was unnecessary, was just fanservice, et cetera, just choose one. If the movie took pauses to explain the backstory of Snoke, Kylo, the First Order, the Resistance, and everything else People would have complained about the mystery being ruined and the pace of the film being broken for unnecessary explainations. People complained about there suddenly being so many new ships and vehicles but when we didn't know about Canto Bight yet they were complaining that there weren't any new alien species introduced. Not that we've seen Canto Bight we get complaints about all these new aliens serving no purpose and I think the film would easily have been criticized just the same when it kept to all the already established technology since that would just again be fanservice and riding on the success of the Original Trilogy.
So really, I think that the problem actually lies in people just sincerely wanting to hate the movie because they think it will somehow make them seem more intelligent, objective and reflected and because of this use everything they can find as an argument against the movie. This does not only happen with Star Wars, it is a way bigger problem that can be found just the same with the new Star Trek Reboot, some Marvel movies or pretty much any sequel to an older successful movie, book, or game, but with how much hype there was around The Last Jedi, this trend has reached entirely new heights. I'm pretty sure that Marvel's Infinity War will be criticized in similar ways, as would, say, a new Elder Scrolls game or something, just because it dared to try to add to old memories we had about any given franchise.
Again, I'm not saying that The Last Jedi is perfect, it definitely has its flaws, just like any movie does. But in absolutely no way does it deserve the backlash it has been getting about ruining Star Wars entirely, that is just what these haters tell themselves as an excuse for realizing that the movie made Star Wars not be exactly what they had imagined themselves to be.
I realize fully well that I'm going to be called a blind fan that doesn't see the truth of how horrible this movie supposedly really is, and if it satisfies you to do that, be my guest. But please ask yourself if you disliking the movie is really only because you can find valid, objective arguments showing what the movie did wrong, or if it actually is because you are just so angry and eager to hate it that you will take anything you find as cannon fodder for insults and criticism. Although, really, noone of you is going to read this anyway because you don't want to believe me, so I don't even need to write this.

[Spoiler] Something I noticed on my 2nd viewing,"First time through I didn't notice this, but when Luke is facing Kylo on Crait the camera pans to the side and the way Kylo's cloak and hair sits gives a very chilling silhouette very much akin to Vader.

Something I noticed,"Just saw the film yesterday and I loved it! I just noticed something towards the end and I haven't seen any discussion on it. 

When Rey and Finn are back on the Falcon in the end of the movie, Finn opens up a drawer to put something in for 1/2 a second. When the drawer opens, you can see the sacred Jedi texts. (Possibly stolen when Rey leaves Luke?)

This started me thinking that when Luke was going to set fire to the tree (where the texts were held) he never actually gets a chance to walk inside.  Yoda shows up and talks to Luke and proceeds to set fire to the tree himself. 

Does this mean that Luke never realized the texts were saved? Did Yoda know they weren't in there? Is Rey going to revive the Jedi religion? What are your opinions/theories! ",StarWars,True,1514052544,2017-12-23

[Spoilers] The Last Jedi and the Posisble Implications on Future Force Users,"“Powerful light, powerful darkness.”

This is one of the most important things Luke tells us about the Force in this movie, which really ties into the overall theme of the movie, which can be summed up in one word: Balance 

As a rehash, what Luke meant was that the stronger a person or group is with the light side, the stronger the dark side becomes. 

And we saw that the Jedi became very strong with the light over the course of 1,000 years, causing equally strong dark side users to appear.

In the course of this movie, it seems like the idea behind the Jedi has changed. Whereas the Jedi would preach only light side use, it seems that Luke’s method of teaching Force users has changed. 

If one is balanced, one side doesn’t grow stronger than the other side. This means both “sides” of the force remain the same, and its balance is only disrupted by those who decide to use only one “side” of the Force. 

Now, I’m of the opinion that there aren’t sides of the Force but rather that it’s the attitude, the approach to the Force that makes it the dark side.

If you use the Force for purely selfish and evil motives, the individual makes his Force use aligned with the dark side.

The Force is one singular cosmic entity, and does not choose sides. 

Its users, however, do choose sides.

With that said, I think we could essentially see a future generation of Force users that use both sides of the Force, essentially removing “sides” of the Force, and it just being *the* Force. 

If taught well, these future users could be balanced and not preach or promote one “side” of the Force over another, and could very well bring true balance to the Force.

[Spoilers] I do not understand the purpose of Rey's character.,"I was not a fan of TFA and one of my complaints was that Rey was too good at everything - piloting/fixing the millennium falcon, speaking wookie, using the jedi mind trick, fighting with a lightsaber, and never making any mistakes. The only counter-argument that I ever got was ""you have to wait until the next film that will explain everything.""

Well the explanation that we go is that she's nobody. People defending this say something along the lines of, ""The point is that anyone can become a jedi, you don't need to be of a great bloodline. Not everything has to be about the Skywalker family. She isn't some special chosen one.""

I understand that the idea that anyone can become a jedi is interesting, BUT anyone becoming the most powerful jedi in a matter of days with close to no real training is just ridiculous. She hasn't worked towards achieving any of the power that she has been given in the story. Also she is a de facto ""chosen one"" because the Force chose her as the balance for Kylo's darkness so she isn't just any random person.

(Last Jedi Spoiler) Why a scene from the Last Jedi didn't bother me,"Now I can admit that ""The Last Jedi"" had a lot of problems and was by no means a perfect movie. I would personally give it a 7/10, but one scene that everyone seems to go crazy over, and its the flashback where Luke tries to kill Ben Solo as a child. Here is why it didn't bother me as much as everyone else

A common problem is that Luke from ROTJ would never try to kill a child, even kill anyone like he tried to do with ben. However, I don't believe this is true. He, in ROTJ, openly tried to murder Darth Vader, when he was on the ground and defenseless. What was Ben? On the ground and defenseless. Luke has made mistakes, and he himself says the mistake was from his own hubris and arrogance that led to the creation of Kylo Ren, and thus this decision. This was (IMO) supposed to show the failure of the Jedi way. The reason according to Luke himself for the Fall of the Jedi was because of the hubris and arrogance of the Jedi themselves, which showed a fundamental flaw with the Jedi and their decision making. Luke failed Ben just like Obi Wan failed Anakin/ The Jedi failed Anakin. Both of the failures on both parts caused the slaughter of many Jedi. This was IMO a reflection on ROTS. The HUBRIS and ARROGANCE of the Jedi (Luke in TLJ, or The council in ROTS) led to their mistakes and eventual failure. Luke's decision was something most powerful Jedi fell to. Mace Windu tried to kill Palpatine instead of giving him a trial, When the council didn't give Anakin access to the information he wanted, which was stemmed from the Jedi believing their own visions and sensing of darkness in Anakin, resulting in Anakin distrusting the Jedi, and the eventually Jedi Massacre. Sound like anyone you know?

tl:dr - Luke fell to the same hubris and arrogance as the Jedi Council. He wasn't perfect and was susceptible to the same mistakes that the original Jedi made. He even made similar mistakes before trying to kill Ben

I got the feeling on second viewing that this was a hint as to the fact Luke wasn’t really there. As though 3PO’s sensors somehow caught that there was no heartbeat or brainwaves. Luke’s wink then is a sign to him to keep his trap shut. It also seems 3PO’s reaction would have been much different if Luke were really there (As when he saw Han in TFA for instance).

[Spoiler] My thoughts about two specific plot points in TLJ that I did not really enjoy.,"In this post I'm not going to address my general thoughts about the movie (I *generally* liked it, although I had some issues with it). Instead, I will be focusing, as the title suggests, on **two** specific plot-points in the movie, that I did not enjoy. Both of them fall under the same category of *""killing"" interesting and important characters too soon*. I do not know if a similar post has already been made, since I just yesterday found time to watch the movie, and I haven't managed to read many S.W.-related posts since. 
Keep in mind, you are entitled to your opinion as I am entitled to mine. And since the winter holidays have just started,m I have plenty of time to read your opinions, whether you agree or not, and I would **love** to discuss about these opinions in the comments as well. 
So here it goes:

**First:**  *Snoke dying so early.* Don't get me wrong, i believe that the way Kylo killed Snoked was really clever and gave further insight into Kylo's mind. The thing that bummed me is that we didn't get to see more of Snoke. He had only some minutes of screen time in TFA and TLJ. In these scenes, although of really old aged and clearly scarred and injured, he seemed extremely powerful and menacing. My guess is that we are going to get a book about him and his past. However, I believe that the writers killed him off really quickly. I think the movie could add some additional footage of him, like him showcasing more of his powers and his use of the force,  or a scene were we get an insight on his leadership as supreme leader (or even something hinting his past, idk). My point is that **I** (and many people, as far as I understood) were really excited to see more of Snoke in this film, since the previous film made an impressive job of giving Snoke very little screen time and shrouding his past-identity in secrecy, while simultaneously making him come off as some kind of an ancient, powerful villain that was greatly feared, both by allies and foes. That's why, even though I found his death really cool, I wish we could have some more scenes of him earlier in the movie. 

**Second:** *Phasma versus Finn Battle.* We aren't really sure yet if Phasma is dead or not, since we last saw her falling down in the explosion. We can most certainly assume that she is dead, but we can't be 100% sure about it. Either way, I could not wait to see more of Cpt. Phasma on screen. Dawson's book ""Phasma"" and the previous movie made her look *extremely* badass in my eyes. Moreover, the trailer [1:39,1:44], revealed that there was going to be a fight between her and Finn in the movie. Considering a) the intense close-ups of their battle that were shown on trailer and b) their history, I thought that not only the trailer hinted on a tough battle between these two, but also that TLJ would develop her character a little bit more and give her more screen time. After all, she is really highly ranked in the First Order and a really cool-looking character in general (2 meters, 100 kg, tough demeanor, *shiiiiny armor*). Instead, all we ever got to see was a really disappointing and short-lived encounter between these two, ending abruptly and in a really hasty and undeserved way. As far as I can remember, there weren't any other Phasma related scenes (apart from maybe a handful of really short scenes that weren't really important neither to the movie nor to her character development). So yeah, that is the second ""death"" that really bummed me off. What is funny is, as far as I remember, when TLJ was released, they stated that the second movie would have much more of Captain Phasma than the first one did...

These are my general, summarized thoughts about these two specific plot points in the movie. I am looking forward to seeing your opinions about them!

Why Rouge One is better than The Last Jedi: spoilers,"Both movies seem to deal with the idea of hope as one of their themes. 

In the Last Jedi, failure is a predominant part of the film. However, the characters continue to believe that Leia’s allies will come, that hope and the force will be enough. Poe fails to understand basic leadership skills. Luke has lost hope in the force, himself as a Jedi master. The people some where lost hope in rebellion as a functioning government an have allowed Snoke and Kylo Ren to take hold as a political power and are now demoralizing the “rebellion.” Hope is gone. 

Despite the lack of a Jedi fight, I feel Rouge uses the idea of hope/force themes more accurately. As our characters struggle to not only trust each other but hope what they are doing is not only right. This forces them trust something bigger which moves from a rag tag group of troops to a rebellion; which in the final scenes feels like a force. 

In TLJ the loss of life felt without purpose. I was mad when Luke died, pissed when they killed Snoke, and wishing Rose had died in the first moment I met her. 

When the characters in Rouge One died it felt purposeful which generated a successful ending to great story.

Unanswered TFA questions that bother me in TLJ,"I don't care at all that Snoke died without learning about him. I don't care the Rey's parents are nobodies. I did think she was a Skywalker, but not being one doesn't hurt my feelings towards TLJ.

What does bother me is the unanswered questions TFA poses and TLJ ignores.

Why is there a map to Luke if he never intended to be found?

Why is the Falcon on Jakku (with the map and Rey)?

Why does Artoo have the rest of the map and stay in standby mode until Rey shows up?

Why is Luke's old lightsaber with Maz?

What training did Snoke complete with Kylo? His last order was for Hux to return with Kylo to complete that training. 

It just seems like TFA is one giant coincidence after another. I don't buy that as what JJ intended. 

I think he intended this to be Luke setting all this in to motion. Rey escapes Jakku with the map on the Falcon to lead her to Han who takes her to Maz to get the saber and then to meet Leia &amp; Artoo to combine the map. Luke would want to stop Kylo and Snoke not leave the galaxy to be conquered by these two. I can see him not wanting to do the fighting and we certainly didn't need Luke in action. These are about the new characters after all. I think JJ intended her to be trained by Luke. 

When did the order to return with Kylo change to be ""attack the resistance base""?

It seemed like the foreshadowing for what came next was to be these two young force users being trained and how that training differed. That's what I was excited for based on what I was shown from TFA. TLJ just took all that and threw it out the window. ",StarWars,True,1514055936,2017-12-23

The TLJ Cave and the Trap of the Dark Side (with help from the RotS novelization),"I keep seeing posts and replies talking about how the dark side cave scene is about how Rey shouldn't actually care who her parents are because she's free to write her own destiny. I think this misses the point, and with a little help from the amazing RotS novelization hopefully you will too. 


&gt;""You killed her because, finally, when you could have saved her, when you could have gone away with her, when you could have been thinking about her, you were thinking about *yourself*...it is in this blazing moment that you finally understand the trap of the dark side, the final cruelty of the Sith - because now your *self* is all you will ever have."" &gt;Darth Vader realizing he's killed Padme and lost everything, from the Revenge of the Sith novelization


The dark side is a trap. It seduces you by promising that through its power you can achieve your desires. If you cut yourself off from everything good in life by twisting yourself through hateful thoughts and actions, it gives you the power and helps you move closer and closer to your goal. Finally though, when you're there at the moment you sacrificed everything for, about to get exactly what you wanted after all this darkness...you fail. Your self - the self you clawed as much power to as possible, the self you twisted into something monstrous - is rendered utterly alone and then extinguished. Maul trained all his life to kill Jedi knights and was cut in half by a padawan. Palpatine, after manipulating a galaxy and destroying the Jedi, was thrown to his death by the man he manipulated before he could kill the last Jedi. Anakin, after sacrificing everything for the power to save Padme, kills her in a rage and becomes Vader. The dark side is a trap. It does not fulfil what it promises.


What Rey experienced in the dark side cave had nothing to do with her parents. It was the perfect symbol of the journey that the dark side offers. You bend the Force to your self and it expands your powers in a way that feels good - Rey clearly slightly enjoys having infinite selves directing all of them in clicking in time. You're trapped with only your self and your quest for power, but this doesn't panic you - you're moving towards your goal, you're stronger than ever! Once you reach the goal, it will all have been worth it. 


But you never reach your goal. It's always just out of reach - just one more evil action, just one more hateful thought, just one more cruelty for the sake of power. Each step to exult and empower your self and your personal goals further traps you in a lonely, monstrous quest. Each of the Reys in the queue is a little more trapped than the last. If you ever could reach the front of that endless queue of the self, the self which you have cut off from all others, which you are trapped in forever, you won't find the goal you set out for. No matter how desperately you fight or beg, at the end of your journey you won't find the desires you coveted. The dark side will mock you by bringing shadows of what you desire tantalisingly close but ultimately you will only find your final, ruined self staring back at you. **A cold, frost-covered, broken mirror which offers only a reflection is the perfect symbol of the trap of the dark side, and its final cruelty.** It is exactly what Anakin experiences as he reaches out for Padme after waking as Vader and finds only himself. It is what Luke experiences on Dagobah, killing Vader only to find he will take his place. If you walk down this path, your self is all you will ever have.   ",StarWars,True,1514056689,2017-12-23

"Disney isn't ruining Star Wars, but the internet might be.","It seems like so many ""star wars fans"" didn't go into TLJ to see a Star Wars movie, but instead to mark off their checklist of what their expectations are. I for one am so excited to have star wars back in my life. It was such a huge part of my childhood and now it feels like it's a Christmas present to myself every year. But so many people want to complain about how the movie wasn't made the way they wanted it to be, it makes a lot of discussions not fun. I don't want to go into a thread filled with loaded questions and hear about how stupid Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams are and how Disney is ruining the franchise.

How did Finn and Rose...,"...get back to the rebel base? They crashed 10 meters away from the first order. Did the entire first order force, several AT-AT's, just watch them as Finn dragged Rose's body all the way back to the base and did nothing? Not even wasting a single shot? Wasn't there a single ground trooper to shoot at them?

Did they all just watch while Kylo fought against Luke, not wasting any ammunition on those two rebels?",StarWars,True,1514058684,2017-12-23
The Legend of Luke Skywalker - An Observation (SPOILERS),"Something I noticed the other day when was discussing the film with a friend.

When Luke fights Kylo Renn at the end of the film, he an illusion made by Luke all the way from Ahch To. He did so to by Leia and the rest of the resistance time to escape just as Rey arrived.

But Luke mentions earlier in the film in a pivotal scene, talking about ""The Legend of Luke Skywalker"" and how he could do no wrong and never fail and how he even believed in his own hubris.

I think him fighting Kylo Renn is the literal version of that legend. He shows up out of nowhere, fights impossible odds and ""defeats"" the bad guys. The resistance has never seen him until now and are awestruck by his appearance. He kinda looked like Chuck Norris upon second viewing.

The illusion he created is the illusion that the other characters see as Luke and the one we the audience have created in our heads. The one the legends will remember him for. His illusion is meant to inspire us to do great things and become better. It is the version of Luke we tell in stories to our friends, but this film chose to show us Luke Skywalker the man, the one who is haunted by his mistakes and is broken shell of himself (He is almost the personification of the films main themes in a way). The Illusion is what inspires us. This is then shown in example with the kid at the end using the force on the broom.

A hero can come from anywhere, all he/she needs is a push to get them on their journey.

Just my two cents on it. I've seen a few posts/ comments saying similar stuff.",StarWars,True,1514058927,2017-12-23

[Spoiler] Thoughts on Snoke in TLJ,"For me, the biggest surprise in The Last Jedi was the suddenness of Snoke's death - not only in the second movie but only about halfway through it, and in a rather quick twist.  I almost had to pick my jaw up off the floor of the theatre.

There is an aspect of this that only came to me later, though.  By all appearances and the admittedly curious theories about Plagueis aside, Snoke is not a Sith Lord per se and did not appear to have any interest in continuing that lineage.  Yet he hoped for Kylo Ren to be another Darth Vader, and in an ironic way he got what he wanted.  The apprentice killing the master and seeking a new apprentice is precisely the Sith modus operandi.  And while Kylo said he wanted to leave the Sith in the past along with the Jedi, his actions in murdering his boss and immediately seeking his own apprentice were the very stereotype of a Sith Lord.",StarWars,True,1514059890,2017-12-23
About a lightsaber battle in IX,"*spoilers*

I've been thinking that we didn't exactly get a lightsaber vs lightsaber battle in VIII (the only clash was in the flashback). So I'd think we could get one on IX. (not complaining, I enjoyed all the lightsaber scenes in this movie nonetheless)

But right now the only ones to yeld them in SW are Rey and Ben and I'm not sure they'll want fight each other on IX - they'll possibly be forced to though (?). He at least, doesn't seem to be able to hurt Rey.

What do you guys think? 

Or maybe they'll just team up again, which I wouldn't mind because it worked wonderfully. They seem to be in absolute sync without ever having fought together, which makes me think that they're actually meant to.

Also I don't believe that even if there is a time gap that there will be more lightsaber users. It'll probably be 3 years or so, I believe but I could be wrong on that.",StarWars,True,1514060002,2017-12-23

[spoilers] Episode 9 predictions/ideas.,"This was meant to be a short thread about a few of my hopes and predictions for episode 9, but I accidentally wrote what is basically a rough story draft for the entire movie. (Being concise has never been one of my strengths ;p)  
It’s way too specific, to the point where most of the predictions are unlikely to come true, but I figured that I’d post it anyway. I think that some of the basic story beats and thematic elements could possibly still be fairly accurate though.  

First of all, I’m expecting there to have been a fairly long time skip, a few months at least, but it could be as much as a year or two.  
The rest of my initial predictions are covered in my made up opening crawl which is almost guaranteed to be completely wrong.  

**Opening crawl:**

*It is a dark time for the galaxy. Having taken control over the First Order, SUPREME LEADER Kylo Ren and his KNIGHTS OF REN have conquered most of the galaxy.*  

*But there is HOPE! The SPARK of the Resistance has not been extinguished, and our heroes are trying their best to light the FIRE to burn the First Order down!*  

*Having completed the first steps of her Jedi training, Rey is now helping the Resistance escort new recruits to their stronghold…*  

**Act 1:**  

* The movie opens with Rey and Poe, Rey piloting the Falcon and Poe piloting an X-Wing, maybe there's a few more freighters/transports and a few more X-Wings.  
Rey is using the Falcon to transport some new recruits, while Poe is escorting her.  
(It's also possible that Rey is flying an X-Wing as well, and that Chewie is flying the Falcon by himself.)  
They're attacked by the First Order, but they fight them off and escape by jumping to lightspeed, they show off some good teamwork here which shows that they've gotten along since their first meeting at the end of ep 8, and which also shows that a bunch of time has passed.  

* Cut to Finn, maybe with Rose.  
They are on a diplomatic mission, also to recruit new members for the Resistance.  
They are on some alien planet, with a warrior species that will be very useful for the Resistance, but that is somewhat eccentric and hard to work with.  
(They could be using C3PO as a translator.)  
This gives Finn a chance to show how much he's changed, because he will have to argue in favor of the Resistance and in favor of standing up to the First Order, something that he struggled with in the first two movies.  
Eventually they manage to convince this faction/star system to join the Resistance, they do some more eccentric stuff for one more bit of humor, and we cut to the next scene.  

* Now cut to a scene with Kylo, showing what the First Order is up to.  
They're beginning or preparing a big battle against some of the holdouts on the front lines of the invasion, also featuring the Knights of Ren.  
Show that they're planning to be extra cruel and aggressive, in an attempt to make sure that the main Resistance &amp; Rey show up.  
(Somehow confirm that the Knights of Ren are Luke's old students that joined Kylo, or just show that they're force sensitive and let the audience fill in the gaps.)  
Now cut back to Rey and Poe, arriving at the main Resistance base at around the same time as Finn and Rose, the Resistance is noticeably larger, and overall there's a fairly positive attitude.  
They reference a mission that Leia is on, to also recruit a bunch of new people. (No need to kill her off if you simply increase the size of the Resistance and have her help off-screen! Personally, I prefer Leia being alive off-screen, over Leia being killed off-screen or killed with CGI.)  
But for now, they all get word of the battle that Kylo is in, and get sent in to reinforce.  
This is where things go wrong, and get a bit more negative. It also marks the end of the first act.  

**Act 2:**  

* They are too late and unable to turn the tide of the battle, but they are able to help evacuate many of the survivors. (This fits with the theme of TLJ about focusing on protecting what you love, rather than fighting what you hate.)  
Also, during the fight the most memorable Resistance fighter is killed before Rey's eyes, perhaps he was the Sergeant who was leading the initial defense or something like that, just a minor character who was filmed so that the audience recognized him and sympathized with him.  
This scene also gives Rey a chance to show off her new Jedi skills, she could even fight one or several of the Knights of Ren, but that one guy will die in a way that shows she still has some shortcomings as a Jedi.  
(Rey does not have a new lightsaber yet BTW, she fights with a staff and a blaster.)  
The survivors will talk about how they can't believe that the legend about Rey was real, and about how grateful they are for her help!  
(Kylo will be there at the battle, but he will be too far away to confront Rey before she escapes again.)  

* When they return from the battle, Rey splits off from the rest of the characters, because it's time for her to continue her training.  
(Show how she had been putting up an overly positive facade this whole time, and show it drop away as soon as she splits off from the main group.)  
She finds some secluded area (possibly something that reminds her of Jakku) and contacts Luke, she asks him for advice on the war, on the force, on being a Jedi, etc.  
She's distraught about the scale and destruction of the conflict, and about how much all of these soldiers look up to her and how much pressure this puts on her.  
Luke gives some awesome sage advice, about knowing what you're fighting for, and about how the old Jedi Order failed in this respect due to their dogmatic rules about attachments hindering their ability to feel compassion. (Maybe Yoda or Obi-Wan chime in for this part.)  
Yada yada yada, Rey still hasn't fully learned her lesson, but we cut back to what Kylo is up to.  

* Kylo is consolidating his power, oppressing some recently conquered citizens while also putting Hux or some other officers in their place for their failure to kill Rey and prevent the evacuation.  
Maybe focus on the resentment that these citizens and these officers feel, just to show the contrast with the gratefulness and unity within the Resistance, and to show that rebellion is brewing everywhere.  
This is also really the moment when we confirm that Kylo has become a proper villain, he's just pure evil, redemption is out of the question, and he's become much more confident as well as the new Supreme Leader.  

* Cut back to Rey, Luke sends her away to a planet with kyber crystals, probably some planet that he found while looking for the first Jedi Temple.  
However, this planet is now controlled and ravaged by the First Order, so Rey needs to sneak onto the surface.  
She helps the natives in some small way, and then with the help of a native orphan kid (who turns out to be force sensitive) Rey finds a kyber crystal and she uses it to finish her lightsaber [in that awesome way we saw in TCW.](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121118234621/starwars/images/2/2d/LightsaberConstruction-SWE.jpg)  
(Personally I want it to be a saber-pike, or maybe it's simply integrated into a new staff that she's been using throughout the movie so far.)  
Don’t know what color it should be, yellow maybe?  
(The reason why it takes this long for her to get a new lightsaber is because up until this point she's been conflicted about how to reconcile her idealism with the gritty reality of war, but her small act of kindness made her remember what she is really fighting for, and is essentially what makes her ready to complete her journey towards becoming a Jedi.)  

* Anyway, we now cut back to the Resistance, first of all we hear some more foreshadowing about the reinforcements/allies that Leia is gathering.  
Then we hear about the First Order's next target, which is really my master stroke: The target is Kashyyyk!  
The Wookiees are a warrior species, so obviously they're still putting up a fight.  
But more importantly, this way we get the battle that we were originally supposed to get in ROTJ! I actually like Ewoks, but a final battle with the Wookiees would be amazing!  
Maybe the First Order was working on some project on Kashyyyk, but the Wookiees beat them back, and now the First Order is returning with reinforcements.  
What's important is that for some reason or another, the battle of Kashyyyk will be set up to be a decisive battle, maybe simply for no other reason than Kylo wanting to fully kill off his past by destroying Chewie's home planet, or maybe just because they're one of the strongest member planets of the Resistance, possibly a bit of both.  
Chewie goes to help his kin right away, the rest of the Resistance starts the preparations and plans to get there as soon as possible as well.  

* Back to Rey, she promises to come back to help the kid and the natives even more, but for now she must leave to go help the Resistance again, because she can sense that Kylo is about to launch a major attack.  

**Act 3:**  

* Cut back to the Resistance, this is the third and final act.  
They're going over their battle plan and are preparing to leave when Rey shows up, she talks a bit with Finn and Poe, but then they all leave on their mission.  
(Focus a bit on the recruits that Rey and Finn have brought, just to make the newly recruited factions feel a bit more real and significant.)  

* Now there's the final battle scene, I'm not going to describe all the pew pew noises and explosions through text, but the basic gist of it is that it's a really big battle, the Resistance fleet is in space to protect the planet (with Poe in charge), but the First Order dropships and walkers and everything still make it down to the surface, in the same kind of attack that we saw a few times in TCW.  
So, it's the classic big battle that switches between space-fights and ground-fights, and of course a duel between Rey and Kylo.  Maybe Chewie gets to kick some Knight of Ren ass, Rey probably fights some of them as well before fighting Kylo.  

* The basic meaning/theme of the battle will be that it focuses on the unity, teamwork, and diversity of the Resistance, on all the different groups and species that are gathered together and working together.  
Also, maybe Chewie gets wounded and Finn patches him up again, could be a fun callback to TFA, and of course since it's Chewie's home-planet everyone is afraid that he'll die. (But he won’t because I don't want him to!!)  

* It starts to look like they're losing the fight, but then Leia's reinforcements show up, and they're led by Lando! (With Nien Numb by his side.)  
The tide turns, comradely overcomes evil fascism, bla bla bla, and as the tide turns Rey begins to overpower Kylo, who is suddenly completely outnumbered, wounded, and alone.  
Rey gives him a chance to surrender, but he stubbornly refuses, and when he attacks Rey kills him with a quick and decisive counterattack.  
(This might be a bit too brutal, but she could cut his face in half where she scarred him in TFA.)  
Everyone celebrates, the day is won, all is good. During the celebrations Lando brags about his experience with running Cloud City, and they hint at how he'll help rebuild the Republic.  

* The First Order army isn't completely wiped out, they've simply retreated, but they make it clear that rebellions are popping up all over the place and that the First Order's days are numbered. Maybe even cut to how those citizens that Kylo was oppressing suddenly rise up and fight against the First Order.  
Then they show General Hugs being in command of what's left, show how pathetic he is for being so happy with what will be a very brief command.)  

* Rey returns to the planet where she got her kyber crystal.  
She keeps her promise, helps the natives, and the force sensitive kid is the first young Padawan of the new Jedi Order!  

* The end...

**A few additional notes, and a few more general predictions for the themes that I feel are more likely to pan out:**  

* You may have noticed, but Rey's side story would be a parallel to what her parents did to her, except Rey really did come back!  
They could even make it very obvious, by making the scene where Rey leaves that force sensitive kid behind very similar to the flashback where Rey is abandoned by her parents.  
The rest of her story is about having trouble facing the brutal reality of war, which I think fits with her character arc in episodes 7 &amp; 8, because especially episode 8 was basically about Rey having all of her naive hopes and dreams crushed, first about Luke and then about Kylo.  

* Finn's story arc is mostly just in the first act of the movie, where he proves that he's now a true Resistance fighter who believes in the cause and is ready to fight the First Order, by convincing others to join the fight as well.  
After that he's mostly just a soldier and a badass without much of a continued character arc, he simply puts his money where his mouth is.  

* Poe's character arc is simply that he proves that he's become a better leader, he's perfectly willing to be defensive and to retreat in that first scene, he shows improvement in the strategy sessions but still struggles a bit, then he ultimately proves himself as he commands the Resistance fleet above Kashyyyk.  
Also, and this is completely optional, but I feel like there could be a love story between Rey and Poe.  
For no particular reason, other than that I kind of felt a chemistry during their meeting in episode 8, and that I feel like a romantic relationship for Rey would be a good thing for reasons I’ll expand upon below.  
They could bond during their shared piloting mission (while showing that they've already bonded off screen) and perhaps over their somewhat similar struggles with leadership and responsibility.  

* This relationship would also show that some changes will be made to this new Jedi Order, and that attachments will be more accepted. (Just not selfish attachments that make you do stupid and evil stuff.)  
Which actually makes it pretty important, because I can't really think of another way to show that the Jedi Order has really changed and that it has learned from its mistakes.  

Again, many of the specific predictions probably won’t come true, but I had fun writing it and I’d like to hear your thoughts, or your predictions for Episode 9.

Poe was threatening to pretty much sabotage her plan to save people and instead of doing everything she can to stop him, she just tells him ""I hope you understand what you’re doing"". Nothing else. Instead of trying to reason with him she recklessly played a hero and bet the fate of the crew on her escape, which ultimately worked, but were the mutineers a little more competent a stunned her, her plan would fail and all the people would die.

But there's something that still bugs me: on TFA Kylo is really obsessed with Vader, and wants to ""continue what he started"", by exterminanting the Jedi and whatever. Only in ROTJ Vader was the reason why Luke (and the Jedi through him) lived. We have to assume that while being raised, Leia and Luke have told him over and over the story of how his grandfather was redeemed.

My second time watching TLJ.,"I'll be honest. The first time I watched the movie I was disappointed. I didn't like it and reconsidered my fandom.

That changed today. I went in with a cleared mind and watched it for what it was and I really enjoyed it. It still doesn't make up for TFA but I have completely reversed my stance.

Here are some things for you incase you haven't gone back yet but was curious:

The little boy at the end definitely uses the force to grab the broom. Super subtle though.

Someone on here commented about ""Rey taking the books from the ancient temple"" and I totally thought it was just rumor mill because we never saw it but very quickly at the end I was caught with a pleasant surprise. Finn is digging through something on the Millennium Falcon and for literally 10 frames you see the books heavily shrouded. This made me excited.

The Finn and Rose story was still kinda extra but it wasn't as bad the first time. However I wonder if Finn is going to reject her because she kissed him and told him she loved him but he was like...ehhh...(still think him and Poe will get together).

Anyway I thoroughly enjoyed the movie The second time around. I'm excited for what's next. I enjoyed Ren better understanding his struggle with the dark side as it truly is how the dark side works.",StarWars,True,1514061706,2017-12-23
My thoughts after finally seeing The Last Jedi...,"I went to go see it last night with seven friends of mine. All of us were seeing it for the first time. To give a bit of context, we liked The Force Awakens, even though we thought it had a bit too much repeating of ANH, and we kinda disliked Rogue One. We had been hearing that TLJ was a rather polarizing movie with half of people liking it and the other half hating it, but that critics overwhelmingly enjoyed it. 

Naturally, we went in cautiously but we were, nonetheless, very excited to see what the film had in store.

We loved it. Honestly, we walked out of the theatre thinking that was a fantastic movie and one of, if not the, best movies in the entire saga. Now, I can't speak for the rest of them, but let me tell you why I really enjoyed The Last Jedi.

First of all, I loved the fact that the film took serious risks with the Star Wars mythos surrounding the force and the jedi and introduced some ambiguity into the equation. Traditionally, Star Wars has been a very black and white tale. You're either good or you're bad. Light or dark. Jedi or Sith. This is the first time where Star wars actually questioned that whole dynamic, and approached the fact that its a rather problematic distinction to make. The Jedi aren't infallible. They call themselves the protectors of peace, but they've been responsible for their fair share of fuck ups that have led to tons of death and destruction and misery for the Galaxy. Even Luke acknowledges in this movie that it was Jedi failure, in part anyway, that caused the rise of the Empire. Obviously the Sith aren't nice or anything, but maybe giving in to the Dark side sometimes isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just maybe simply what you use it for. After all, Rey has tapped into the dark side before, quite clearly, and she's not evil. Perhaps this is the dawn of a new era in how people think of the force. Not as light vs dark, but rather as different shades of grey. This is something that I really like, and in the end, it feels like a much more nuanced and mature Star Wars movie.

I loved the way Luke was portrayed. I've been hearing that some people have had problems with the fact that Luke was this crotchety hermit and people think that he gave up too easily. But here's the thing: it's been a few decades since ROTJ. A lot has happened to him in that time, including the fact that he allowed one of his pupils, who is also his nephew, to turn to the dark side and kill his other pupils. And this is after he was supposed to be the one to bring balance to the force and that he was this legend that brought Vader back into the light and destroyed the Empire. This shattered that idea. And then I hear people say that it wasn't in Lukes character to try and kill Ben to begin with. But remember, Luke has shown that he has shades of darkness in him, specifically when he lashed out against Vader on the Death Star. And he says that he had it for a glimpse but then realized that he still could have brought Ben back from darkness. No wonder he ran away to a remote planet and didn't want anyone to find him. He has to shoulder the blame for everything wrong thats happened lately. And only when he gets there does he realize that the entire Jedi ideology is inherently flawed, and that is why he does not want it to live on. At least, until the end anyway. And I love the arc his character went through and when he finally died at the end by becoming one with the force, it just felt like such a satisfying end to his character. Probably not *the end* because I'm sure he will make an appearance as a force ghost in the next movie, but still, it felt right. I loved his scenes with Rey. When he threw the lightsaber away at the beginning, I laughed my ass off. It was fantastic. I gotta say though, Mark Hamill absolutely crushed it. Fantastically emotional performance from him, and really pulled off old Luke well. He also had some moments where he seemed like young Luke too, specifically when talking to R2 and when talking to Yoda. Speaking of which...

I loved the Yoda scene. I think we all pretty much agreed that that was one of the best scenes in the movie and honestly, one of the best in the entire saga. I love the fact that they used puppet Yoda too, and that they gave him his personality from the OT of being this cooky but wise creature. Honestly, some of Yoda's lines in that movie were some of the best he's ever said, specifically about how masters always get surpassed by their apprentices or something. That scene just made me smile.

I loved the Rey/Kylo dynamic. I thought it was great how the film had them both kind of figuring out their path with the force together. They were both conflicted, demonstrating that they are some shade of grey jedi, with Rey being lighter and Kylo darker. I liked that the movie used a lot of misdirection with those two by making it seem at various points as if one of them might turn at any moment. I liked the fact that these two could kind of relate to each other, that's really the first time that that's happened in a Star Wars film where the main protagonist and antagonist could understand what the other was thinking. And I absolutely loved when they kicked ass together in Snokes throne room. That scene was awesome.

I loved that fact that Rey is her own character and not Luke's kid or Han and Leia's kid something like that. For the last two years, was I the only one who thought that would have been the dumbest thing ever? I like the fact that this film branched out by just making her a nobody with nobody parents. The story would have felt so unnecessarily contained if they just kept her in the Skywalker lineage.

The scene where the cruiser hyperdrives into Snokes ship: spectacular. That was one of the most breathtaking moments in Star Wars. I could hear an audible gasp in the theatre, that was so awesome.

There were just a few that bothered me a little bit but not enough to make me not like the film as much:

* The Canto Bight sequence. It just felt very side-questy and tacked on. It could be that maybe it's going to be used to set up future jedi, like the kids on the planet with their rebel alliance ring, but it felt like it didn't really belong in Star Wars as much. I think what took me out of it a bit was the stylistic choice. The casino setting looked way too much like a movie like Casino Royale or Oceans Eleven or something. It looked too much like the real world to me.

* Although I liked most of the humor in the movie, there were two bits that I thought were dumb. The first was in the beginning when Poe calls Hux, and then the other was when Luke told Rey to reach out and she literally reaches out with her hands. Most of the other jokes were fine, I felt. Star Wars has always had humor in it, after all.

* Leia flying back to the ship felt really weird. My honest thoughts when that happened were ""Oh, is this why some people hate this movie?"". I understand that they wanted to showcase Leia actually using her force abilities but it just seemed kinda silly. Also since she's still alive but Carrie Fisher unfortunately isn't, are they going to have to a pretty big time skip for the next one in which she dies off screen? They already said no CGI Leia. My guess is this is probably what the plan was and when she died they couldn't recut the movie in a way where Leia dies but the rest of the film still works. RIP Admiral Ackbar though

* I think it would have been cool if Finn did end up sacrificing himself at the end there. I felt it was a bit of a cop out. It would have been a nice arc to his character and it would have felt more like the Resistance really lost something in this film. I mean, granted, they did. They only have like 20 people left. But this way it would have felt like a much bigger loss.

* This movie did make Snoke into a rather pointless character. I mean, there was some build up as to who he was and it's never revealed and then he's killed off. Granted, in a cool fashion. But still, if you're going to have this new character that's evil and powerful and rebuilt the empire, but you're never going to give any backstory into who he was or how he found Ben Solo, it just ends up turning him into a cardboard cut-out waste of a villain. I suppose he's just there to set up Kylo Ren as the ultimate baddie, but that remains to be seen after Episode IX.

Ultimately, I really enjoyed this movie. It has some of the best character development that a Star Wars movie has ever seen, and it breaks the mold of Star Wars by exploring some cool, interesting and new ideas. Star Wars has to evolve over time. New elements of the force have to be brought into the equation and old rules might have to be broken. I think this film did a lot of that but in a good way. 

Film is incredibly subjective, and if you didn't like it for whatever reason, that's fine. No, it's not perfect by any stretch, but what Star Wars film is? With a film like this, it's impossible to please everybody. Rian Johnson could have just made a Star Wars film that did not do anything new and was safe and felt exactly like Empire Strikes Back, but he didn't. He decided to challenge the mold and take Star Wars where it hasn't gone before. Ultimately, I think it's a really good move on his part, and one that will pay off over time. I honestly do feel that once the dust settles on this current crop of Star Wars movies, people will probably look back on this one as the best one.

Plus, the way Rey stared means she's feeling some kind of way about it. 

Kylo Ren and her appear to be more about sexual tension, I could see Rey be attracted to the wild, sexual mystique of Kylo Ren, yet I prefer the endearing reparte between Rey and Finn.

"[Theory] Princess Leia has been Vader's Spy since childhood, is now currently Master of the Sith, and has spent the last 2 movies being pursued by her apprentice: Snoke.","All due respect to our Princess Carrie Fisher, but I feel it is finally time to out Princess Leia for the true sith mastermind she is.

Consider this, Princess Leia was co-opted by the Emperor as a teenager, and was acting as a saboteur and informant for the Emperor.  Furthermore, she was recruited through Vader, who offered her the same deal as Luke: ""Work with me and we'll rule the galaxy"".  After the original trilogy, she was the first Supreme Leader of the new republic where she took up her apprentice Snoke who is now using any means necessary to kill her and become a Sith Master himself.

As proof, lets consider the facts. 

1.  At birth, Obiwan &amp; Yoda both agreed they needed to hide Luke &amp; Leia.  Obiwan went to a remote system and used the force to hide Luke's potential.  Leia was given to Bail Organa to hide in plain sight.  Even if her true heritage was discovered, Papatine/Vader would be foolish to murder the daughter of such a prominent figure in galactic politics.  

1. However, it's easy to assume that through the force or conventional spycraft that Palpatine and/or Vader know Padme had the children, and that one of them is Bail Organa's ""daughter"".  I mean come on, the guy is a galactic senator and just pops up with a kid and no bullshit ""First Lady Baby Shower"" type politicization? Nobody knew Ms. Organa was pregnant or they were adopting? Had to take about 5 minutes of research to see through that bullshit. 

2. Vader allows his daughter to be raised by Bail Organa, who will imbue her with skills in political maneuverings, diplomacy, and a general inter-galactic political knowledge. As the daughter of a galactic VIP it's easy to assume she will be trained in self-defense, how to read a bad situation and get herself out of a kidnapping situation.  This will make her an easy recruitment target for the Rebel Alliance, as Vader knows Bail is no fan of the Empire, and she's already halfway to spy by space high school.  Vader and/or his agents get to her discreetly in high school and offer her a job in the family business: Being a Sith Apprentice. 

2. By the time of Rogue One, Leia is well planted in the Rebel Alliance leadership circles, and actively feeding Vader basic intel.  She's already famously blown up key relationships between the larger rebel cells such as Saw Gerrerra's gang, preventing the alliance from truly uniting.  On orders from Vader, she encourages the scattered local rebels to band together and take the Empire on head-first, knowing the losses they'd sustain meant the end of any significant resistance. She completes this and the bonus objective of securing the death star plans.  

**A New Hope**

3. After receiving the plans during Rogue One, she is allowed (by Vader) to escape.  They are pulled out of hyperspace at a relatively abandoned desert planet and she immediately chucks the plans crucial to the Rebellion's survival out the nearest airlock.  On the off chance R2 doesn't die in the deserts of Tattooine, she give him the bonus objective of finding one of the last Jedi in the galaxy, so he doesn't just sit, hide, and survive like a logical droid would do. 

4. Vader ""captures"" her for a full debriefing of her first major operation and kills the crew.  While on the Death Star, she completes the Sith Apprentice tradition of murdering something close to you to prove loyalty.  She's asked to remain in-character on the bridge of the Death Star while Vader murders her father.  Being a stone cold Sith Apprentice she completes the task and her training. 

5. Miraculously, R2 finds Obi-Wan, brings him to the death star to be slaughtered by Vader, effectively ending the Jedi Order, as Vader &amp; Palpatine may or may not be aware that Yoda is still alive.  Leia is ""rescued"" by Han &amp; Luke, who already are smelling trap when they're allowed to escape and only see 1 stormtrooper watching this incredibly VIP prisoner. This will allow her to reinsert herself into the Rebel High Command with minimal suspicion, as she is now the only rebel leader to have met Vader and survived.  

6. Upon being rescued, Leia - knowing full well they're being tracked - chooses to fly directly to Yavin, pinpointing the remainder of the rebel alliance for her father and master.  If she was truly concerned with the fate of the Alliance, she instead would have transmitted the plans wirelessly, as they were received in Rogue One, or via an agent, or fucking space wikileaks.  She was consciously leading the empire to the Rebel base and surviving leadership.  

7. However, Leia realizes that Vader will not hesitate to put her on the business end of a Death Star, and commits her first betrayal to her father: She helps the Rebel Alliance actually blow up the death star.  The plan *was* for a ground assault, but turns out Vader lies and/or Tarkin pulled rank.  This is also why Vader doesn't kill Luke and makes sure he's off the Death Star when it blows.  He could sense danger and blasters from every direction like, 3 days ago (Rogue One) but Han Solo and the Falcon could sneak up on him? Bullshit, he let it happen. Vader needs his apprentice to help overthrow his master. 

8. Vader survives, Leia's cover is somehow intact, as folks are so high on winning that they forget to ask why the fuck she couldn't have just space-emailed them the fucking plans. 

**Empire Strikes Back**, *the most damning*. 

9.  Rebels are now setup on Hoth.  Someone needs to install sensors all over the place for security.  It could be any number of redshirts, but Leia volunteers two of the rebellion's greatest heroes to go out ON FOOT to plant these things all over one of the most inhospitable planets in the galaxy.  

10.  When Luke is discovered to be left behind, Han goes out to save him like a total bro.  Come nightfall, they're forced to close the blast doors.  Leia cries crocodile tears.  Her plan almost succeeds in killing at least Luke, but again Han's dumb fucking luck saves the day.  

11. Meanwhile, Vader is throwing out false flag probe droids, as Leia has already given him everything he needs to pinpoint the rebel bases.  He was merely waiting for enough of their VIP's to be present for an assault.  

12. Before the assault, Leia sends out their greatest hero and smuggler to ""check out"" the probe droids.  This is virtually suicide, because it's fucking more than freezing outside, there's yeti's, and the droid itself has guns and bombs.  She was actively trying to kill the Alliance's greatest heroes to devastate morale before a clinch battle.  Again, nobody asks why she didn't send a fucking red shirt to check that stuff out. 

9.  Han &amp; Luke survive again, but the rebel base is adequately destroyed, and the alliance is scattered to the wind.  Under the pretense of being a heroic leader and waiting for the last transport, Leia's actual plan was to to be picked up by Daddy for a full debriefing before being ""rescued"" back to the alliance again, but instead was ""rescued"" by Han and spirited off the planet.  

10. Vader, needing the information she has, immediately pursues the Falcon.  They could have blasted the ship from with the Star Destroyer's main cannons, but Vader needs them alive, so it's fighters only.  

11.  In perhaps the most damning move, just as Han says ""Deflectors aren't going to hold for long"" (indicating shields are still up and no real damage has been taken),  Leia comes from the back of the ship and notes that a that Star Destroyer is gonna get them and Han should GTFO.  He says ""Watch this"" and the hyperdrive immediately fails.  Fast forward a couple of scenes, and a seemingly minor part has been de-polarized, despite the ship taking no real damage. 

12. Despite Leia sabotaging the hyperdrive, Han again lucks out through the asteroid field to effect repairs.  While he's fixing the depolarized coupler, she's in the engine room welding...something.  Han comes back to ask her what she's doing and she immediately starts making out with him before he notices she's broken something else.  

13.  Which is handy when Han thinks he's fixed the problem, leaves the asteroid field, and finds the hyperdrive STILL doesn't work, but for different reasons this time.  He's too busy figuring a new plan to put the situation together.  

14.  They miraculously get away and make it to Bespin, where conveniently Vader has arrived ""Just before they got there"".  Lando's no snitch, but Leia is.  Or Boba Fett.  She may be cleanish on this one.  

15.  When Vader invites Han &amp; Leia for teatime with Daddy Han's quick to draw down, but Leia's completely ambivalent.  This is all according to plan for her.  She knows Vader is there to ""capture"" and debrief her again after the Hoth mission.  

16. While on Bespin, Han is interrogated for funsies (""They didn't even ask me any questions"") and Leia is told about Death Star 2.0 and Vader's final plan for Endor and killing his Master for a round of Sith Promotions.  

16.  In a move that's going to be tough to explain to the Alliance, she is allowed to leave with Lando, someone with enough credibility to re-insert her into the remaining shreds of the Alliance. To further build her (what must be) tarnished credibility (given that she's met Vader twice and lived) she rescues the now debilitated Luke, to buy her way back into Alliance good graces. This is not in Vader's plans, and this begins to sow distrust for her going off book, as it is her second strike as a double agent. 

**Return of the Jedi**

11.  Upon her return to Alliance High Command, she isn't trusted.  She's conveniently dropping off the radar before and after major battles, usually to meet Vader one on one, and always with a crazy escape story.  She is literally the only rebel leader to personally meet with Vader and survive encounter - and has done so at least twice.  To prove her worth, she is put back on secret agent duty, with minimal access to Alliance movements and given the mission to rescue Han Solo - Rebel Hero from the Hutts.  

12.  With her out of Alliance central command, the Alliance hits it's stride.  For whatever reason shit just starts to work out, everyone gets along and they finally have significant numbers and a unified movement.  Bothans die, Death Star 2.0 is discovered, and it's plans are again made available.  It's almost like a cancer was removed from their diplomatic corps...   

13.  That is, until Leia returns with Han, Luke, and the gang in tow.  Leia also capitalized on Luke's time over the period of 2-3 years to keep him focused on the search for Han instead of going back to Dagobah to complete his training.  

13.  Leia, now with some command authority thanks to her ""successful"" rescue mission, encourages the rebel fleet to take on the Death Star directly, knowing full well it's a trap.  Expecting total annihilation of all space forces, she immediately volunteers for commando duty, which is easily approved given her field experience.  

14.  Knowing she's at the end of her embedment, Leia is planning to meet up with Vader to take her place at the right and of the soon-to-be Sith Lord, as she feels they can use the impending Rebel attack on the death star to finally take out Vader's master Palpatine so she can become a full apprentice to her Father, the newly crowned Sith Lord. To her, extraction is clearly the only reason Vader would be on Endor's surface. 

15.  Han &amp; Chewie use the stolen shuttle and codes to land on Endor, and someone needs to be sent out to scout.  Is it any of the dozen redshirts? Nope.  Lets take the entire command team out to go scout the area teeming with stormtroopers a day or two before the biggest operation in rebel history.  I'm sure the grunts in the shuttle will figure out what the plan is eventually. 

16.  ""Surprisingly"" they're all ambushed by stormtroopers.  Again, Han brazens his way through certain death, and kills most of them.  However, some get away on speederbikes to go for reinforcements.  Leia immediately ""volunteers"" to run them down herself, but Luke hops on to ""help"".  Now she has to actually kill them.  

17.  After the speederbikes, her and Luke are dismounted, and Luke mentions that Vader's on the surface to confront HIM, not pick up Leia.  She now realizes that Vader has finally had it with her going off-script at Death Star 1.0 and Bespin, and that he will likely try to recruit Luke as his new apprentice making her irrelevant.  At this point her plan changes fundamentally, and she makes sure Luke's plan is to go meet Palpatine with Vader on the death star.  

18.  With the current Sith master, his apprentice, her master, and the last of the Jedi on the Death Star, her Sith Master instincts kick in.  Instead of actively sabaotaging the rebel team, she's now fully committed to the mission and works to find a secret shortcut to the shield generator's back door.  

18.  By helping the Rebels blow the death star, she becomes the new Lord of the Sith, and almost scores a critical victory by taking out the Jedi Order along with them.  But still, Leia is now a full-fledged Sith master, after completing the ritual of killing her master.  

**Pre-Force Awakens**

19.  Leia is now a spy working with no handler, and must fully embrace her position as a leader of the alliance.  As a Sith Lord, she helps Mon Mothma be elected space president, with Leia as her VP, reinstating the senate and some form of democracy.  Leia was never the political glue holding everything together.  She'd need Mon Mothma's god-tier diplomacy and connections to actually broker some form of peace between the Empire Remnants and the various Rebel Alliance factions.  

21.  This is not a complete peace.  Some empire die-hards still hold out, and several smaller rebel cells don't consider the peace ""good enough"" and continue to fight.  

20.  With the uneasy peace settled, Mon Mothma trips and falls into some bullets and dies.  Giving Leia the presidency. She selects an upcoming young Senator Snoke from Naboo (because why not) as her VP and recruits him as her apprentice.  Together they establish a new order of the first class in the Galaxy.  

18.  Just like the Emperor, she has rebuilt an empire by playing both sides, controlling the resistance and keeping it weak.  

19. Along the way Luke discovered her secret and doesn't take it well.  Literally every one of his friends and family are dead or have betrayed him.  He can't kill his beloved friend and sister, but sith are bad, right? He chooses to just walk away from everything and exile himself using the occlusion techniques taught to him by Obi-Wan while he decides if he wants to perpetuate the Jedi vs Sith foreverwar, or if by simply walking away there can finally be peace in the galaxy.  Sure freedoms are limited, but under an benevolent emperor, there is no more war and the galaxy fan finally build.

20. During Leia's re-election Snoke runs on a ""Make Space Great Again"" platform, promoting the strength of the First Order and how there is no more war.  He realizes he's ready to take over from Leia, and makes a play at killing her.  However, she's been a galaxy-class spy for 60 goddamn years and knows how to get the fuck outta town. 

**The Force Awakens/The Last Jedi**

22.  Leia is now on the run, and hooks up with a splinter cell of rebels that never gave up the fight.  She's considered a hero and they work to hide her and end Snoke's rule.  

23.  The plot of both movies isn't to end The Resistance, but instead is simply Snoke trying to kill his master: Leia Organa-Skywalker.  The resistance measures in the hundreds. As of TFA, 24 X-Wings is the most they could muster, clearly not a threat to Snoke's endless Star Destroyer fleet.  

24.  However, Leia is.  That's why Snoke doesn't hesitate to deploy his apprentice and a full Star Destroyer fleet against the couple dozen ships The Resistance can carry.  It's why he doesn't hesitate to blow up any planets Leia MIGHT be on with Starkiller Base.  Sith Lords are fucking tough to kill, and he knows she's coming for him.  He doesn't give a shit about the characters, but instead only cares about killing her.  

25. When Kylo kills Snoke, it's not to become a Sith Master, but to fully become Leia's Apprentice.  That is why when The Resistance landed on the Salt Plains, he didn't just nuke them from orbit, but instead ordered a ground assault.  Leia standing by those doors isn't watching out for The First Order, she's outside the bingo hall waiting for her son to pick her up.  

26.  That's why she's ambivalent when Poe is trying to find a way out while Luke is making his sacrifice play.  She's a full-fledged Jedi and could be expected to use the force to guess which tunnel to go down, but instead is just letting the dumbest pilot in the galaxy make the call.  

25.  By the end of TLJ, the rebellion is down to a couple dozen people on the Millenium Falcon, but Leia is still one of them.  She is still the Sith Master but is couch surfing with what can be described as a commando team at best, if not a terrorist cell.  Kylo is now trying to capture and/or kill his mother to become her apprentice and/or the new Sith Master. 

If JJ Abrams wants to have some fun in Ep 9, he could embrace The Resistance for the dozen or so they are, and make it a commando raid mission.  Have Rey kill Leia for her sins listed above, knowingly or not becoming Master of The Sith. The Resistance heroically makes a suicidal commando raid to put Rey in front of Kylo for the big fight.  Rey kills Kylo, becoming Supreme Leader, Sith Master, and the Last of the Jedi all at once.  What she chooses to do with all that point can be explored in Eps 10-12.

"[fan creation] I developed two themes for the athletic association site (my college project), in homage to Star Wars VIII one week ago","Hello,

During 9 months, I wiped out my second version that I built, so I wanted to derive the first version, which was full of bugs, to free all the bugs, rebuild, redesign, sophisticate and gatsby the site, in homage to the original developer, for the third version, in the which I rewrote everything in PHP, translated into English (Canada, Great Britain, United States), French (Belgium, Canada, France, Switzerland), Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal and pan-Lusophone) and Spanish (Argentina, Chile, Latin America and Mexico), I included a virtual assistant similar to Cortana/Siri.

My professors voted my project as the best of my class and I got A+. 

On holidays and before the premiere of Star Wars VIII, I had an idea. I built two themes – Jedi and Sith. 

When you change the theme, the whole site, including the virtual assistant, changes. 

Test the start and sports page. 

On a start page, I redesigned and recoloured the image of artist Craig Drake with background of Coruscant and a droid-like ball. 

Test also the virtual assistant, but unfortunately it is available only in Portuguese, because Flow.ai is very limited. You can copy and paste:

* Oi! (In English: Hi!)
* Quem é Vitor Carrilho? (In English: Who is Vitor Carrilho?)

You can test the official website (except Edge 40, if you use Edge, use Edge 38 and 41): 

http://atleticaunisal.com.br

The athletic association members and president, except the webmaster, approved this version. But my professors didn't know that.

The next year, for my final theory or term paper (because I'll get graduated), I'll keep the themes, expand new features and new options. Soon I'll translate into Catalan, Georgian, German, Greek, Italian and other 5 languages and expand the Cyrillic, Georgian, Greek and pan-European for an open source Star Wars-like font, without forgetting my other useful projects. 

Tell me what you think about the site themes. 

**Observe:** I also made an Artificial Intelligent semester workclass project about “Droid Jess” in the Star Wars style, with audio, animations and code body coloured in An Old Hope highlighting syntax, the which my professor classified as the best of all the semester projects of class, but the project isn't translated into English yet and isn't optimised for mobile phones yet.

Issue with the De-Mythification of Luke,"Deconstructions of Hero characters work better when 
1) It stands up
2) The audience does the myth making

For the first point, what I mean is these Hero is human stories usually work best with stories that are re-tellings or old stories.
But for TIL, The previous films are an issue.
It's like with snoke, people say ""Well you didn't care about the emperor's backstory"", but he wasn't introduced out of nowhere in the 7th movie, where we know the exact state of most of the universe.

In universe Luke could have been blown out of proportion.
But we SAW what he did, movies 4-6 Happened.
We saw him lose his, basically, parents and fight on, we saw him take on, basically, Hitler and turn him good.
He blew up the Death Star, he faced 2 of the strongest sith of the world.

So him going from handling loss heroicly to cowardly, and handling darkness, from almost insane levels of hope to ""Well maybe I should murder my nephew.."", people will be upset.

And as for point 2, the audience didn't build Luke to be a hero like that, Lucas and his company did, the movies did, the EU did especially too.
Killling of the old EU,  then attacking that version of the character, basically, is kinda silly imo.

The thing is I really liked the movie all in all.

Awkward moment in TLJ (Some spoilers),"Let me just make it clear that I loved The Last Jedi. Everything from Hamill's acting to Kylo Ren's rage and the Yoda scene grabbed me, but one small (and I'll admit this is nitpicky) thing I couldn't stop thinking about is a scene with Rey and Luke, where she follows him and says something along the lines of 'Mr. Skywalker, we need your help because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force.' in a very, very awkward manner. Did any of you find this odd, or is it just me?",StarWars,True,1514063632,2017-12-23
Couple things I noticed in second viewing that were great.,"1. When Rey says, “The Galaxy needs a legend” to Luke, he absolutely fulfills that. Our Jedi youngling at the end of the story hears the exact legend of how Luke defeated an army of First Order walkers all by himself. This legend is exactly what everyone not responding to Leia’s distress call need. 

2. When Snoke throws Kylo’s lightsaber back at him, it spins a few times before it comes to a rest. Seeing it a second time, you can see the idea of spinning Anakin’s lightsaber to kill Snoke in Kylo’s eyes. Great foreshadowing.

3. The shot after hyperspace kamikaze might be the best looking scene in Star Wars history. The first time I heard young kids going “woah” when seeing it, but the second time, I heard 40 year old men in awe.

4. Finally, the theme of letting go of the old and reaching out to the new seems way more apparent, especially when Rose tells Finn that we don’t destroy what we hate, but save what we love. 

Much better the second time around.",StarWars,True,1514063656,2017-12-23

The Rebels could have sold Han to Jabba.,"Not sure if this has been mentioned before (knowing Star Wars fans it probably has), but...

I’m rewatching TESB right now and I had a cynical thought. In the beginning when they’re on Hoth, before Luke’s rescue in the snow, Han mentions to the General that he needs to leave before Jabba places a huge bounty on his head. If the rebel’s were truly desperate fighters like in reality, they would imprison him until the bounty is released then sell him for the huge reward. 

In other words, they would do to him the same as Vader/Boba did at the end of the movie. Just a thought. ",StarWars,True,1514063737,2017-12-23
"*SPOILERS* Problem with TLJ isn't what it does, but how it does it.","TLJ makes large changes to the OT themes and characters without a graceful transition or any real exploration of the problems in those themes.  I loved seeing this version of Luke and it was great acting but we never got a believable explanation for how he got there.  It simply tells us that the old ways don't work anymore.  It doesn't show how or why or really say anything other than they failed and now must learn from it.  How did they fail?  What aspects of the jedi led to their vanity?  How does the darkside tempt jedi in training.  Adam driver does a great job of protraying the struggle in Kylo, but we don't have plausible explanations for Kylo's later actions and choices.  We see why he'd hate luke and why he'd hate snoke.  Now that they're both gone, why does this guy want to rule the universe?  What is the nature or the root of the innate darkness in him?  We didn't have this level of depth with the OT villians either but the OT never asks us to look at their point of view.  If we're to sympathize with and understand Kylo, we need more depth to his story and character.

I can forgive the plot holes, wasting of time with uninteresting side plots, and disregarding of the general OT ruleset if it means we get a new story that fleshes out something meaningful.  This movie hints at that, but lacks substance.  To me, the best parts of the movie are Rey's scenes on the island and especially the mirror scene where she's contending with the pull of the dark side.  We see how it temps her with what she wants, her struggle with loneliness and her eventual acceptance of who she is.  Later on when Kylo tempts her, she's prepared for it because of this scene.  That was a great dynamic and it was done in a really cool artistic manner.  Time slowing to the point where a reflection reacts after the original was a beautiful way to showcase the sanity reducing nature of loneliness.  Adding the snap implied that all senses are affected and we really feel for Rey when she's explaining it to Kylo moments later.

Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't hold up.  Let's look at the scene where Kylo reveals her heritage.  First off, I love the idea of Rey's parents being nobodies.  But people keep saying that the moment is brilliantly made better by the subversion of our expectations.  TFA shouldn't have built up these expectations in the first place.  But it did and Rian has to deal with them.  Subverting out expectations here takes us out of the moment.  It actually creates a disconnect between the audience and Rey. We want to know who her parents are because the previous movie hints at them being something special. Rey wants to know because she's lonely and they're her freakin parents.  Kylo tells us that she's looking for her parents in other people like Han and Luke.  Rey tells Luke that the galaxy might need a legend but she just needs someone to show her her place in all of this.  Rey has no expectation for her parents to be someone special. When she finds out who they are, its painful that she was abandoned. Subverting our expectation doesn't help us feel Rey's pain or loneliness. It takes us out of the moment and makes us think about our expectations, which are NOT Rey's expectations. Instead of sympathizing with Rey, we're thinking ""wtf"" in the moment. And after processing it, at best, you can say that it was clever. I'd rather be immersed in the movie, the story and the character.  

Lets compare it to the ESB scene where they subvert our expectations with Luke being Vader's son.  At the end of an emotionally charged fight, Luke has lost his hand and is dangling precariously over an almost literal abyss.  We're in tune with Luke here and feel what he's feeling.  Because we're not wondering who Luke's father is, we're not actively waiting for this moment.  When Vader tells him, we feel exactly what Luke feels.  Disbelief, anger, hopelessness and suffering.  Star Wars has always been about immersion.  We loved the originals because they made us feel like we really were sneaking around a moon-sized battle station, or fighting through the mechanical catacombs of a city in the clouds.  It's that immersion into the fantasy sci-fi world that made the OT special.  We can forgive just about any flaw if a star wars movie recaptures this element.  TLJ doens't even try.  Between the marvel style humour that's constantly reminding you that you're a guy in a threatre watching a screen, not coming up with a single novel environment that you'd have to go into the SW galaxy to see, and ungracefully slapping a different take on a beloved character, this movie ultimately fails to immerse us in it's story and it's characters at some of it's most key moments.﻿",StarWars,True,1514063778,2017-12-23

My thoughts on Snoke,"I’m sure it’s been mentioned somewhere, but My thoughts on snoke is it didn’t matter who he was, he was never important to the story being told. He was a red herring to keep us distracted from who the true villain is (Kylo). Kylo was always going to be the main bad guy. He fucking stabbed his dad in the chest. There hasn’t been any conflict in him in a long ​time. The conflict he showed in TLJ was purposeful. He wanted Snoke to think he was still conflicted when he hesitated to shoot his mom. He knew Snoke was trying to reading his thoughts and wanted him to think he was still struggling. But we saw in the throne room he was in fact playing Snoke the entire time.

[Spoilers] Three changes fix most of what's clunky with TLJ.,"Just saw the movie last night, and on the whole I really loved it.  It handled Luke's arc wonderfully, and I thought that the work the story did with Rey and Kylo was fantastic.  It also tied up a lot of loose ends and set the stage for a much more open 9th film.

That being said, the whole chase arc just felt... a bit clunky.  In breaking down what I did and didn't like, I realized it made sense to focus on what happened with each character's story.

# What went wrong:

Poe's character arc started off strong disobeying orders and attacking the dreadnaught, and the mutiny was at least a step in the right direction, but the fact that his actions directly interfered with Hodo's plans and nearly got the whole resistance wiped out didn't seem to get the attention it deserved.

Leia's story honestly kind of fell flat for me, through no fault of Carrie Fisher's.  I think this is the biggest shame of the movie, considering how much material there was to work with.  I mean, her son just murdered her ex-husband, she spends 80% of the film being chased by the dark lord who turned him, and yet she's mostly used as a Mon Motha-esque figure for the other characters to interact with.

And then there's Finn.  I feel like his arc was the biggest problem with the film, and immediately after watching the movie I felt like Canto Bight was inserted as a ""well we need something for this guy to do"" sequence.

#How do we fix the story?


##### Step 1:  Finn/Rey/Kylo

Instead of having Finn go to Canto Bight, he should have gone to find Rey.  Come up with a way for him to meet up with her just as she's getting ready to go and save Kylo Ren, and let him act as the voice of reason warning her that the obviously evil dude is evil and not to be trusted.  This helps to sharpen Rey's choice a ton.  Rey not listening to Luke kinda makes sense given what we learn about him and Kylo, but Rey not listening to her friend Finn actually holds weight for us.  Introducing Finn takes the already good Rey/Kylo tension and ratchets it up.

Also, how does Rey get onto the Falcon after the light saber explosion/starship ramming?  A quick Finn/Chewie rescue scene provides nice continuity here, replacing the stilted exposition between Kylo and Hux.

##### Step 2:  Hot-Head Poe

Okay so no Finn means no Canto right?  Nope, send hot-headed Poe there.  This serves the same purpose as the mutiny plot, and it also brings the consequences of his actions into much sharper relief.  He can't hide behind Finn's choice to bring the traitorous codebreaker along, it's now completely his fault that so much of the fleet gets blown up instead of tangentially his fault.

##### Step 3:  Snoke and Leia 

Now all we're missing is a reason to cut back to the fleet from time to time, and remind the audience of the chase so that we keep the sense of dramatic tension needed for the other plotlines.

This is where Leia and Snoke come in.  We saw plenty of Snoke's telepathic force powers, why not have him attack unconscious Leia?  We know her husband is dead and her son has turned to evil, but as an audience we never get the satisfaction of really seeing how she feels about it.

Or, if that's too much for the plot, just have holographic Snoke talk to her directly.  It's enough of a plot device to remind us what's at stake for the resistance, and it allows us to learn more about the two most underdeveloped characters of the film, Snoke and Leia.

#Last thoughts

Like I said, on the whole I really loved this film.  It did a great job handling arguably the most important character in all of Star Wars, and for the clunkiness it had in other aspects, I'm very happy with how they've finished Luke's story.

[Spoilers] Saw TLJ for the 2nd time today,"I definitely enjoyed it more the second time. I think the good outweighed any bad plot points. I’m just wondering where they’re going to go in Episode IX with Rey and Kylo. Maybe a time jump 5 to 10 years and have them training new Jedi/Sith for the final battle?

I also felt like the ending, where whatever systems of the Republic are left don’t come to assist the Resistance, reminded me of a Game of Thrones plot. When the Starks were trying to retake the north, they didn’t get much support because the other houses were content with the new regime and didn’t want to start any trouble. Maybe they could do a book or comic book series between episode VIII and episode IX that shows the Resistance trying to unite the Republic against the First Order again.

[SPOILERS] My pitch for Rey in IX,"So in my post VIII excitement I've been writing the beginnings of what I'd do with IX. Here's the trajectory I'd put Rey on. What's missing here is her relationship with Ben, which will also be important but I haven't figured out yet.

Rey

- Struggling with becoming the poster child of the rebels

- Struggling with how to confront Ben. She can’t kill him but he can’t be turned. She asks force ghost Luke for advice

- Supposed to represent the new Jedi but hasn't quite figured it out

- Creates a new double bladed lightsaber from Luke’s crystal

- Coming to grips with the fact that she can’t look to her parents to define who she is .

Struggling to gain allies and support, the Rebels coerce Rey into becoming the Jedi poster child to spread hope throughout the galaxy. She is snuck into meet with sympathetic leaders that are too intimidated to resist. She feels overwhelmed by the responsibility this places on her when she is just beginning to sort through what it means to be a Jedi, and how Luke’s teaching and failings plays into that. 

The Rebels sneaking Rey in to make appearances and show her off is implied or talked about enough to give the sense that they’ve been pulling similar operations a dozen or so times.  We actually see one of these operations play out. Rey, Finn, and Rose (wearing thick robes to hide their identity) sneak into a city to secretly meet with the sympathetic leaders. This will also give some scale to the conflict. Chewie and Poe are circling high in the clouds above in the Falcon and Poe’s X-Wing ready to make a quick get away. 

The leaders meet with Rey with Rose and Finn acting as “honor guard”. Rey has some character moments as she struggles to represent the Jedi while still being uncertain about it all. Through some force connection/mind reading Rey figures out that the leaders are extremely nervous about something, far more nervous than they should be, and it shows in their body language and in the things they say. Rey realizes that they are in the pockets of the First Order and the whole meeting was a trap. 

The Knights of Ren, dispatched by Kylo, burst in and a fight begins with Rey using her new double bladed lightsaber. Squads of Stromtrooopers land nearby to support as nearby pedestrians throw off their disguises to reveal themselves as Rebel soldiers and join the fight.  Using the Falcon as their escape ship, the Rebels barely making it out taking heavy losses. 

This is a hard loss for the Rebels and it further adds to the discouragement they’ve been feeling over the past two years as they’ve struggled to gain support. This as the opening sequence could establish the situation of the Rebellion and the role Rey is now playing and what she’s struggling with.

Ok so doesn't The last Jedi have a massive plot hole? Maybe I'm misunderstanding it? Spoilers ahead obviously.,"**Edit: ok, everything's clear now, thanks everyone! I missed a few lines of dialogue.**

Now I'm more of a casual Star Wars fan so I apologize if I'm misunderstanding obvious something here.

After Rey and Kylo have their force off in Snoke's room and get knocked out, we don't see Rey until she's in the Falcon later. So presumably Chewie picked her up, right? Why didn't Chewie just kill Kylo on the spot while he was knocked out? Wouldn't he want revenge for Han?

Or are we supposed to assume that Rey talked him out of it or something?

Regarding Balance (and the lack thereof),"Balance is a recurring topic of Star Wars.  We see it continually brought up almost every time the concept of a light and dark side of the Force is mentioned.  It has been mentioned in relation to ancient prophecies, the nature of the Force, the role of Jedi and Sith, etc. which has led to a great deal of confusion over what balance in the Force actually means and what the states of balance and unbalance should look like.  In order to better understand balance, I think we need to first understand a few things regarding the Jedi, Sith, and their relation to the light and dark sides of the Force.



**The Force**

Everything in the universe is connected to the Force.  In a sense this makes the universe itself a living entity which is why it is sometimes referred to as the Living Force.  The light and dark sides of the Force are both natural and necessary parts of this Living Force.  The light builds things up, and the dark tears things down.  This generates a cycle of creation, destruction, and re-creation.  To think of it another way, the light side is like breathing in, and the dark side is like breathing out.  You can't have one without the other.  This implies that the light side is not good and the dark side is not evil, they are neutral with regard to morality.  However, when conscious free-will entities are brought into the mix, the ideas of light and dark side both become susceptible to corruption.  The light side creates things we love so we tend to see it as good, but the dark side destroys things we love so we tend to see it as evil.  It is important to remember that both of these ideas are a corruption of the Force.



**The Jedi**

The Jedi understand the nature of the Force and that the light and dark are both necessary.  They desire to maintain this balance by being as neutral as possible.  They attempt to detach themselves from all emotion and desire, sometimes to the point of unhealthy extreme selflessness.  Once a Jedi accomplishes this detachment, they take on the role of peacekeeper ensuring that the less enlightened do not throw the balance out of whack.  To think of it another way, the Jedi desire to maintain still waters; they'll allow small ripples but do everything in their power to cancel out large waves.  Despite understanding that the light and dark sides of the Force are both natural, the Jedi refuse to use the dark side of the Force because destruction is easier than creation, and the temptation to abuse it is too powerful.  They go to great lengths to only use the light side of the Force and stifle emotions that might tempt them to use the dark side.



**The Sith**

The Sith understand the nature of the Force just as the Jedi do.  However, they are not concerned about maintaining the balance between light and dark.  They understand that the Force will take care of itself and that they are free to use it however they please, sometimes to the point of extreme unhealthy selfishness.  The Sith embrace their emotions and use them to fuel their strength in the Force, accomplishing feats that would be otherwise impossible.  To think of it another way, the Sith admire the power of fire and desire to wield it not just for destruction but for creation as well.  The Sith freely use both the light and dark sides of the Force, but because destruction is easier than creation, they often become addicted to the power of the dark side.



**Balance and Unbalance**

Since light and dark are both necessary parts of the Living Force, it is important to maintain balance between them.  If light overpowers dark, then the universe stagnates (we see this beginning to happen during the reign of the Republic).  If dark overpowers light, then the universe dies (we see this beginning to happen during the reign of the Empire).  The legacy of the Jedi embraces the light side at the expense of the dark despite a desire to be neutral, and the legacy of the Sith embraces the dark side at the expense of the light despite being open to both.  In order to restore balance in the Force and put an end to the battle between light and dark, all Force-sensitive beings must learn to acknowledge and harmonize both sides of the Force within themselves and embody the balance they wish to see in the universe.



**tl;dr**

Light and dark are more like creation and destruction or selflessness and selfishness; they do not equate to good and evil.  Unbalance occurs when either side becomes corrupted.  Balance requires accepting both light and dark and using both for good instead of evil.",StarWars,True,1514065679,2017-12-23
I have a theory about Rose," had a thought last night that I can't take out of my head now.

I liked the movie, I liked Rose, but...

What Rose is a spy? An agent of the first order? Or simply a lone agent who just wants to burn it all down to stop the war?

Hear me out: While Rose has expressed hatred of the First Order, the movie makes a point of showing that the ""Star Wars"" in general make life pretty shitty for everyone on the ""ground level"". Specially by showing how those rich people profit of BOTH sides of the war.

She just lost her sister because of Poe's blunder. She might very well be angry at the resistance.

It's through Rose's actions that the First Order gets to destroy most of the resistance. if Rose hadn't suggested the plan to Finn, they wouldn't have gotten captured AND the First Order wouldn't get the information required to destroy the Resistance's transports and reach their base.

Finally, at the end, Finn is about to destroy the First Order's BFG by ramming it with his Speeder. When he's about to do it, Rose rams her's into it and keeps him from destroying it. She saves Finn, sure, but for that moment she would have ACTUALLY doomed everyone there, Finn included, by saving the cannon itself.

This certainly enters ""Darth Binks"" territory, but I propose that Rose is, at the very least, someone who's tired of all this ""Star Wars"" crap and wants to see all the fighting over, even if the way to do it is allowing the First Order to win.

She is not fully ""evil"" per se. I truly believe she actually wanted to save those animals, for example. But her methods to reach the end of the war might be a little too ""chaotic neutral"".",StarWars,True,1514065709,2017-12-23
spoilers - My rant on why I hate the new Star Wars series (and Disney),[removed],StarWars,True,1514065720,2017-12-23
[Spoiler] Star Wars Has A Problem,"One of the major criticisms I hear about *The Last Jedi* is how few of the Resistance survive the film - by the end there aren't even enough to fill the *Millennium Falcon*. 

How, then, is the Resistance supposed to overthrow The First Order in the next and final film of this trilogy?

*The Force Awakens* was Han's film; *The Last Jedi* is Luke's film. 

Ep 9 was always going to be Leia's film.

This is set up in *The Last Jedi* towards the end - 

* Leia makes a point of specifying that her personal code should be transmitted in the call for help. 
* It's reinforced that Leia is the leader of the Resistance when they look at her after Poe tells them to follow him.
* When Rey asks how they can possibly beat the First Order, it is Leia who tells her that they have everything they need.

From this, I believe the original plan was for Ep 9 to focus on Leia rebuilding the Resistance, travelling the galaxy to unit distinct groups of rebels into one movement. Rey would accompany Leia and learn from her in the same way that Rey previously learnt lessons from Han and Luke. This would also build on the themes in *The Last Jedi* that one of the greatest acts a legend can do is to inspire others - the 'nobodies' who make up the bulk of the Resistance and the Rebel Alliance before it. We shift focus from the legends, the 'chosen ones' on to the *people*.

But with the untimely passing of Carrie Fisher, this leaves a big problem for the next film - if the above is true then this wasn't just Leia's film, Leia is virtually essential to the story passing on to Rey the knowledge of politics and respect for various people and groups. Of how to build a future.

**What do you think - does my theory about the original plan for Episode 9 ring true? How could Lucasfilm recover, what replacement plan could they have?**

[Spoiler] Yet another TLJ post: second viewing helped me like the film a lot more,"Not going to make this a long ass post or anything. Mostly general thoughts. When you are so focused on the big picture things with your first viewing, you tend to miss a lot of the details. I learned a lot from listening very closely to what Snoke, Rey, Kylo, and Luke all said and it made me like their choices and characters a lot more. 

Hell, even my opinion of the Leia space flight changed a little once I remembered that clothes won't move and flow in space. Because the effect of the clothes being still was breaking my immersion a bit and when I remembered that detail the effect got better. So I'm neutral on that.

Big thing though is I viewed the movie as a setup. Not just for the next film but probably for the whole franchise. Disney seems to have a lot of grand plans for Star Wars and this set up a lot. As Kylo said, it's the end of the Jedi, Sith, the Rebellion, the Republic, all of it. And something new and hopefully much better will come of it. I even liked Canto Bight more for it's universe building with blurring the lines by making these rich sellers for giving weapons to the First Order and the Resistance.

The only thing that continues to be a giant thorn in the lion paw for me is Holdo not telling Poe her plan to sneak on to Crait. I was trying to find a reason, even a little throw away line but I got no work or reasoning as to why Holdo kept it a secret. As a result, Finn, Poe, and Rose got a lot of people killed and also got the whole Resistance killed. And it's kind of a plot hole to me. So please tell me if I missed something on that. 

Overall I like the movie a lot more and think it's an excellent addition to the Star Wars films. ",StarWars,True,1514067052,2017-12-23
Does the new EU video games feel different?,"Everything from Shadows of the Empire, to Starfighter, to The Clone Wars, etc. all felt like Star Wars. They were fun fantasy elements which were more fantasy than realistic. The whole point was to enjoy the games without having to be dark and gritty. Does anyone feel like the new games are opposite of that? They seem self aware and tie too hard into trying to promote the new movies. Instead of going off and doing their own thing like the old games, they have to feel like an advertisement for a future movie. Do the games feel more dark and gritty and tie in specific to anyone else? Do you think we will ever get another fun and laid back game like Starfighter? ",StarWars,True,1514067229,2017-12-23

How do you feel about [SPOILERS] being common knowledge/canon to the galaxy at large now?,"I thought it was a pretty huge revelation that adds more questions that apparently the common knowledge of Skywalker is that he saved the galaxy and defeated the emperor and turned Vader good.

I had always assumed only Leia and Han knew what happened on the second death star and no one knew the truth about Vader and the emperor except perhaps Kylo because Luke told him about Vader to encourage his pull to the light. And I assumed that Kylo didn't believe it.

Luke just being a myth makes sense if his only real link to the rebellion officially was as an ace pilot that people claimed knew the ways of the force. If everyone knew he confronted Vader, and that Vader was his father and the whole war was jedi vs sith while the regular people suffered I would think he'd be a much bigger deal than some myth.

Hell, I'd think most of the galaxy would be prejudiced against all force users whether they were dark or light. Which would explain why Luke's temple doesn't seem to have been very big and it was just 12 students.

Knowing they Luke is seen as the hero of the rebellion by everyone and that the story of him and Vader is common knowledge according to Rey is kind of a big game changer for what I assumed the lore to be so far from TFA.

So do you think it IS the galaxy wide story of Luke Skywalker and Vader? Or do you think Leia simply told Rey about it off screen before she went to Ach-to? Rey just talks to Luke about it like what we the audience know is what the entire galaxy has known as well for the past 30 years. Wouldn't that make the rise of the first order and Kylo's worship of Vader and the old ways even more perplexing?

I just find the whole ""myth"" about Luke and Jedi/Sith in general as said in The Force Awakens doesn't mesh well with Rey speaking freely about everything Luke did in Return of the Jedi like it's what she grew up hearing from everybody. If it's simply information Leia told Rey in private before she left the resistance base in the falcon or that Rey read Luke's mind to discover the information I'd love some official clarification.

Just watched 'The Last Jedi'. I have a few questions.,"Hi, I just got back from watching 'The Last Jedi'. I really liked most of it, especially the fight scenes, and especially the characters Luke, Rey, and Kylo Ren, but the movie did leave many of my questions unanswered. I am not a dedicated fan of this franchise, so that's why I am coming to this sub to ask:

1. Who is Snoke? Why was his identity never revealed? How does he have strength in the force? How was he able to gain power?

2. What happened to the code breaker man? He just... disappeared after the lady hyperspeeded into the big ship.

3. Speaking of the lady who hyperspeeded, what was the point of her being in the movie? Why was the side conflict between her and the fighter pilot necessary? Why didn't she tell him her plan?

4. What happened to Luke? Did he die at the end? If so, why?

5. What was the point in trying to attack the AT-ATs with those slow, breaking-down speeders? They commented on Finn making a suicide mission but it seemed like a suicide mission from the start to me... and the best pilot was being sent to die, too.

6. What was the point in the code breaker guy showing that the arms dealer sells to both the ""bad guys"" and the ""good guys""?

7. How were Finn and Rose about to be executed, but then the collision occurred, and suddenly all the stormtroopers ready to kill them were gone?

8. What is Kylo Ren's motive in opposing Rey after finally understanding her?

9. If large vessels can be so easily destroyed by a light-speed kamikaze run from any old cruiser, as happened in this movie, what was the point in building star destroyers, death stars, etc. if they can all be destroyed so easily?

10. What was the point of having much of the plot revolve around shutting down an apparent tracker that could apparently track the rebel ships from light speed when the tracker's existence was never even revealed to be certain? Did the tracker even exist?

11. How weren't Finn and Rose shot to pieces when they crashed in the salt right in front of the First Order army? How was Finn able to drag Rose's body all the way back to the base (which was pretty far away, based on how long it took the speeders to reach the walkers), without getting shot, before Luke arrived?

[SPOILERS] Rey and Ren joining would be the best possible ending,"Now, wheter you are imperial or rebel, you got your own ideals and all that, and you fight because you believe in your ideals and that the opposite side is wrong.


Now hear me out. Rey is a rebel of course, and Ren is a imperial but is not a bad guy as say darth vader, who also was once a Jedi. If both ruled the galaxy, we would follow the rules of both, that would mean that no side would have an advantage ruling. That wouldn't necessarely mean an ditactorship but also wouldn't mean that corrupt cities would get away.

"My biggest issue that comes from the new movies isn't even so much in their portrayals, but it is how it devalues the ending of the previous films.","**Note: Any issues fixed with additional media doesn't count to me. Additional canon you have to seek out, outside of the movies are just band-aids to issues. I like to value what is presented in the films when judging their worth and issues, not anything that can be added to provide a retcon. The majority of Star Wars content I like doesn't even come from the films so, I am trying to just focus on this series as a whole.** 

I know the Star Wars community is divided right now and I am sorry if I am contributing to that, but I found myself contemplating the new movies after I saw The Last Jedi. When I walked away from that movie, I felt the same as I did with the Force Awakens. I had a good time, enjoyed some of the scenes, but then upon further reflection developed a bad taste for some of the inconsistencies and issues that it presented. I am not gonna touch upon those too much as thousands of people have already done that. But I do need to establish one problem as it kind of intertwines with my previous problem.

The entire series 1-6, is an (albeit flawed) story of good versus evil, but also a main crux of that story is Anakin Skywalker. His ascension from good hearted boy, troubled youth, path of darkness, his struggles as the chosen one, and his overall redemption by fulfilment of a prophecy thanks to his son never losing faith in him. The films can be taken different ways, but I think that is an accurate summation. Last movie ends with the force, by what we can assume and what a large part of the community agrees, balanced, the empire crumbling, the sith gone, and the rebels freeing the galaxy.

Except apparently that doesn't happen at all.

The Force Awakens establishes The First Order, ruled by a super powerful sith, have essentially replaced the Empire and now the New Republic is in the exact same dire straights.

A couple questions from me. How? Who? What? and Why?

*How did the First Order get to power?* After all the fighting the Rebels are essentially in the exact same position they were before, hell even worse off in TLJ if you think about it.

This is from the wiki page: 

*In the decades that followed the Empire's defeat, the First Order gradually built its strength through the secret mobilization of new fleets and armies in violation of the Galactic Concordance and Republic law. Despite further acts of defiance to the treaty, the Galactic Senate did not regard the First Order as a serious threat to the Republic. However, the Senate's inaction motivated the Rebel veteran Princess Leia Organa to found the Resistance. Although the First Order became entangled in a conflict with Organa's group, the Republic remained its primary target.* **(None of this stuff before these parenthesis is in the movie to my knowledge)** *After thirty years of plotting their revenge against the government that overthrew the Empire, the First Order test-fired the superweapon of Starkiller Base on the Hosnian system and thereby destroyed Hosnian Prime, the capital world of the Republic. Shortly thereafter, the Resistance launched a counterattack that resulted in the base's destruction.*

Which leads to my next question.

**Why does the First Order have so much power?**

Even if you can explain to me why the first order exists, they shouldn't be in the capacity that they are. The Empire made sense. It was the existing republic that was twisted into what it was then by a few key choices made by a powerful figure. Everyone lives oppressed for years, sees the horrors and is like: ""Man, we shouldn't take this anymore"". That's when the Rebels show up and gather their supporters, rightfully so. After beating them, the galaxy rejoices and the Empire surrenders to the New Republic. They say sympathizers and what not come to the surface to establish the First Order and I can believe that (still didn't see it or hear about it on screen), but to the degree where they out match the New Republic? Really? That just seems far fetched to me and again further devalues the struggles of the original trilogy by not giving some kind of dialog about it.

I wouldn't mind this happening, but without saying ""Who would of thought so many Imperials still existed after the war..."" or something, it just seems like a cheap replacement that we are just supposed to accept. 

**Who is Snoke?** The Sith have established they have a rule of 2. Does that mean this super powerful force user was just waiting for the emperor to fall? Force powers are pre-established to some existent (metachlorins and what not) and this dude has shown powers that *far* exceed what we know Vader and Sidious to be capable of? His origin, along with the First Order's, need some establishment in this series and just accepting their existence is weird to me. Maybe I don't remember that scene, but as far as I know they don't really touch on this.

Considering his crappy death, that will no doubt be retconned in the next movie, we aren't even given enough sufficient information to understand why we should fear this guy or how he got in command of *so* many people. The first time we get a display of his awesome power, he is killed off by his apprentice tricking him.

**What happened to the prophecy?**

Whether due to George's risky decision making or not, Anakin was, is, and will always be, the chosen one. One who fulfilled his prophecy and brought balance to the force by killing Sidious (according to Lucas). The fact that the Sith exist in prominence with such strength prove it to be wrong and it negates the value of Vader's struggle with the darkside. Now, if the prequels hadn't of introduced the prophecy that would be different. But they did. So, this is just a destruction of what we know. Which is fine...if addressed. 

I would be fine with the idea that: ""Prophecies are full of shit"" kind of story. Just like I like the idea of ""The Jedi and Sith are wrong, true balance doesn't come from one side being in the right"", but the problem with both of these is as it stands neither of them are possibilities. Both have been *loosely* touched upon, but equally snuffed out. Kylo saying ""they both need to die"" is really cool, only then to say ""join me so we can rule together"" four seconds later.

I am not hear to start a fight, but these holes, even if properly explained in a comic or game or show, doesn't fix the problems in the movie. It just says: ""Well, there *is* a reason, but do you really care? Look at all the cool stuff happening on screen!"" Yeah, cool stuff for sure, but stuff that lacks depth while at the same time clouding the surface of what accomplished in the previous movies. I haven't seen TFA in a while. So, if there are moments that defy this, I would love to get quotes and time stamps as I truly don't remember. 

Edit: A lot of these issues can be fixed in the future with the new movie. But the fact that Star Wars can just get away with that because of it's name is honestly insulting to a lot people who care about knowing all this about the franchise. Fixes will be nice, but that won't change the fact that people watched 2 movies over the course of 2 years
that left them confused and hurt. I like this series, especially all of its non-canon content. Kotor is one of my favorite games of all time, but the damages to the existing lore in this recent series of movies, out way a lot of the good in my opinion.

Edit 2: A couple of things that I have been argued that make no sense to me.

""Vader *did* kill the Sith they are dead for sure. So, the last movies aren't devalued.""

—Okay. If that is true someone tell me the distinct different between the First Order and the Empire. Both are *large* imposing forces, similar tech, both it's leaders use the dark side of the force, there is only two of them, they have an apprentice/master relationship, and are hunting the rebels (which of course means they are hunting the jedi by default). Saying the Sith are dead, and I know the teaching of the Sith in the expanded lore outside of the films is deeper than this, is an argument of semantics. But, let's just say the prophecy meant specifically the Sith. So, killing the Sith will bring balance to the force. So, currently, the force is still balanced by that definition. No one has said in this movie that the prophecy was wrong. No one has commented on it once. I don't see the difference, especially from a movie-goer perspective, and to say that this distinction makes 1-6's still valid is crap. The galaxy is in the exact same spot, if not a worse one, it was 30+ years ago.

""The expanded lore is necessary.""

—I agree with the idea that it is great information to have. It is of course canon but that isn't my point. Unless it is released in the same medium, it is optional information. You can expect a movie-goer to have watched The Force Awakens because The Last Jedi is a sequel. But you can't expect them to keep up with comics or books to understand things that could be explained easily in a movie. That is just a blatant defense of retconing and nothing more. Clone wars is great, and I know it is canon. But a shit ton of people have never seen it. And that doesn't change the portrayal of Anakin in the movies. By all accounts, all you should need to get a satisfied grasp on the Darth Vader origin story should be in the films 1-3. Fixing it in a series people may never exposed to doesn't change the portrayal.

The golden age of television is why so many people are upset about The Last Jedi,"Quite a few (not all, obviously) of the issues people seem to have with the film is that we have the same expectations of a movie that we do of a television series. I think we are all just so used to long-form high quality television series that we expect the same standard of detail. Especially when it comes to franchises that we truly love.

Things like Snoke’s backstory or Ben Solo’s fall to the dark side would been incredibly interesting to know more about. Understanding better why Luke chose to become a hermit would be easier if we had more to work with. How Rey became so mechanically competent. How the First Order had the power to take control of the galaxy in that short timeframe between TFA and TLJ. Most of the issues that people point out as ‘plot holes’ seem to be simply because they director wasn’t able to include every minor detail. But we want these details because this is what we have come to expect from shows like Game of Thrones. 

But a movie has a very limited timeframe to work with so by necessity they can’t include everything we want to know. These details are left to supplementary materials like the novels, which in the past worked fine, but now we have much higher expectations.

What do you guys think? Would people that are unhappy with stuff like Luke’s characterisation been happier if they had been given more detail over more time to better understand his character trajectory? Or people who are angry about Snoke being killed off like a putz - would they have liked it better if they had been shown how his major flaw was his overwhelming arrogance and hubris?

I’ve lost some faith in Disney and the future of Star Wars...,"I liked the movie, it was good. I’m excited to see where it goes from here.

With that disclaimer out of the way... rant incoming...

I’m really disappointed. After TFA I thought they had a plan, I was sure of it. There’s always been a plan, from day one, the Star Wars movies have been made in trilogies with a rough outline, an idea of where they wanted to go. I’d assumed that this was the case for the new trilogy as well....

Obviously not. 

I’m worried, I don’t like it. Rian Johnson made his movie and now it’s canon, and it obviously stepped away from some stuff that was set up in TFA, and now... with Snoke dead... what the fuck. I hope Abrams has a plan, because it’s kinda obvious that Rian didn’t. He just made his movie, and while it’s good, it’s also incredibly disappointing to me. 

Rey’s parents. I heard somewhere that Rian said he chose that angle specifically because it was the least expected outcome.... cmon dude. I clearly remember calling this walking out of the theater for TFA opening night. I basically said “If she isn’t Luke’s kid (which was what I wanted) then she is definitely just an unrelated force user, not connected to anyone else.” 

No that was no surprise.... 

Finn’s plot might as well have been cut as far as I’m concerned... it’s an ok arc, but honestly it just ends up being mostly skip-able, and that’s never something you want in a Star Wars movie. 

Admiral Holdo... fucking stupid. There is no legitimate reason to have her tell Poe to buzz off at the beginning and push foreword the whole mutiny plot only to “vindicate” her later on with the heroic death. She honestly felt forced into the story to me... and idk how I feel about that. 

I feel sexist saying this: but I kinda see it as them almost NEEDING to write an “in charge” woman character for this movie, like they got the actress (forget her name, but I like her) and they basically said, “ok we have so and so, what should we have her do? Because she NEEDS to be in the movie.” 

Honestly the whole thing should have been a traitor plotline. That woulda been so much better, but instead we get 2/3s of our main good guys  (Poe and Finn) fucking around doing ultimately useless stuff the whole movie. That’s fucked up right? I’m not the only one seeing this? 

I just don’t get the impression that this has all been thought out ahead of time, which really sucked because TFA was basically a promise saying: “don’t worry, we thought this out” with that whole force vision etc... except... nope. None of that was true and we have to pray JJ Abrams can finish this off successfully 

Sorry, rant over I just needed to get this stuff off my chest. ",StarWars,True,1514074220,2017-12-23

What makes a Jedi? [SPOILERS],[removed],StarWars,True,1514075740,2017-12-23
This can help avoid another TLJ situation,[removed],StarWars,True,1514075850,2017-12-23
I’ve got a bad feeling..,"That this line wasn’t in The Last Jedi. 
I can’t remember. Does anyone else remember if it’s in there or not?",StarWars,True,1514075933,2017-12-23
Luke's six film arc,"I have been watching the original trilogy with my son, who is five and became fully invested in the saga after watching *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi*. Two lines stuck out to me this time.

&gt; ""Not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock.""

Luke says this while on Tatooine in *A New Hope*. By *The Last Jedi*, he has actually figured out how to teleport himself off of a rock.

&gt; ""A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one, a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away to the future, the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing.""

Yoda says this to Luke in *Empire* (and references the line in *The Last Jedi*). He means this metaphorically, but Luke does learn how to literally take his mind away from where he is by the end of VIII. 

Both observations could be either clever call backs, or just stretches on my part--but I do think there is something more to it. Both lines of dialogue from the original films are meant to show that Luke is always focused on the next big thing, on daydreaming about his future. Yoda believes this to be a fault, or at least, criticizes him for it. 

But I think that by the end of *The Last Jedi*, Luke learns to take the fault that Yoda sees and turn it into this grand expression of his identity.

From the moment he was born, before he could speak, Luke represented the capital-h Hopes of the galaxy. When he expresses concern at the possibility of his friends dying in *Empire*, Yoda and Obi-Wan tell him to stay behind and train, wanting him to sacrifice his only real family because he is their hope for redemption/salvation. 

In *Jedi*, when he refuses to kill his own father, Obi-Wan tells him he has to because he is their only hope. 

He is also, of course, the title character of ""A New Hope."" 

In short, though Luke always looks to the future and the horizon and hopes about his own future, he has always had to act against his personal hopes in order to provide hope for others. 

He was always a symbol, more than he was ever allowed to be a person.

In *The Last Jedi*, Luke runs from that because he recognizes that his failure to be the legend of hope that the galaxy comes to see him as can have far greater ramifications than normal human failure. So he walks away.

And then Rey finds him and she speaks the language of Obi-Wan and Yoda. She wants him to give people hope. She explicitly asks him for this, courtesy of Leia. The crawl identifies him as the ""spark"" that will bring hope back to the galaxy. 

Luke tells Yoda, ""I can't be what she needs me to be."" It would seem he means ""her teacher,"" but what she has asked him to be is ""hope."" 

When Yoda shows him that he can fail and still be what Rey needs him to be--that he can be it better for having failed, he realizes what he has to do.

Luke's final act is--and this is key--both a result of what Yoda helped him see **and** a repudiation of Yoda. In other words, Luke grows beyond Yoda both by doing an amazing and unheard of feat of force power, and by showing that Luke *can* truly accomplish great things by ""still looking to the horizon. Never here, now."" That he can do this as a true Jedi with ""the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.""

Yoda--and everyone in Luke's life--has asked him (and criticized him) to stop looking to his own hopes for the future, so that he can give everyone else hope for their collective futures. It's not unlike George Bailey in *It's A Wonderful Life*, who must continually sacrifice his ambitions for the collective good. 

So Luke projecting himself across the galaxy to Crait shows that Luke *can* provide the galaxy with the hope they need--the hope they unfairly and selfishly demand of him--by doing exactly what he's told not to do: look to the horizon and remove his mind from his here and now. This projection proves what he has always been: an image that represents something for people. A representation, rather than a person. And it is this ***image*** of Luke that is indestructible, that the whole First Order or Empire or whatever can never defeat, even if he appears to have only a ""laser sword"" to defend himself.  Luke realizes that he is an ICON to other people, and he became that icon precisely by being a hopeful person himself, by believing in and hoping for his own future. 

This is now true in the Star Wars galaxy, but it has always been true in our galaxy. Luke has always been an image--a projection of an image from film--that has inspired countless people. He just learned in his own galaxy to become what he has been in ours. He learned who he can be to all of them--and who he always has been to *us*.

The tragedy of Luke's life is that the hope he held for himself could only be fulfilled by the galaxy at large through his life. But unlike his father and unlike his masters, he left the physical realm with countless connections to the lives of others. He became the ""horizon"" that he looked to as a youth and at his death--for the downtrodden in the galaxy. This is why he died with ""peace and purpose"" rather than despair and fear. He went beyond his masters, and by growing beyond his own personal failures and choosing to come back to embrace his identity as The Hope of the galaxy, he gave his own pupil what she needs to grow beyond him and do what he could not: revive the Jedi and recreate them as something new, something beyond what they once were.

You can tell me that The Last Jedi doesn't work for you as a film, as a piece of entertainment, etc. But as a conclusion of the arc that began for Luke Skywalker 40 years ago, that moves from his infant appearance in *Sith* to his death in *Last Jedi*, I think it's as good as it gets. It's sad and it's tragic in many ways, but far more than that, it's inspiring and hopeful. That's Luke Skywalker.",StarWars,True,1514076032,2017-12-23

Would some multiverse plot connect current canon with EU?,"Think of it like Star Trek's multiverse or even The Terminator with different timelines. If Disney created a way to show the Legends timeline exists, but in a different universe instead of just pretending like it didn't happen at all like they are doing now, do you think it will do great in appealing both fanbases? I know we will never please everyone, but I miss the old timeline with the fun Clone Wars battles and the different vehicles and clone troopers they used. I miss the stories of games like Starfighter and Knights of the Old Republic which are now considered non canon. It feels like a slap in the face to everyone who enjoyed them all and a ploy by Disney just to make money, enjoyment of the fans be damned.

"Slight detail, not sure if it's important or not, but I think it is (Spoilers from TLJ!)"," In the scene where Rey is practicing her lightsaber skills by attacking the rock, she starts by using the typical ""Jedi"" method of swinging the lightsaber, with calm, precise movements. Soon after, she gets a sly smile on her face and starts wielding the saber back-handed, a-la Asaj Ventress from the clone wars TV series. From background knowledge, I'm aware that a force-users fighting style with a lightsaber is indicative of how much they let their emotions control their movements, so I would assume the more aggressive, backhanded style Rey uses here is another hint that she's not scared to let her emotions flow through her. Just a small detail that I think adds to the ""no good, no evil, but grey"" theme that we saw throughout TLJ!",StarWars,True,1514076662,2017-12-23

Improving an important piece of exposition in TLJ,"Along with many of you that have seen TLJ, I really appreciated the different sides of the Luke/Ben flashbacks. We've never really seen anything like this in the franchise before; different sides to an event that can mislead the viewer through biases.

Onto my critique, I found the actual length of the flashback lacking. I did begin to understand Luke's motivations for the reasons why he was pondering to kill Ben after looking at many Reddit explanations, but for the average joe watching the film, there's just not enough there. In other words, the actual substance of what was there was great, there just wasn't enough of it.

A 15 min plus flashback involving the actual destruction of the new jedi order would have vastly improved the storytelling. Imagine actually seeing Ben (and possibly the knights of ren) rebelling and destroying the temple. We could have seen them kill their fellow jedi. Luke would confront Ben and possibly fight him but would run off after realizing the amount of power Ben possesses.

We did get that great shot of Luke watching the burning temple: https://imgur.com/a/PXKfj
I just don't think it was enough. It seems that the rest was missing; it was possibly filmed and we were only shown that last shot? 

Had we seen the actual rebellion by Ben, we would have understood so many things. A possible reasoning by Ben into what made him turn to the dark side, an emotional view into the motivations for why Luke had to leave in exile (a criticism so many on here have made). Just imagine how beautiful that scene would look at nighttime as we see Luke confront Ben and then leave in his X-Wing.

I think Johnson missed a big piece of exposition here. A flashback that could have brilliantly set up and answered so many things. I am not bashing TLJ, but I'm a bit upset we got an overly long Canto Bight subplot when this exposition piece would have added so much more to the story. Plus, we would have seen Luke and Kylo go at it!

TL;DR: a 15 minute plus flashback showing the fall of Luke's new jedi order would have given important motivations for why characters do certain things.

What is Jedi Training really about? Is it actually necessary to control the Force?,"So far I've been operating under the belief that Rey's affinity for the Force makes perfect sense.

I know we've seen her go from ""nothing"" to ""moving giant rocks"" in the span of ~5 days. But that's because like she has literally said herself, ""It was always there and needed to be awoken.""

I don't think that's just a copout, I think it's the point of her story. In fact, I think it's the point of *this whole trilogy*.

Luke needed training because he couldn't open himself up to the Force. He was jaded, he had so much emotional baggage. He couldn't *feel* the force, and he couldn't let it flow through him. He couldn't let the Force in. ""I can't do this, it's ***impossible***."" Get it? Luke's problem was he never even believed it possible. Rey never had that problem. She was ready to believe from the beginning. Combine that with her being a 'force sensitive', and you get... well, Rey.

She didn't need ""jedi"" training because the Jedi are just an Order. The Jedi don't own or control the Force any more than Catholicism ""owns"" Jesus. They're just an order with their own ideas and rules about how to use the Force.

But Luke's whole point, and Rey's abilities come from the fact that The Force is a part of the universe, a part of nature, and for some people, an innate part of *themselves*. Rey was free from all baggage and came with the ability to *feel* the Force.

And as far as I can tell, *feeling* it is only a hop, skip, and jump away from *controlling* it. 

I have been believing that Rey's abilities are practically part and parcel with Luke's beliefs that ""the jedi must end"". Because the universe holds them accountable for the Force sort of, and Rey is literally living proof that affinity for the Force has nothing to do with a hinky old religious sect. 

All of that being said... I'm not ""up"" on the books, etc. And there was that jedi training temple for kids early on. But I always felt that the temple existed not just to teach kids how to use the force, their admission into the academy was sort of incumbent upon their ability in the first place. I always figured the jedi temple was mostly about emotional training, so they don't turn to the dark side. So.. what did I miss?",StarWars,True,1514077843,2017-12-23

Idea for Spin-off Movie,"I was thinking about an anthology movie that follows a small group of storm troopers like in trenches and swapping stories etc.  The entire movie is seen through the eyes of these storm troopers.  The main story is that there’s an unnamed Jedi that survives Order 66 (not Obi wan) and basically through the eyes of these storm troopers this Jedi is the most horrifying thing possible.  Sort of like how Batman is so terrifying to thugs even though he’s the good guy.  This Jedi is almost like a spectre or a phantom to these troopers that constantly shows up and wrecks their plans and kills their fellow soldiers.  Then the movie ends when Vader finally comes down from his star destroyer and lures this Jedi into a trap.  This would be a few years after Ep 3 but well before ANH.

It would humanize the storm troopers in an interesting way and most importantly give plenty of opportunity to see cool lightsaber action and an opportunity to see a Jedi in their prime from a unique perspective.  Also an opportunity for a good duel between a prime Jedi and prime Vader that shows Vader as being sort of the protagonist.",StarWars,True,1514079744,2017-12-23

Snoke and Darth Maul Comparison [The Last Jedi Spoilers],"[Spoilers below for The Last Jedi below, and for that matter, Phantom Menace and Empire Strikes Back]

.



.

Darth Maul was an extremely skilled Sith Lord who had the upper hand, but was defeated by Kenobi in a way that made everyone say ""What the... ... ...fuck?""

Supreme Leader Snoke was made out to be this ultra-powerful dark side force user who can feel your every intention. And then, ""whoops, I was too busy being so powerful and masterfully manipulative that I didn't realize you were about to cut me in half.""

Speculation: will Kylo replace his [SPOILER]?,"“You’re just a child, in a mask” 

After being ridiculed by Snoke, Kylo destroys one of his favorite toys. It’s a  gift given to him by JJ Abrams himself- his helmet.  

We saw Kylo distance himself from his Vader worship in TLJ. Though not explicitly stated, it seems to me that his obsession would be a part of the past he’s speaking about when he says to Rey,  “Let the past die. Kill it, if you must.”

However, one could argue that in killing Snoke, Kylo was actually fulfilling his journey to Vader-dom, as Vader too killed his master, the Emperor.

So what do you guys think? I know that helmet has played a huge part in the marketing for these films, and they probably sell tons of helmet merch, but they did let Rian destroy it.

Will Kylo reconstruct his helmet? Will he forge a new one? Or is naked Kylo Ren his final form?

Any info on George's original versions?,"So, there have been conflicting stories and claims in regards to how much of George's drafts made it into the final versions of Episodes VII-IX. 

George himself said they ditched his drafts and J.J. said he wasn't given access to them. Mark Hamill also claims that George's ideas for Luke were rather different.

On the other hand, Kathleen Kennedy has said they were working from his drafts, and that any changes were typical to a major production. Michael Arndt (former VII writer) I believe said he was given George's draft and was told to work from there. Pablo Hidalgo has also said something similar to what Kathleen said.

However, from everything I've found, it seems a number of elements that wound up in The Force Awakens and (somewhat) The Last Jedi were sourced from George himself. Things like the lead being a young female from the Galactic equivalent to nowhere, the villain being a Sith fanboy, stormtroopers and Imperial stuff coming back, and, most importantly, Luke being a bitter recluse on some island.

Here are some links I've found regarding info on his versions:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_sequel_trilogy#Story_development

http://www.slashfilm.com/george-lucas-sequel-trilogy/

http://www.indiewire.com/2015/05/george-lucas-original-star-wars-sequel-treatments-focused-on-teenaged-characters-264251/

So here's my thinking on the logic behind the conflicting claims:
George hands his drafts to Disney and Kathleen Kennedy. She hands them to Michael Arndt and tells him to write an Episode VII draft from them. Arndt writes but feels he's not up to the task, and then J.J. Abrams is hired to direct and finish writing. J.J. is given Arndt's Lucas-sourced draft, but not Lucas' original drafts themselves, essentially cutting the production team off from those original versions, giving George the impression they're not using his ideas. Certain ideas that don't make it into the final product (expansion of Luke's story) are inherited by Rian Johnson, who writes an all new original story with left-over Lucas version Luke Skywalker as the center of the film. And Episode IX will be the first wholly original saga film from Disney.

In terms of Mark Hamill's claims, Luke seemed to be deeply connected to the Force in meditation in Lucas' drafts. According to George, something ""ethereal"" would have happened to Luke. So it seems Luke hiding himself and being cynical isn't what was different, it was his connection to the Force that changed, or lack thereof in the final product.

My question to you guys is do you guys know of any more info from his versions? Something that may have been overlooked? It seems in my eyes what we got was not overly dissimilar from what he had in mind in terms of the characters.

"TLJ and believing in hope when we can't see it, along with some subtle predictions for Ep. IX","Hello! I was just mulling over TLJ after I'd seen it a second time, and wanted to share what I got out from it as not really a film critic, per se, but as a SW fan who found a sort of catharsis in the middle of my second viewing. (So sorry if these comments have already been made)

**So here it goes:** 

Personally, Leia's lesson about how *""If you only believe in hope when you can see it, you'll never make it through the night""* (paraphrased) encapsulated the theme of TLJ for me, or at least that seemed to be the message and **experience of disillusionment, cynicism, and hopelessness in which Rian wanted to embroil us**. And I think the character of DJ really exemplifies it and hits it home.

DJ has had divided reception, to say the least, and that division is probably skewed to the unfavorable side, with brows furrowed as to why he was written, or why he had to be sitting his butt on Canto Bight. But I also think that part of the reason his character rings so empty to us is because, in TLJ, we've only been given *a very slim peek* at his character arc to come. (Whether this allocation was wise is a discussion for another post). 

DJ unleashes a cutting bite of cynicism on Finn: *""It's all machine, brother""* (or something like that, sorry, also paraphrased). In essence, the good and the bad, the rebels and the Empire/First Order, slaughter each other using the same deadly contraptions dealt to them by the same chronic gamblers wallowing in champagne. And as audiences and SW fans our conviction and our love of the light is also shaken by his cynicism; *we share Finn's momentary disillusion, the comprising of his hope.* 


**The other critical (and most controversial) scenes of the TLJ hammer down this message on us.** Luke, however briefly, attempted to murder Ben/Kylo. Rey leaps into the dark cave and is willing to sacrifice herself and abandon Luke--along with it all the hopes of being trained by a Jedi master--to try to turn Kylo against all odds. Snoke, quite literally, falls flat. He's a nobody. Rey's a nobody. Hux is Kylo's plaything. It's all very new, and weird, and in some ways, disturbing. 

And I think this is why one of the reasons people state for loving or appreciating, at least, TLJ is that it is very **intimate.** And I think that's true. Whether *all* of the bitter disappointment and challenge of faith was intended by Rian or not, the same internal turmoil comes crashing down on us that Poe feels when he witnesses his X-Wing and squadron burn to pieces; when we feel like we have been stripped of that hope, goodness, and clarity (even now I can't put my finger on it, that spark?)--that makes SW SW.

So going back to DJ, Rian **scatters and shakes all of the archetypes and themes that we have learned to love and draw inspiration from over the years from the SW universe.** But we're not supposed to exhaust ourselves and despair. I remember (this is also very paraphrased), when Finn is pressed to the floor of the The Supremacy, about to be executed, and DJ spits his last charming bit of cynicism at him about the war, Finn tells him: **""You're wrong.""** 

And this is what TLJ, at the end of all of the discussions and debate and division, asks us to do: stare at the cynicism and say, **""You're wrong.""**
Wars won't be endless, because the rebels and the light and balance hope will win--even if that doesn't look like the rebels *blowing all of the First Order's gear up*--friendship and love and compassion can still win. You can be a hero without being impeccable, because heroes fail, we all fail, sometimes our expectations are failed, but at the end of a day, we can look to the beginning of the next, and hope that Ep. IX will bring back to us that SW we loved. 

And I would go to say (or hope) that this is why JJ is set to return to helm in Ep. IX. TFA welcomed us back into the SW world we were familiar with and loved. TLJ is a challenge: we face disillusionment, cynicism, and hopelessness along with Rey, Luke, Poe, Finn, and even Leia. But then there is Ep. IV. And we still have hope. So do our ragtag group of protagonists. It's more drawn out than we're used to, but I think these character arcs--along with DJ's--lead to somewhere hopeful and brighter. At least, I hope this is the case.

Thanks for getting through such a long post!

**TL; DR** TLJ, and the motifs of disillusionment, hopelessness, and cynicism is meant to shake us, but it also gives us a more resolute version of hope that will carry us through Ep. IX--where many of the more divisive, incomplete character arcs (~~hopefully~~) will find a cathartic and stirring resolution.

[Spoilers] An analysis of the Holdo Maneuver,"I think everyone pretty much agrees that Vice Admiral Holdo's lightspeed kamikaze was a stand out moment in the film. A lot of people are wondering about the implications though, and I think it's interesting to think about. So, here's my analysis. (Warning: Speculation heavy)

###An Open Question

I think the first thing we need to consider when thinking about this moment is that it didn't actually introduce anything new to Star Wars. All it did was answer an open question. It's a question many of us never asked, including myself, but that doesn't mean it wasn't there.

This was something that was always possible within the framework of Star Wars. Prior to this film, we just didn't know how it would work out. But I think if you now ask yourself, without considering The Last Jedi at all, ""What happens when a ship hits another ship at lightspeed?"" you have to come to a conclusion relatively close to what we saw.

First of all, we know going into hyperspace is dangerous. Han tells us that without precise calculations, you'll fly into a planet or a star and that will end your trip real quick. Now, Han doesn't mention hitting other ships, but that makes sense. Ships are much smaller, more mobile, and less numerous than astronomical bodies. The chances of hitting one by accident are probably comparably small.

So we know hitting something at lightspeed is really bad news for you, but we don't know how the thing you hit fares. We start with a binary, either it's damaged or it isn't. While I think the most satisfying and intuitive answer is that it is damaged, it's also possible that it isn't. Perhaps the energy disperses into hyperspace and the target is fine, or something.

In fact, that could still be true, because we don't know if Holdo made it to hyperspace. One of the other things we know is that ships accelerate to lightspeed to punch into hyperspace, and the first and last bits of that process take place in real space. We see ships punch in and out of hyperspace, and they don't stop on a dime. That lead in and tail to hyperspace jumps is probably kilometers at minimum.

In fact, we don't know if Han even meant to imply that you could hit things while in hyperspace. Maybe he only meant during this time of rapid acceleration or deceleration in real space. Calculate wrong, and you come out of hyperspace like you were shot out of a cannon into a planet's surface.

So in my opinion, even without The Last Jedi telling us, it makes the most sense to conclude that hitting something at lightspeed is bad news.

So how bad is it? Well, it seems like it should be pretty devastating, shouldn't it? If Star Wars obeyed real world physics, it'd probably be way worse than what we see in TLJ, I think. I think the portrayal in TLJ actually rode the line pretty well between making it scary and powerful and avoiding putting a super weapon on every ship.

So if we look at what happened in TLJ and accept that it makes sense, other questions arise. The biggest one being ""Why doesn't this happen all the time?"" So now I'm going to look at those. (Warning: Speculation intensifies.)

###A Tactical Analysis

So, the benefits of ramming ships at lightspeed are pretty obvious. Why aren't we building lightspeed missiles?

Well, first of all let's look at the actual effect of Holdo's attack. The light show was pretty damn spectacular, but what actually happened?

At the cost of her life and The Raddus, the Resistance's likely irreplaceable flagship, Holdo crippled the Supremacy and destroyed 4-6 of the First Order's 12 support destroyers.

Ignoring the economic implications of this particular attack (I'll get to that later), that's a pretty solid trade. The Raddus is a bigger ship than those star destroyers, but much smaller than The Supremacy.

Still, the Supremacy wasn't fully destroyed. Most of the people on board actually seemed to be just fine. With a major breach like that, it would likely make a pretty appealing target, though. It seems likely its shields would have been down and it would be incapable of maneuvering, much less jumping to hyperspace.

However, it would probably still have teeth. Clearly its entire compliment of starfighters wasn't necessarily lost, because Kylo's shuttle is fine, and the surface of that ship is still covered in likely operational guns. The systems inside the ship seem to be functioning after the attack, at least.

Those Resurgents really didn't fare well though. Even if the Supremacy can be recovered and repaired, those star destroyers are scrap and the crews likely took heavy if not complete casualties.

The conditions for the Raddus' attack were pretty much ideal, however.

First of all, while fleets in Star Wars don't seem to take advantage of the expanse of space (I'm looking at you, Resistance bombers), I think the First Order fleet was uncommonly close together. They were in a chase, and basically all in a line.

While the Supremacy is a huge ship, it's still a small shadow for 12 Resurgents to inhabit. All of them were right in that shadow. Still, even though all of them were danger close to The Supremacy, only a handful of them took the hit.

The Holdo Maneuver basically looked like a lightsaber strike. Vast amounts of power, focused into a relatively small area. The flare afterwards didn't seem to deal any noticeable secondary damage. In a normal fleet engagement, you'd probably be hard pressed to hit more than two ships.

Then we have an issue of range. The Raddus was out of engagement range with the First Order fleet, which implies most fleet action takes place at much closer range. Presumably these ships don't remain at maximum weapons range during typical combat.

This may have put The Raddus in the sweet spot. Any closer, and it wouldn't have nearly as much acceleration to deal as much damage. Any further, and it might just make the jump, and who knows if the collision still happens in that case. Also, perhaps the level of damage we witnessed was contingent upon hitting the enemy vessel just as the ship began to breach into hyperspace?

Further, The Raddus is a beast of a ship. It's huge. It's slightly longer than a Resurgent class Star Destroyer, which is twice as big as an Imperial Star Destroyer. It's size likely plays a role in the damage dealt.

So while the damage was significant, perhaps if you scaled down the attack to something like a hyperspace missile, maybe the effect wouldn't be nearly as impressive. Perhaps it would have devastating penetrating power, but a small damage cross section. Essentially, a hyperspace missile might just punch an inconvenient but manageable hole through a ship.

Alright, so maybe it's not often a suitably viable strategy. But still, it has its uses, obviously. Holdo demonstrated that it can be effective. So why doesn't this happen all the time?

Well, we don't actually know that it doesn't. We've never seen it before, but that doesn't mean a whole lot. The Star Wars galaxy is a big place, with a long history, and we've only seen a little of it. I'd actually say that The Last Jedi implies that this does happen with *some* regularity.

First of all, Holdo thinks to do it at all. Maybe she's just being really innovative and trying something totally new, but more likely, she knew it would work. At the very least, she thought it likely enough to work that it was worth sacrificing her life and The Raddus attempting it over any other plan.

Secondly, Poe immediately knows what she is doing, and Hux and the Captain of the Supremacy figure it out pretty quickly. I think it's pretty likely that they all probably know that such an attack is theoretically possible.

So if such an attack is possible and Holdo wasn't the first to think of it, why didn't they use this technique against the Death Star?

Well, I'm still skeptical that such an attack would be effective. First of all the Rebel Alliance's largest ship, Home One, was half the size of The Raddus. Secondly, Death Stars are pretty tough.

We see The Executor, a ship more than an order of magnitude larger than Home One, crash into the Death Star II with little effect. Granted, it does so very slowly, but it still shows the Death Stars are tough.

Also, the Death Star I is 160 km in diameter. It's huge. A ramming attack, even at lightspeed, may not penetrate to the core.

Finally, maybe it was just too expensive...

###An Economic Analysis

Wait, too expensive?! To take out a Death Star?! Well... Yeah.

The Rebellion had less than half a dozen MC80s like Home One at their peak, and they didn't have a nation backing them. At the time of the Battle of Yavin I'd be surprised if they had more than one or two MC80s, and they couldn't just order up replacements. The destruction of the Death Star is what bought them the support to expand their fleet.

I genuinely think that since Yavin is an uncivilized planet and the base is already compromised, the Rebellion would rather evacuate the base and let the planet be destroyed than sacrifice one of these priceless assets on an uncertain plan. Fortunately, they had a better, less costly plan.

So why not build a hyperspace bullet out of a huge chunk of metal or an asteroid with nothing but a hyperdrive on it and slam it into the Death Star? Well, the first time they didn't have time.

As for the second time, I think a plausible excuse might be that it just wouldn't be within their economic power. I think it's very likely that the core cost of a vessel is its hyperdrive.

I doubt that the hyperdrive on a snubfighter can move a capital ship into hyperspace. I'm betting that the bigger the thing you want to move, the more powerful and complex the hyperdrive needs to be. I think that means it's likely that in comparison to the materials cost of the rest of the ship, the designing and building of a hyperdrive is probably by far the most expensive part.

This would mean that it wouldn't be significantly less expensive or feasible to design a hyperspace bullet than it would just to build a ship around the same hyperdrive.

Perhaps the cost of a hyperdrive scales exponentially with how much mass it needs to move. Moving small freighters is easy enough that normal citizens can afford to own them, but moving a capital ship might be significantly more difficult and expensive.

If you make your hyperspace bullet small enough to be economically viable, it's not effective enough to justify the cost. If you make it big enough to be tactically viable, it's too expensive and difficult an engineering project to be economically viable for a militia.

But surely that doesn't apply to the Empire. They love extravagantly expensive weapons of mass destruction, why don't they have this in their arsenal?

Well, here again we don't actually know for sure they don't. Maybe we just never see them use it. But I think it's more likely they just have better options. It's probably a lot cheaper and more effective to just unload on a target with a Star Destroyer's formidable weapons platform.

Hell, if they could keep the damn things around long enough to see a return on their investment, it's probably more economical to fire the Death Star than it would be to build a single use hyperspace bullet.

###Too long! Didn't read.

So in summary, I think it's plausible to say that the Holdo Maneuver is only effective enough to be tactically and economically viable in a moment of extreme desperation, and even then only in a moment of perfect opportunity.

I recognize this is all speculation, and that the real answer boils down to ""because it's a space fantasy franchise and no one has decided to include this before."" If you hate this, I'm not really out to convince you. This is just what I like about Star Wars. I like thinking about this stuff and trying to understand the world as best I can, and I like sharing those thoughts.

I find it more fun to rationalize the world I'm presented with than to deconstruct it. I prefer to ask ""Why does this work?"" rather than contemplate why it doesn't or shouldn't. I'm in no way saying criticism isn't valid, just that I prefer to patch a plot hole rather than fall in, if I can.",StarWars,True,1514083376,2017-12-23

Snoke's plan in TLJ (spoilers),"Here comes my theory about what really happened in the throne room.

In the beginning of the movie, it was established that Snoke could move people in the air even if he was far away when he punished Hux. Why not something more subtle like a choke to demonstrate Snoke's evilness for folks who haven't seen TFA yet?

In the end of the movie we learned that it was possible to project illusions that could even fool experienced force users. Why did they invent this power? Why couldn't Luke simply join the crew of the Falcon and leave the island this way?

As you see, both of these powers were kind of unnecessary for the movie if they weren't meant to hint at something else. We only have to make one little assumption and Snoke's death suddenly makes sense: Snoke could project his image just as Luke could.

So what was likely his plan? First, what was his problem? Snoke's problem was that there were two unpredictable, naturally powerful force users who had motivations to kill him. That was at least one too many for a dark side emperor. He wasn't even sure which one was stronger after the fight on Starkiller base. The first step to a solution was the mind link between Kylo and Rey. In order to tear them apart later, he first had to get them closer together. He manipulated them into trying to convert the other one simply by allowing them to communicate. Note that this communication link worked across large distances, just as Snoke's remote force pushes and Luke's projection.

Snoke knew that Kylo would bring Rey to him because Kylo wanted to prove himself to his master after the humiliations earlier in the movie. He ordered Kylo to kill Rey. We are left to assume that this was his final test. Which makes zero sense if you think about it. Snoke already knew that Kylo had no problem killing rebels, he even murdered his own father. Rey and Kylo hated each other. This wasn't the test.

Kylo passed his actual test perfectly: Embracing the dark side by killing his own master out of hate and hunger for power. Kylo didn't really kill Snoke because the man on the throne was just a projection, but Kylo didn't know that. He only learned that this power even existed later in the movie. Do you remember how Kylo was to complete his training soon in the end of TFA? TLJ *was* his final training session. He proved that he could defeat his enemy Rey, defeat his master Snoke and lead the First Order if necessary. He was ready to complete his training which was symbolized by him taking off the mask.

The actual reason for faking his own death was something else though. He was afraid of Kylo and Rey. He knew that they could team up against him which was confirmed in the throne room. Snoke was their common enemy. He took that common enemy away so that one would kill the other eventually. The remaining one would either become his apprentice or could be dealt with otherwise. The light saber wasn't lying next to Snoke out of negligence. Would Snoke really be that stupid? He almost begged Kylo to be killed. Snoke said ""strike me down"" with no words.

I realize that this is probably too complicated to be actually true, but I think the events make sense this way.",StarWars,True,1514084570,2017-12-23

Another Snoke hot take,"Here's an angle I haven't seen brought up much in discussions about TLJ: Snoke was a masterful manipulator, but wasn't actually that powerful. Sure, he can do some fancy force grabbing, and toss around force rookies no problem, and the way he can get in people's heads is pretty impressive, but maybe it was all a big con. We know he's been around for a long time, but where was he when the emperor was in power? He was hiding. Hiding because he knew that if he ever ended up on the Sith radar he would be hunted down and destroyed by Vader and Palpatine. If he's so powerful and wanted Luke dead, why didn't he just go find him and go toe to toe? Because he couldn't. I think Snoke is basically a very gifted mind reader, and a con man who uses his force ability to fake his way to the leadership of the first order. After all his manipulations he finally overstepped his ability, and was quickly swept aside by Kylo, an untrained but actually powerful force user. Discuss.",StarWars,True,1514086209,2017-12-23
Kylo’s hand (last Jedi spoilers),"Something I noticed in the new film is how Kylo is reaching out to Rey. When her and Kylo had their moment on Ahch-To, Kylo slipped off his glove before meeting her hand. However, after their fight together after Snoke’s death, Kylo reaches for her hand again. This time is different. Kylo doesn’t remove his glove. He lets he darkness cover his only link to Rey and the light. ",StarWars,True,1514086280,2017-12-23

About Kylo-Ren's helmet...,"Clearly Kylo Ren is seen destroying his helmet in the beginning of Episode 8. Do you think he will recreate the same helmet for episode 9? He doesn't care about Snoke saying it was a ""ridiculous mask"" because he clearly didn't care for Snoke as he killed him. Or do you think him destroying the helmet was a symbol of his character evolving and moving past trying to emulate Darth Vader? I personally love the mask myself. What do you guys think?

My stupid Snoke theory.,"What if Snoke IS Darth Plagueis, the one who knows how to cheat death and create life using the Dark Side of the force? My completely made up theory is he was the one that willed Anakin in to existence via his mom's so-called 'immaculate conception' inspired by a force premonition of the future, to ultimately be a tool to destroy the emperor, his former apprentice, and allow Snoke to regain power and control. Further, he will return in Ep. 9, self-resurrected using his dark power, forcing Rey and Ben to work together (who discover they're actually twins) to find how to truly destroy this unkillable Sith Lord, and tying all the movies together. The irony being that the offspring of Snokes own force creation ultimately destroys him using a balance of the light side and dark, showing that the force always balances itself out in the end. 

Also explains why Kylo and Rey's force connection is still going after Snoke dies. Because he didn't die.",StarWars,True,1514087060,2017-12-23

"[Spoiler]TLJ was a different type of Star ""War"" movie","I know there are passionate fans and detractors of this film, but I genuinely thought the Resistance plotline in TLJ was interesting because it was the first time I've seen a space siege take place in a Star Wars film. Maybe we can count the ground assault on Hoth as sort of siege in Empire, but it was a very interesting dynamic to see one in space. A siege is a very different type of battle than the skirmishes in space we're used to seeing, but it's a common tactic in wars.

&amp;nbsp;

There's the aggressor who has all the resources they need to take the defensible position, but knows that patiently waiting in that position of power is more advisable than muscling through the defenses in what would be a costly, albeit ultimately victorious assault.

&amp;nbsp;

Then there's the defending army, who may not have the same resources as the aggressors, but are able to fend off attacks for a period of time. As their resources burn up and the sieging army gets closer to their goal, the defenders have to formulate a variety of unorthodox plans, first to win the battle, then merely to survive to fight another day. There's an ever-increasing level of distrust and desperation among the defenders, as they find themselves in an increasingly precarious position, their time hopelessly running out.

&amp;nbsp;

This kind of thing happens in war movies all the time, we just haven't had a chance to see one play out in Star Wars. I was absolutely thrilled to see this movie take the ""Star Wars"" in a unique direction. With Rogue One we got a covert ops mission to steal the Death Star plans. And Rian Johnson has given us a siege…in space!",StarWars,True,1514088299,2017-12-23
Could they redo the prequels?,"Before anyone jumps down my throat; I LOVE THE PREQUELS. I’m only asking metaphorically. 

Couldn’t they take the raw footage, and use today’s superior technology to remaster them? 

That would mean we have the same movies, same actors, same everything, but better CGI, which would take the movies to the next level. ",StarWars,True,1514088464,2017-12-23
The reason I like the prequels,"I agree that most of the dialogue is atrocious and the plot is whatever, I still have to applaud George Lucas for creating them.

The prequels absolutely look how I think the Star Wars Universe should look. Cities are very futuristic and elaborate, the ships and vehicles are all hi-tech and look amazing. They also have many different planets that the plot takes part on

But the biggest reason of all that I enjoy them is they have the most usage of the lightsabers. When I think of Star Wars I want to see the Jedi running around with lightsabers fighting useless droids and clones, and having wonderful choreographed fight sequences.

Most action movies have a problem with unnecessary fights that kind of take away from the plot and feel like the producers just added them to make the movie longer. But I feel that the sequels and the new episodes lack screen time with lightsabers and they are only used in the fights between main characters.

I love all the Star Wars movies for what they are but people should also consider all the good things the prequels have done.",StarWars,True,1514088470,2017-12-23
Rey's Parents,"I searched to see if this question was asked and didn't see any discussion so I apologize in advance if it's been talked about recently.

Kylo Ren stresses to Rey that she has to leave the past behind in order to become who she is meant to be. We understand this now to be who Kylo wants her to become. When he then talks to her about her parents and tells her that they were wasters trading her in for drinking money, did anyone else immediately feel that he was lying to her? 

I'm torn on it myself. I like the idea that the force created her to be the light to counteract Kylo's darkness the way the force created Anakin to be the dark to counteract the Jedi's light.  I just think it also makes sense for her parents revelation to be something more than a red herring.  ",StarWars,True,1514088573,2017-12-23

But the scene where Luke is fighting Kylo at the end is so that the rest of the resistance can escape from the first order is a total comparison to the scene where Obi Wan is fighting Darth Vader on the Death Star, distracting him and the stormtroopers so that Luke/Leia/Han could all escape.

The Darkside of the Fanbase,,StarWars,True,1514088923,2017-12-23
(SPOILERS) The implication of a certain lightning strike and something I hope the writers explore in Episode 9,"I loved the Yoda scene in TLJ, like many people. It was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  Obviously it was a great heartwarming scene and provided some great yoda quotes, but it also showed a little bit more than that. Something I found extremely interesting about it that has only been talked about a bit is the way Yoda conjured a powerful lightning strike as a force ghost.

In the previous films, there might have been SOME indication that force ghosts can interact with the environment in minor ways. For example, Obi Wan was sitting next to Luke on a branch in episode 5(or 6, I forget which.) But for the most part, I think we’ve mostly been led to believe that force ghosts are basically there to offer wisdom and inspiration, and that they can’t so much interact with the environment. 

However there were 2 moments that threw that on its head. Yoda conjuring the lightning, and Yoda bomping Luke with his cane. Sure, the cane thing was probably just for humorous effect and a nice call-back to the original trilogy, but I think it also served to emphasize the point that the lightning showed, force ghosts can interact in some capacity. 

But the lightning, the implications of that are huge. Yes, that was probably the most sensible route to go with that tree burning, but there were a ton of paths they could’ve took. They could’ve let Yoda stand by and let Luke burn the tree. They could’ve let a lightning bolt strike it without blatantly showing Yoda make the effort to conjure that lightning. But instead they showed Yoda very clearly putting in effort, concentrating, and blowing up the tree with lightning. I think they did that for a reason. 

I think part of it was Rian’s way of ending Luke’s story, but also giving the next writer the option to utilize Luke in a more creative capacity in Episode 9. No, I’m not implying Luke will come swinging around his green lightsaber as a force ghost in the next movie, that would be ridiculous, but I think there’s precedent now to allow force Luke to have a bigger role than force ghost Yoda or force ghost Obi Wan in the OT. I’m hoping Ghost Luke continues his training of rey(she never learned the third lesson after all) and maybe even manipulates the force in a cool way from the spirit world(so to speak). Would be really interesting to see now that the precedent is there.

[Spoilers] The rebel fetish ruined the new trilogy,"The plot was very forced to act like Episode 6 never happened. They tried to bandaid it with saying that the rebellion and the republic are different but it's just stupid. As stupid as the entire republic being destroyed by a Death Planet. 

And to rub it in, the 2nd movie has the First Order calling everyone rebel scum and saying they're inferior, which is just an awful attempt to make ""The Man"" look oppressive, powerful, and arrogant. And it was just too cliche how they all laugh at one small ship and say ""ho ho you'll never defeat our giant ship"" and to the surprise of no one, the small ship won. 

And then there's the ""spark that'll destroy the first order..."" quote that is just awful and makes it look like they're dealing with the empire. This is not even mentioning the fact that there was no story behind Snoke or that Luke's conclusion after all these years was to just die for no reason after talking a little bit to Rey and Kylo. 

At least the prequels were able to show how the republic operated when dealing with enemies, but the sequels were hamfisted into a rebel vs. empire narrative and you can't just ignore this, it ruined both their own movies and the original trilogy (if you take the sequels as canon.) The prequels made the OT feel much more effective. 

Lastly the jokes, like the opening scene of the movie of insulting General Hux by calling him pasty, or Luke brushing off his shoulders, just completely terrible and the only purpose was to make a quick laugh in the movie theater. 

There's more but the rebel vs. empire plot is just the worst part about it all that ruins the whole plot. Just imagine in 100 years when somebody wants to watch every Star Wars movie in a row, they finish episode 6 in an amazing conclusion only to find a cheap nostalgia kicker for the rest.

Chapter 2

*The City of Milos, 2 ABY*


Varik’s heart was beating so hard, he was afraid the Master himself would be able to hear it all the way from his mansion. Still, everyone else who was crammed into his father’s house seemed fairly calm, so he decided he should try to be calm as well. It didn’t help. He decided finally that his heart was beating not only out of fear, but also excitement, and for that he wasn’t ashamed. He surveyed the room, trying to recognize all the faces. Some of them worked for his father, and some of them were his father’s close friends. He also saw his brothers, and his oldest brother gave him a wave from across the room. He smiled back, trying to look confident. 

As Varik continued to survey the room, he noticed that most of the faces he did not recognize. He hoped that his father had been carful in his choosing of the men that he took into his confidence. In any case, they were all strong, and ready to attend the task at hand, from what Varik could tell from the murmur that permeated the room. That murmur died the moment his father stepped onto the table to address the crowd. 

As Varik looked, he could see the air of someone who was confident in his actions, and steadfast in his resolve. His father scanned the crowd, looking each one in the eye. At last he spoke quietly. “I want to thank each one of you for being here. What we are undertaking is, I think, one of the great moments in our history. So do not have doubts in your minds, or fear in your hearts. I, for one, fear nothing more than slavery, even death. Let our desire for freedom guide us today.” His father paused as everyone in the room nodded silently to each other in agreement. “Now,” he said, in a commanding tone, “the final rundown of the mission. In about seven minutes, the rebel fleet will drop out of hyperspace and start the attack. With the departure of the star destroyer several months ago, they will have no resistance when they make their attack run. As they are unleashing their most powerful ordinance on the garrison and factory, they will send their transport ships to the surface. This is where we come in. Our job is to alert every enslaved family and guide them to the extraction zones, while protecting them from any opposition. Any questions?” A confident “No” swelled across the room. They all knew exactly the part they played, as it had been painstakingly planned for months. “Good. Then I’ll see you all again on the rebel’s ship.” 

With that, Varik’s father stepped down from the table. Varik checked the time. Three minutes. His job was clear: protect his mother and sister and their friends, and get them on the shuttle. Varik smiled. He could almost taste the freedom already. He looked across the room to his father, who was now at the window looking out. He glanced over to Varik and smiled, but Varik knew he was not as confident as he tried to appear. He was concerned about the workers in the factory. There were only a few guards, but they had to evacuate quickly, or risk being inside the building while the rebels were bombarding it. The rebels had made it clear they did not want to allow reinforcements to arrive by delaying a minute, as they were deep in enemy space. 

Varik looked down again, as his timer ticked down. Four, three, two, one… He looked at his father, who was staring intently at the sky. Ten seconds. Twenty seconds. Varik started to feel the panic build as he wondered where the rebels were. “There they are!” shouted his father suddenly, his voice full of excitement and relief, “Go! Go!” In a second, the room emptied as they all streamed into the street. Once he was outside, Varik allowed himself a second to look up at the ships. To him, it was the most beautiful sight he had seen in his life. As he hurried to where his mother was staying, all around him the houses were coming alive. Families were already frantically rushing around, gathering up their essentials, and moving toward the extraction zones. 

Varik hurried down the street, leaving his thoughts behind. He had no time for them right now. He turned into the doorway of the house and pounded on it. After several long moments, it slid open to reveal his mother and sister, and several others behind them. They had already packed and were ready to leave. “Is there any sign of stormtroopers?” said his sister, looking hesitantly into the street. “Don’t worry,” said Varik, with a bit of steel in his voice. “I’ll protect you from any danger. But no, there are no stormtroopers on the streets yet.” He quickly ushered them out of the house and further down the street. They were moving slower than Varik would have liked, because the streets were choked with everyone rushing to the extraction points. 

As the rebel ships entered the atmosphere Varik looked up, and thought he could just hear the distant hum of the engines from the rebel fighters that were streaking toward him. Then, as he looked up into the sky, his heart dropped. He watched as an Imperial star destroyer dropped out of hyperspace. “It’s not possible.” whispered Varik, eyes locked on the star destroyer as it moved into attack position. “What’s wrong?” asked Mara, who had stopped with Varik. He pointed up at the sky. “It’s over. It’s all over.” He said, defeated. He watched as the rebel fighters and transports turned around and returned to their ship. 

Quickly he turned around and shouted, “Follow me!” as he ran back towards their home. He needed to find his father, and fast. Chaos soon became king as others watched the rebel’s retreat. Some stood still in shock, some continued to the extraction points, and still others rushed back to their homes to pretend they had not attempted to escape. 

Varik pushed his way through the crowd, leading his sister and mother back towards where they came from. In the distance, he could see his father trying to calm the crowd, and send them home to hide. “Varik!” he said when he saw his son moving towards him. “What happened father?” said Varik when he reached him. “How did they know?” “I’m not sure,” said his father, his calm demeanor beginning to break down. “They must have discovered one of my messages. But quickly, there is no time. If they know that I planned this, they will surely come for us. You must take your sister and mother, Varik, and get them to safety.” “How?” said Varik, “The rebel ships are gone.” “The docks, Varik.” Said his father, “That’s how I smuggled the messages out. There is a pilot by the name of Takara. His ship is in docking bay 11A7. He will smuggle us to safety. Now go! I’ll find your brothers and meet you there. Go!” 

Varik nodded and hurried away with his mother and sister in tow. He was not yet out of sight when he heard the cry of “Stormtroopers!” from the crowd. He whipped around just in time to see the flash of white armor as they marched into sight. The crowd melted away as the regiment of stormtroopers marched through the street, straight toward Varik’s father. “Halt!” said the imperial officer who led them. Varik knew exactly who he was. His name was Lieutenant Greer, and he was well known among the slaves for his cruelty, and devotion to the Empire. 

“And what is this?” he shouted, addressing the entire crowd. “A celebration? Is it a cultural tradition I’m not aware of? Maybe you all had somewhere to go at the exact same time the rebels attempted an attack? Or perhaps, it was attempt at an escape, aided by those terrorists?” His face turned dark. “Do not take me for a fool!” he screamed, his voice the only sound that echoed throughout the streets. It was filled with hatred for the slaves, a hatred that he did not hesitate to show. “I knew of your plan from the very beginning!” 

Now his voice became sarcastic. “But I must thank you, really. Look to the sky! You saviors have run, damaged and broken! You have helped me score a great victory over the rebels.” A small smile tugged at his face. “And you must be punished for it. Where is your fearless leader?” He looked at Varik’s father, who stood at the fringe of the crowd. “Ah, yes, the famed swoop mechanic. The Master will not be happy to hear this.” 

Varik stood still, in absolute shock. He wanted to run, to protect his father, even though he had no weapon. But his father had told him to keep his sister and mother safe, and he could not leave them. “I must commend you on your efforts,” said Lieutenant Greer, walking towards Varik’s father. The crowd backed away slowly, but his father stood firmly in place, not showing an ounce of fear. Greer crouched down in front of him, reducing the substantial height difference between them. Varik could barely hear him as he spoke. “This is not the first escape attempt I have crushed, but you got much farther that the others. You are a natural leader. Still you were no match for me. What you failed to realize is that for the right price, anything in this galaxy can be bought.” 

“You were betrayed, for a small pouch of credits. It’s actually quite poetic. We could have sold you for much more than the price to betray you. It’s a shame really; the Master wouldn’t want me to damage his goods. Still, an example must be made.” Lieutenant Greer stood and let out a sigh. “I’d like to know, do you regret it?” Varik’s father’s voice resounded throughout the streets in his native language, clearly and without question. “Not for a moment. I will live as a slave no longer. It is only freedom, or death!” Greer nodded slowly as he stepped away, as if in thought. “So be it.” He said, as he turned and drew his blaster. With that, he fired a blaster bolt through the head of Varik’s father. He turned to the stormtroopers. “Find the leaders.” He said calmly. “Kill them all.” 

Varik stood, stunned. Time seemed to move slowly and quickly all at the same time. For what seemed an eternity, he stared at his father’s body. It was still smoking slightly.

Finally the jostle of the crowd brought him back to reality. Everyone was trying to escape the stormtroopers as they swept the streets. It was time to leave. He turned to his sister, who was standing behind him with tears in her eyes. He couldn’t see his mother anywhere. “Where’s Mother?” he said, shaking his sister. “Where did she go?” His sister pointed over his shoulder “To be with Father.” Her voice wavered. Varik turned, panic overtaking him. He couldn’t see her anywhere, and the stormtroopers were fast approaching. “Come on!” he said, slipping into an alleyway. “We need to reach the docks.” “What about mother?” said Mara. “We can’t save her now.

Disney should get to work on an anthology about Kylo Ren in his younger year. Finn Wolfhard from Stranger Thing has the look and potential to be cast as young Kylo Ren.,We need something to fill in the 30 years gap between ROTJ and TFA. Now would be a good time to work on the Solo-Organa family and Kylo Ren's rise and fall to the dark side. Finn Wolfhard would be the perfect candidate.

Just watched Carrie Fisher’s “Postcards from the Edge”,"If you’re a huge Carrie fan (like I am), you need to check out “Postcards from the Edge.” She wrote the book mostly about herself. She wrote the screenplay, and Meryl Streep was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress. The film deals with a movie star, whose addictions and personal struggle threaten to end her career. She is ordered to live with her overbearing superstar mother, as she films her new movie. It’s now streaming on Hulu. It co-stars Dennis Quaid (definitely has some Harrison Ford vibes) and Richard Dreyfuss. Side note: Shel Silverstein (yes, that Shel Silverstein) was nominated for an academy award for best song. Debbie Reynolds actually wanted the part of the mother, but was turned down. Wickedly funny and moving movie and it’s semi-autobiographical. ",StarWars,True,1513195188,2017-12-13

Do you reckon we will ever see grand scale space battles (Clone Wars size) given that the resistance pretty much now physically fits into Millenium Falcon?

Or will the movies ever move in the direction of more than one or two lightsaber wielding users?

I hope we will, but given where EP8 leaves us i doubt it might happen anytime soon.

Why I am worried about the Star Wars franchise,"Star Wars is now owned by Disney.  

To me, this means they *will* keep the franchise squeaky-clean.  We have no real hope for a darker film in my opinion.  I think we can almost all agree that darker story-lines within the Star Wars franchise should be kept as an option.  

Rey - In ""The Force Awakens"", we all saw Rey, the main protagonist, given incredible qualities with almost no weaknesses.  She was a great pilot, a great mechanic, an immediate ""talent"" for the force and skills with a lightsaber that quickly saw her defeat Kylo Ren in battle.  I do get that he was ""injured"" during their fight from a shot by Chewy.  But Kylo has had training from Luke already and just so happens to be a direct offspring of the most powerful Jedi in the era; Anakin Skywalker.  I guess we may find out Rey has some sort of lineage to familiar Jedi, (guessing Obi Won Kenobi), but I don't think anything can fill the plot hole of how she was able to best Kylo Ren in any matter that quickly.  In my opinion, Rey was over-powered as a character due to Disney wanting a strong female lead, and I don't think they will back-track on that.

I also think we can all agree that Star Wars is certainly lacking in the ""gray"" area between the light side and the dark side.  That's why we saw almost a remake of ""A New Hope"" with ""The Force Awakens"" and just a simple re-skin of the Empire and Rebels from the previous films.  I saw a little bit of ""gray"" area touched-up in ""Rogue One"", but certainly get the feeling that will be completely over-powered in ""The Last Jedi"" and Episode 9.

Kylo Ren - I also get the feeling that we will be seeing a lot more of him without his mask.  Nothing major there, but just a disappointment for me.  I also feel like his story and motivations will turn out to lame and over-simplified, but I guess I'll wait to see.

EA - We all know what kind of company EA is, and it's quite disappointing they were awarded exclusive right to all thing Star Wars in the video game industry.  But even seeing the plot in Battlefront 2 showcases exactly what I fear.  I guess I won't spoil the story too much for anyone wanting to play through, but those who are familiar with Iden's plot knows what I am talking about.

Overall, with Disney owning all rights to Star Wars, we will most likely never see a full-on ""adult"" version of Star Wars stories and we will just continue to see the main installments work with cookie-cutter themes of ""Good vs Evil.""  This makes me sad, but I am open to any other optimistic opinions or additional thoughts.

P.S. - I apologize for how thin this post is.  It's a compilation of two years worth of thoughts that I tried to write down all at once.  I may add more later.",StarWars,True,1513200062,2017-12-13

Does anyone else get this vibe? I can’t shake it. 

First off the gun definitely looks too small, even with the old imperial E-11 being as small as it was, this new one is just plain tiny, almost cute. The size combined with the white paint just makes it look almost juvenile. It just doesn’t seem right to me.

It’s IMAX 3D, and a true/full size IMAX screen. Plus it’s one of the very few IMAX Laser theaters in the country, a new projection technology with a super bright, crisp image. It’s how I saw TFA and I can guarantee it’s a blast.

Snoke should've been in it more and not have died, I think it's a waste of a good character.
I'm happy with Reys parents (if what Ren said was true) it was unexpected and more interesting in my opinion.
I also think Finn should've sacrificed himself instead of Rose saving him. It would've showed that the rebellion were struggling, which didn't show in this film.

Just seen the last Jedi (SPOILERS),"Now I know this will get down voted but I have to say it, the movie is not good. Do not read on any further if you have not seen it because I will be discussing plot points after this sentence, you have been warned!

The movie was slow, never got out of first gear and I was taken completely out of the movie with Leia's flying through space scene. I can't think of a way to describe how out of place and just dumb it looked. This is coupled with the Dreadnought ship being unable to destroy a freighter so we are treated to the world's slowest car (space ship) chase in history, which is made ridiculous by the fact that we seen Kylo Ren fly in front of the ship 10 minutes before this when he could have shot the bridge with Leia inside. In a movie titled ""The Last Jedi"", we have about 20 minutes screen time of Ray doing nothing but follow Luke around as he spear fishes and milks alien cows for comedic effect. I have so many more issues with the movie that I can't be bothered typing in right now as it's 4am but the biggest gripe is snoke's death. Like, seriously?

Chapter 3

*Jakku, 34 ABY*

Varik slid his datapad back into his saddlebag. Even after all these years, the memory of his father’s death was painful. He wished he were here to guide him now, to give him council. He wished even more that he could have given him council in the months following the failed attack. Varik remembered well their race to the docks. He remembered crouching in the smugglers hatch not daring to breath, as stormtroopers searched the ship. He especially remembered when the cargo pilot Takara left them on a planet so that he could safely pass through a particularly tough imperial checkpoint. He promised to come back for them. He never did.

 Varik counted himself lucky that he as able to get a job as a skiff driver for the governor. If not, he and his sister may have starved. Not only that, but it was also a chance to show off his skills as a driver, in the hopes of being allowed to enter the local swoop races. They had saved every spare credit in order to buy parts for his homemade swoop. Once he was a racer, they would be happy, and they could go wherever they wanted. Varik sighed and looked to the horizon. It would be light in a few hours. He looked back. Even though he couldn’t see the town, he knew he had not made enough progress. His mount was simply too slow. Varik was never very patient. He was always getting ahead of himself. 

*Rohalla, 14 ABY*

Varik ran into the house, breathless. “I got the ignition leads!” he said to his sister, who was startled be his sudden entrance. “Now I can connect the fuel inhibitor to the release valve!” “How?” asked his sister, confused. “I thought the shipment was coming in two months.” “Well I didn’t exactly buy them…” said Varik hesitantly. “I found them.” His sister looked at him disapprovingly. “Well they were old, and they were going to be thrown out anyway!” said Varik, defensively. “I suppose it’s fine, as long as nobody needed them. But you have to stop cutting corners Varik. You need to build a strong swoop, not something made from second hand parts.” Varik sat down at the table with his sister. “You’re right, as always. But old leads shouldn’t make a difference anyway.”

 “Plus,” he said, drawing closer to her, “with the money I’ve saved, I’ll finally be able to enter the canyon race.” He smiled; but Mara looked at him with reproach. “I told you not to enter that race. It’s too dangerous, and if you crash, the Governor will have your head.” “But I won’t crash.” Said Varik, confidence filling his voice. “The Governor’s skiff will be perfectly safe. And with the winnings, I’ll easily be able to pay for the rest of the swoop. It’s perfect!” “I still think that it’s a bad idea, mark my words. What we should do is use that money to help buy passage off planet. We could move somewhere more… civilized.” Varik scoffed at her. “I know what you really want Mara. But the Republic can’t protect us, they’re just the rebels in disguise. All they have now is legitimacy. They’ve only been in power for ten years, and the control they have over the systems is weak at best. No, I prefer to live away from the Republic’s rule, and you should too. Besides, I promised father I would protect you, and that’s what I’ll do. I’ve got everything under control.”

*Rohalla, 14 ABY*

“Varik, you’re late!” Varik steered his skiff to the starting line along side eleven other skiffs. All the other drivers were watching him intently, trying to size up the new competition. A man watched him impatiently from the ground. He walked over as Varik anchored his skiff. “Are you sure you want to race? Seems like you prefer to move a little slower to me.” Varik ignored him, but the other drivers laughed. They seemed to be quite confident that the new racer would not pose them any risk of losing. 

Varik reached into his pocket and produced a pouch of credits, and tossed it to the man. He looked suspiciously at Varik, and then counted them. “Very well, twelve racers it will be!” he said, addressing all of them. “You all know the route, and it has been loaded into your nav computers. Three laps will determine the winner. Please try not to hit any of the spectators; there will be a few. And you all know the rules? No shortcuts, no intentional damage to the other skiffs. The prize for first place is eighty percent of the entry fees. Second is ten percent, and third is free entry in the next race. All right, prep your skiffs! Race starts in 30 seconds!” 

The man ran to the side of the track and climbed up on a platform. Varik started his skiff and prepped it for the race. As he ran through checklist, he couldn’t help but notice the huge grin that he had on his face. This was where he belonged. This was what he was meant to do. His heart racing, he gripped the controls and looked toward the man standing on the starting platform. He drew a blaster from his side and pointed it across the canyon. Varik leaned into the controls and breathed slowly. He was ready. Suddenly the blaster fired and hit the other wall of the canyon. At that moment, every driver took off in a billowing cloud of dust. The Great Canyon Race had begun.

*Rohalla, 14 ABY*

Varik felt the inertia pull him back as he accelerated as fast as he could. The skiff was a far cry from a swoop in terms of speed and maneuverability, but it was a challenge that Varik accepted with great enthusiasm. All he could think about was that prize money, and how it would solve all of their troubles. He whipped around a corner, neck and neck with another racer. He was in eighth position, and he needed to move up now. 

The racers passed under an overhand, and moments later dodged a bolder that blocked the right side of the track. When he was racing tryouts on his home world, Varik liked to hang toward the middle of the pack until he saw an opening. But skiffs were much bigger than swoops, and passing was going to be difficult. They rounded another corner, and Varik passed smoothly by another racer to move into seventh. The track opened with several turns, and then straightened out for a considerable distance. After three more turns it turned into a loop that brought them back to the start. 
As they hit the straightaway, Varik knew he wouldn’t be able to do much. All he could do was try to keep the dust out of his face. He positioned himself behind the sixth racer and waited for the next turn. As they reached the turn, Varik feigned an inside pass, then swept outside. The racer ahead of him swooped inside to block him, but in doing so moved off her line and had to break hard. Varik easily passed her on the outside. The walls of the canyon extended up high on each side for almost the entire course. Not only did it make for the perfect track, it protected them from being caught. If they were, they would be punished by the Governor, who had outlawed such races. However out of all the racers, Varik was the only one who was racing a skiff that belonged to the Governor. 

As they rounded the loop towards the starting line, Varik sat in fifth place. They roared across the line as he inched up next to the skiff ahead of him. The driver looked back, a sneer on his face. He swerved and bumped Varik’s skiff off course. Undeterred, Varik stuck with him as they entered the first turn. Now he was even with the driver, passing him on the right side. He turned to look at the driver, who was smiling now. Varik looked ahead, and to his horror saw the bolder that blocked the track fast approaching. With the skiff to his left holding him in place, he could do nothing but watch as he barreled onward to his doom. Then as they passed under the overhang, Varik slammed his clearance control forward. His skiff shot up, clearing the bolder by mere inches. The skiff next to him, no longer having something to push against, veered into the giant rock and crashed. Varik reversed the clearance control to minimum and fell back to the ground safely. He was now in third place, as he had jumped another driver during the maneuver. A quick smile cracked his face as relief washed over him.

As they entered the straightaway, he looked behind him to check the other racers. The crash had slowed them down considerably, and the gap between the first four skiffs and the rest of the pack was only widening. Varik looked ahead and settled in. Only two more moves to make. They moved into the first turn as they exited the straightaway. Varik cut inside, but to no avail. On the second turn he feigned inside and cut outside, but he was still blocked expertly by the skiff ahead of him. On the final turn before the loop, Varik swept outside than cut in. He was finally able to trick the driver ahead and pulled up next to him. 

But now Varik was in trouble. He was stuck on the outside going into the loop. Unwilling to give up his foothold, he pushed the skiff to it’s limit as they entered the long curve. Then the swoop on his inside started to drift out and the two skiffs met with a crash. The driver continued to drift, and in a panic, Varik realized that he was trying to push him into the canyon wall. His head swiveled back and forth between the wall and the skiff, as its driver inched him closer to the wall. Varik tried to push back, but he simply didn’t have enough leverage. When he was just inched from the wall, he panicked and slammed on the breaks, but it was too late. The skiff struck the rock wall with a crunch and spun out of control across the canyon. It hit the other wall and crashed to the ground, throwing Varik from his seat. He fell to the ground, unconscious.

*Rohalla, 14 ABY*

“He did what!” the Governor rose from his chair in a rage, and started to pace back and forth across the hall, his cloak flapping behind him. “Crashed it Sir. Apparently they were racing in the canyon again.” “Well, did you bring it back? What does it look like?” yelled the Governor, anger filling his voice. “Sir…” The guard dropped his eyes, unable to hold the steely gaze of the Governor. “It’s… destroyed. Completely Sir. It’s a mess.” 
The Governor’s gaze dropped to Varik, who was kneeling between two guards. His head was still pounding from the crash, and the Governors’ yelling was only making it worse. “So, this is how you repay me? After I give you a job others would kill for? After I pay you, and feed you, and give you a home? You take my property and destroy it! Why?!” Varik raised his head meekly, and tried to answer. “Enough!” said the Governor, walking back to his chair. “I have no time for your excuses anyway. Where is the other one?” “They’re bringing her now Sir.” The guard pointed to the door on the other side of the room. “Good, good.” Said the Governor calmly, walking back to his chair. “We will sort this out, yes we will.” 

“Now,” he said as he sat down. Two guards brought Mara in front him. “I am a fair man, so here’s what I’ll do. You pay me for the skiff, and I will allow you to leave, unpunished!” finally Varik spoke. “I do not have the funds to pay you Sir.” “What? What’s that?” said the Governor, confused. “What is he say—Oh!” he snapped his fingers, “I forgot you can’t speak basic. Um, where is that translator droid?” he said, looking around the room. “ Ah, there! Come here you, C-whatever. Can you translate that language?” “Of course Sir.” Said the droid. “He said that he is unable to pay you.” “I see, I see...” the Governor sarcastically mused. “Does he have anything he can sell to make up the difference?” “No sir, I do not.” Varik said, fearfully. Not even his half built swoop could pay for the skiff. “I’m afraid not Sir.” The droid said. 

The Governor nodded slowly, as if deep in thought. Suddenly he jumped from his chair, rubbing his hands together. “Well son, that’s where you’re wrong. You see, you have something that can recoup my losses, you just didn’t think of it because your brain is so small. Your sister.” Varik’s eyes filled with horror, and his head snapped to look at his sister, who looked back in confusion and fear. “Yes, I should be able to sell her for a hefty price.” Said the Governor.” “Of course I hate to do it, but it’s really the principal of the thing. I’m sure you understand.” He said, patting Varik on the head. 

As he turned to walk away, Varik screamed “Please! I’ll do anything! Take me instead, I’m begging you!” the Governor smiled as he walked away. “Still can’t understand you.” He said. “What should we do with him Sir?” asked the guard. “Get him off planet.” Yelled the Governor, as Varik pleaded incessantly. “Dump him anywhere. Dump him on Jakku.”

I watched through each movie like I had been waiting for it to come out in the theater, and watching them in that light (versus just knowing what happens next) was just so cool.

Best replica Lightsabers?,"Hey everyone, after watching TLJ I've found myself really wanted a nice replica lightsaber that's decent price and decent quality.

I haven't decided if I want one with a pommel or not yet, but if I do, I'd preferably want a removable one. 

I have a budget of about $300 so I really want something that is decent quality.

I've seen ultrasabers pop up a lot but I've seen some bad reviews from a few years ago so I don't know how decent they are.

Lost all interest in episode IX now after seeing TLJ.,"For the record, I loved TFA and Rogue One.

As a standalone narrative, TLJ was an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. But as a SW film, and as a follow on to TFA, I am so disappointed, to the point now where I really don't care for episode IX or what happens with the rest of this storyline. 


All the loose ends were dealt with, and plot points/story arcs set up in TFA were abruptly crushed in TLJ with no satisfactory outcome. Snoke, Rey's parentage, Ben/Kylo's origin, Luke's storyline etc. 

I really don't care what happens now with Rey/Finn/the resistance and vulnerable/conflicted Ben Solo just isn't a formidable antagonist for an entire film.

Bottom line: I feel *so* sorry for JJ Abrams - he created an excellent, polished film with TFA, which created a whole new story arc with enough mystery to sustain two sequels and intriguing/mysterious characters like Kylo, Rey and Snoke, yet in the space of one film, Rian has screwed up those narratives, removed any sense of mystery and anticipation and left episode IX with no real story to follow up with. I feel sorry for JJ Abrams having to handle episode 9 after the mess Rian has left him.

Looking forward to Solo and any other spin-offs, but don't care for episode IX anymore, unless JJ Abrams can pull off a miracle and salvage it with something more refined and redeeming.

Opinions on a star wars game but in a call of duty first person shooter style game?,Having another company work on the star wars franchise and starting from the bottom testing the waters on a storm trooper vs. rebels like the movies.

It occurrs to me that droids would have some sort of occular zoom, being robots and all, and shouldn't require the use of binoculars. I'm sure there are many rationalizations on why they might use an external image enhancement device, but it just struck me as bizarre.

Andy serkis says Snoke is more powerful than palpatine and darth vader..,Thoughts about that? I dont like it.. ,StarWars,True,1512343041,2017-12-03
So why has the ST (thus far) just totally forgotten the existence of force ghosts...,"Before I begin, I want to emphasize on me saying ""thus far""... That is all of TFA, surrounding books/games, and everything we know of for TLJ thus far. This topic may be rendered obsolete within the next 2 weeks at TLJ's release, and to that possibility I say hurrah...

But ever since ""Force Ghost's"" conception, they have been largely underutilized. Who can forget the first time we heard Obi-Wan's pre-sacrificial line in ANH, ""If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful then you can possibly imagine"". By more powerful, he means popping in the scene every now and then to give advice to Luke during crutch moments. As far as we know (strictly by the films anyways), Force Ghosts can't even interact with the environment or interfere. Obi-Wan popped in to Luke as he collapsed in the snow. Then disappeared to leave him to die. It was Han's (a live person) intervention that saved Luke. 

But hey, its better then nothing. And its a cool way of keeping characters present in the story past their death. And oh look at the end of ROTJ, we see Yoda and Anakin come back too. Awesome! Ever since I saw that as a kid, it made me hopeful that we would see all three characters come back for future films, a possible Episode VII even. Then TFA came out... Other then some very vague voice clips in a force vision, we didn't see anything... Its like they were completely ignored. Hoping TLJ finds some use for them, especially now that Luke is being incorporated into the story. Luke being the one who has shown interacting with them. I guess where I'm going with this.... I miss Yoda and Obi-Wan. I would love to hear their opinions on Luke's existential crisis and thinking ""it's time for the Jedi to end"".  I see a lot of potential there. And if they are left out, I believe that will represent a huge missed opportunity for TLJ.",StarWars,True,1512343724,2017-12-03

The Ideal Star Wars Video Game,"Imagine an open world first person Star Wars game in a Star Citizen-esque setting. Basically you naturally transition between fighting land battles in expansive destructible environments with lots of vehicles to doing things in space.

One example of a large mission would have you commanding a small fleet of Venator class star destroyers in the clone wars as a Jedi general.

You start the mission by receiving orders from the Jedi council to go to a star system, steal plans for an experimental battle droid, destroy the federation droid factory, and retreat. This mission is urgent, you do not have the time to recon the system, your only option is a full frontal assault.

You radio the pilots and command them to warp the fleet into orbit around the planet the factory is based on. During warp you may customize your equipment for the mission and adjust your personal Interceptor.

You arrive in orbit of the planet the factory is based on and the alert is sounded as you've been detected by the Federation. They're sending ships to intercept your fleet and charging their anti-ship ground cannons.

You send out a 3 fleets. One to take down the anti-ship cannons on the ground, one to intercept the enemy fighters coming at your fleet, and one to escort your ground team to invade the factory.

Joining the ground team you can choose to escort the ground team in your Interceptor, fly a Republic Gunship, operate a gun on a Republic Gunship, or be transported in the Republic Gunship. You choose to go in your Interceptor and destroy enemy fighters as your team enters the atmosphere.

As you arrive on the ground team you have access to a myriad of options to invade the enemy base and can command your ground troops, the 406th legion. Each trooper colored in purple bearing an octopus sigil.

You try to enter using stealth and are successful at first but as soon as you start downloading the plans you are detected. The droid commander takes the plans before you finish downloading them and activates the experimental battle droids to intercept your unit.

You are now surrounded by battle droids. After a hard fought battle, losing several clones, you are able to defeat the droids but now more are on their way. You split up your team, sending a squad of clones to plant the bomb in the reactor as you chase down the droid commander bearing the plans.

Your clone squad is sacrificed but is able to plant the bomb. Before the timer runs out your squad and the droid commander escape in separate federation star ships, watching the factory explode as you fly into orbit.

As you enter orbit you're able to board the droid commander's ship, kill him, and steal the plans. As you do this a fleet of Federation Cruisers warp into orbit.

You order your now outnumbered force to retreat. You discover the anti-ship cannon team failed and now your Venators are being bombarded from both sides. The shields fail. You see escape pods launched before the ships explode and now Federation forces are hunting down surviving Republic ships.

You try to rescue survivors but are soon discovered to be separate from the Federation fleet, you barely escape with your ship's engine damaged. The engine can only withstand two jumps before it explodes. You warp to a planet in Federation space to repair your ship and call for Republic reinforcements.

You land on the planet and hire a local mechanic to fix your ship. Your ship is fixed and you're able to send a signal for backup with a Venator from a another fleet on it's way to get you. Everything goes well until you pay the mechanic. Because you don't have enough credits so you try to mind trick him into letting you go and you fail. The mechanic is smart however and leads you to believe you succeeded. Right as you leave he signals the Federation to intercept you.

As you leave you see the same fleet that throttled you warp into orbit and you have to fight your way on the Republic Venator. Before the shields go down you're able to dock and warp in to Republic space.

You have completed your mission at great cost. Chancellor Palpatine himself gives you a medal for your efforts and sacrifice.",StarWars,True,1512353870,2017-12-03

Do u guys think that TLJ will end with a cliffhanger or a sense of resolution...,"You can't really predict things in terms of Star Wars endings in this manner. Obviously III and VI both ended with a heavy sense of resolution being the conclusion of their two trilogies. I am sure IX will follow suit. But looking at other films is a mixed apples. ESB and TFA ended on pretty stark cliffhangers... TFA's ending felt like a dirty tease cutting off right before the pay off. ESB ended right after a HUGE pay off or bomb shell rather with little time to explore its ramifications and what it means. Finally Episodes I and IV both ended with a pretty ribbon on top with a pretty solid sense of resolution while keeping things open for a sequel. Episode II was somewhere in the middle ending right after a huge galactic war breaks out. 

So I wonder how TLJ ends. I kind of hope they don't do the cliffhanger route. Things work better when there is only one of those per trilogy. And its kind weird they decided to theirs at the beginning with VII. So I hope VIII ends off in a more stable place with less of a tease then TFA did. While of course keeping things open for IX.

Could The Clone Wars continue?,"OK, first of all let me say 2 things to anyone who did not like the Clone Wars series or fans who truly don't believe it could return, please understand that this is speculation. Second of all, since the voice acting and pre-animated figures are done for the unfinished episodes, would it cost them to fully animate them? I mean from a business point of view, they would make more money, and I don't see why Disney doesn't want that especially since they've done some pretty bad things also(they joked about the Japanese during the world wars, have been racist, have inappropriate/suggestive content in movies) and Disney makes Marvel movies that has blood and violence, plus since their show Star Wars Rebels is supposed to be darker in the future season couldn't the Clone Wars finish. The way I see it, more people would like them or give them a second chance with Star Wars. And they don't even need the voice actors like Ashley Eckstein or Matt Later cause the voices are there, so if they're of losing fans or whatever couldn't they just only release it on Neflix or on DVD so don't have to rival with Cartoon Network or be worried about losing viewers? I mean although it doesn't seem hopeful now, I someday hope the unfinished episodes of TCW would get fully animated with the same animation style.

Thoughts on the Thrawn trilogy?,"I recently bought Heir to the Empire, after inquiring about Phasma the other week. Some of you may remember the post. Well, I went back to Barnes &amp; Noble for their Black Friday weekend sale and Phasma was gone. Someone had snagged it in the 3 days I was waiting for the sale to start. 

I was perusing the Star Wars section, entirely distraught for what book I should start with. I was caught by the new Thrawn book by Timothy Zahn. I took caution with it as I didn’t want to waste $30 on a book I might never actually pick back up after my initial read (A short 30 minute read. I was never one for books, but video games aren’t as attention grabbing anymore.).


I visited my old Phasma post, and I skimmed through the comments looking for suggestions on what to read. With so many options, I narrowed it down to the Thrawn trilogy and Inferno Squad. I decided to go with Heir to the Empire first, not purchasing all 3 because, like I said, I didn’t want to waste my money on something I might never pick back up. Needless to say, I’m hooked, and in the first 10 pages too. With my busy schedule, it’s hard to find time to sit down, relax, and delve into the book for a long period of time. However, I can’t wait to see what the next two books bring.

It is on the Episode 3 track named “The Birth of The Twins and Padme’s Destiny” at 2:00.

They aren’t exactly the same though. I’m pretty sure the one in Episode 1 has more men and is lower than the one in Episode 3 with it sounding higher and like more women are singing it.

"After years of avoiding it, I finally rewatched Attack of the Clones, and loved it","Historically, AOTC has been my least favorite Star Wars movie. Even as a kid, I didn't like it compared to Episode one and, later, Episode three. As a teen and adult, I found the movie to be dull, meandering, poorly written, and ugly. 

However, As part of my rewatching the saga before TLJ, I rewatched AOTC for the first time in ages and enjoyed it far more than I remembered. The first act especially was enjoyable. I loved the way GL shot and paced the chase scene on Coruscant, and the general Star Wars Noir feeling that continues through much of the film was great.  Anakin and Obi Wan have a great, complicated relationship, and Hayden Christensen's acting didn't bother me nearly as much as I remember.

True, it had significant flaws. My girlfriend (who really only ever watched the OT and the new films) had trouble keeping the names of the side characters straight, which resulted in her being confused as to what was going on in some scenes. The whole sifo-dias thing is poorly explained. And of course, the Anakin-Padme love story had way too much said, and too little implied. But I loved the scenes of them flirting that worked, and the eventual payoff with them in the colosseum on geonosis worked for me.

What’s your Star Wars Shorthand?,"Obviously most sane people are not going to refer to a Star Wars film by its full name in normal conversation. 


“So, I was watching Star Wars Episode VI: The Empire Strikes Back the other day...” just doesn’t roll off the tongue.


What’s your conversational shorthand for each film?


Mine is as follows:

Menace
Clones
Sith
Rogue
Hope
Empire
Jedi
Awakens

Numerical is probably the easiest solution, but being old as shit, the numbers weren’t the norm when I first experienced Star Wars.  While in the crawl since the ‘80 re-release, they weren’t really a “thing” until the prequels. 


The Last Jedi now presents a challenge to my eco-system because Jedi has been taken for 34 years and Last could get confused with whatever the most current film is, making it useful for less than 6 months.

Theory - TWO New Lightsaber Colors/Hues And Endgame (Episode IX) Prediction,"With the most recent development that we MIGHT see a new lightsaber hue in TLJ, many have speculated that Luke will have a white saber, representing the fact that he is now a grey Jedi (or whatever they will call it in new canon). 

BUT, if this is the case, I don't think it would be too far beyond the realm of possibility for Snoke to have a black lightsaber, or possibly even the Darksaber from TCW/Rebels. (He does, after all, apparently have a black kyber crystal ring, so that's where I drew the connection).

Imagine seeing Luke with a white saber, Snoke with a black saber, Rey with a blue saber and Kylo with a red saber. There has been some talk of a Force spectrum/scale (don't remember the source, sorry) upon which all of these characters will fall, ranging from pure light to pure dark. Perhaps these lightsaber colors will designate at which point in the scale they all are. And if I had to guess, I'd say Luke and Snoke are BOTH around the center, hence their white and black colors.

So this would mean that by the end of Episode IX, the Chosen TWO - Kylo and Rey - will both reach that middle point, finally bringing balance to the Force like the prophecy foretold.",StarWars,True,1512416325,2017-12-04

Star Wars from a millennial point of view,"Having just been recently obsessed with star wars and rewatching the movies these are how i’d rank them.

1 - Revenge of the Sith
2 - The Force Awakens
3 - Rouge One
4 - Clone Wars Series
5 - Return of the Jedi
6 - Empire Strikes Back
7 - Attack of the Clones
8 - The Phantom Menace
9 - A New Hope
[Haven’t Seen Rebels]

Revenge of the sith was easily the best movie for me. Watching the slow transformation of anakin into vader was an amazing story. I actually teared up when the Jedi were being slaughtered by the clones.

I really wanted to enjoy the old movies, for what they did for the franchise but they were honestly hard to get through sometimes. I found myself having to rewatch scenes because i wasnt paying attention. I hated the fight scenes, but the dialogue was the best of all the films.

The most surprising for me was the clone wars series. I started watching it just with my son but found myself getting super attached to the characters and all the stories. It was really well done.

I like the direction the new movies are going, and im glad disney took over and made all the old stuff non canon. So new fans like me can get into the series. I’ve really enjoyed reading the comics so far and am starting to read all the novels in order. 

For what i want to see in the future trilogy would be ‘the old republic’

For the live action tv series, i’d like to see ‘underworld’ with a game of thrones (adult) vibe

For a new animated series id like to see ‘ROTJ-TFA’ with the clone wars type stories",StarWars,True,1512419108,2017-12-04

"[Serious! What if - Discussion] If H. Ford didn’t wanted to leave Star Wars, do you think Kylo would have killed ....","instead of his father, Chewbacca? 

**Short Spoiler about „Legends“ following:**

Chewie died in Legends, in the first Novel of the Vong war. It left Han splitted up inside, blaming his son (Anakin) indirectly for it and leaded to a very intresting storyline within that whole 19 books

** End of Spoiler**

Han is already torn apart, left everything to escape reality, tried to get back in a time before Leia. Before Kylos betrail.

Kylo is torn apart because of his past, the still existing band to his family which „weakens“ him in his opinion. Chewbacca surely played a big role in his youth, as he is the best friend of the family, and instead of breaking the bridges to his family by killing his father, he could have gone this way.

A way more crucial, way more brutal way would have been IMO to kill Chewbacca and spare Han/Leia. It would have been the point of no return but instead of hurting only Leia/Luke (and Chewie), he would have hurt all of his family left, would have forced Han to react, to switching from disappointment about kylo/himself to hate. 

Pure hate, which is something we never saw on Han. He was always the „wana be“ baddy but in his heart he was a good man. Getting his friend of nearly 50 years getting killed by his son would have opened some incredible fascinating new plotlines in TLJ / Episode 9.

Why do people hate star wars all of a sudden?,"Title. Everywhere I look on YouTube, I see commentators going off about how star wars has gone to the shitter, the market is oversaturated with star wars, and how Disney is milking the franchise dry.

Firstly, TFA was a good movie, and no where near as bad as people try to make it out to be. Honest criticism is perfectly fine of course; I have my own problems with it as well (Starkiller base, resistance, Poe's absence, Rey being the main character, etc), but calling it worse than the prequels is just absurd. It was a good, well put together film with a few too many homages to ANH. I don't mean that badly towards people who like the prequels of course.

Star wars has always been about merchandise, and I honestly don't think anyone milked it more than Lucas himself. Disney making two movies and selling merchandise is nothing new. That's honestly all I have for that one.

Rogue One: What is Jyn's motivation in the second half?,"I knew in the first half she didn't really care to be involved in either side. She said something to the effect that it doesn't matter if you don't raise your head high enough to see whatever flag was raised.

[SPOILERS] And then obviously she had the motivation in the first half to see her father. But then once Galen dies things get a little murky for me.

Jyn realizes what Cassian was actually up to. Not a good look for the Rebellion in Jyn's eyes with assassination orders and against her father no less. She even mentioned it was Rebel ships that bombed the platform that killed Galen. Then Cassian gives his little speech about how things aren't always black and white essentially. 

It just seems that Jyn would call bullshit on the whole thing and leave based on what transpired since in her eyes both sides seem like full of shit.

And then all of a sudden she's talking at Yavin 4 in front of Mon Mothma where's she's inspirationally trying to encourage everyone they have to fight. Was Cassian's speech that effective? I can see her trying to honor her father and his legacy of building a hitch in the death star plans, but I just feel like there's a scene missing in between Cassian's speech and Yavin 4 where they could fully show her buying into actively fighting for the Rebellion.

Anyone else feel this, or am I just missing something? I mean I know the answer is supposed to be Revenge, but I feel like they could have sold the character getting to that point a little better.

To all the people who say operation Cinder isn't a super weapon I give to you the Ion Ring.,"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ion_Ring

This goes back, way way back to the old Marvel '77 comics and newpaper strips. Seen in ""The Second Kessel Run"" and collected in ""Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures"" we have the Ion Ring. 

The Ion Ring was a satellite with a beam that could enhance the weather of a planet and be used in terraforming. However an Imperial commander Bzorn (You have to love old comic names smh) saw it as a weapon. Bzorn commandeered the ship, and the Ion Ring was turned into a military weapon, unleashing destructive storms on planets sympathetic to the Rebel cause.

Huh? Is this starting to sound familiar to Operation Cinder yet? A satellite capable of causing world ending storms? (You have to love how deep the SG will go into SW history to come up with stories it really shows how much they love the universe). And its even on the Legends Super-weapons list.

Or the Orbital Night Cloak that was re purposed solar mirrors used to divert sunlight from a planet and turn it into an ice ball? 

Now now I know what some might be saying ""But it doesn't destroy the world just all life on it"". Well I've heard that before and if that is the case then we need to take the Hyperspace Nullifier, The Corsair, Sun Razer (think KOTOR/TOR era Maw instalation), Ascendant Spear (Not to sure why its on this list to begin with. Only thing special is its mind link interface which you would think SW would already have), Planet Prision, Death Mark Laser (Kill sats. Another thing you would think would be common in SW), The Conqueror, Dark Reaper, Baradium missles, The Devastation and Malevolence, Eye of Palpatine (Large troop transport), Elctro-Proton Bomb, Interplanetary Ion Cannons,  Omega Frost, The Gauntlet,  The Silencer,  (Why do so many of these come from either SWTOR or the early Marvel comics), Thought Bomb, Shadow Arsenal, Metal-Crystal Phase Shifter, Visual Electromagnetic Intensifier, Two-Wave, Gravshock Device, Null Canon (EMP canon), Yo'gand's Core Tactic off the list because none of them destroy the planet as a whole but only make it uninhabitable, destroys lots of ships at once, or is a unique weapon. 

Or ""But it wasn't made as a weapon and was only repurposed and turned into one"" in which case we need to take Centerpoint station, Cosmic Turbine, Hyperspace collisions (Pilot malfunction was a superweapon?), Orbital Nightcloak (Satellites directing sun away from a planet causing a ice age),Star Forge (I think we all know what this one does) , World Devastators, Hammer Station, Infinity Gate,   Dark Matter.

So that's 25 form the first list and 9 from the last list giving use a total of 34 cutting the original number of Legends super weapons in half. 

I know the list wasn't really necessary but those are the two main arguments I've seen about why its not a superweapon. But I'm ok with superweapons because as another user said a while ago.

So yeah either Operation Cinder is a superweapon or 34 Legends Superweapons including some of the major ones like the World devastators and Star Forge aren't superweapons 

&gt;So when writers for the books or comic or game want to create plot many times they will pull a super weapon because to them and to the readers that represents Star Wars.

&gt;The second reason is that it is easy to make the plot into a small self-contained and personal story. A story that is really good for a single book or a short small Trilogy of books. It gives a single hard objective for Our Heroes to overcome and one that does not need much background explanation for anyone new and jumping in....it's intrinsic part of Star Wars and creates a simple easy part for our Heroes to go up against as well as creating a good jumping-off point for any new readers.",StarWars,True,1512443188,2017-12-04

"Qui-Gon Jinn Could have bought both Anakin and his mother, but didn't.","I've been rewatching Episode I and I noticed something kind of odd. Through his bets with Watto and the sale of the Pod, Qui-Gon has more then enough money at the end of the pod race to buy both Anakin and his mother, but he doesn't. 

There are two major bets placed in the film;

1) Qui-Gon suggests that Watto pay the entry fee to the race, with the expectation that if they win, Watto gets to  keep all the winnings minus the parts that they need to fix the hyper drive. Note: Watto believes the Pod Racer is Qui-Gon's property at this point.

2) In the Pod Race Hangar a second bet is placed for Anakin and Shmi Skywalker after Watto says he is betting everything on Sebulba. Qui-Gon states he'll take the bet but Watto rebuffs him saying that no Pod is worth 2 slaves. So Qui-Gon settles for the boy in the chance roll cube.

So here's a breakdown of what Qui-Gon wins because of Anakin's triumph in the race

1) The Hyper Drive to repair the ship
2) Anakin's Freedom

If he loses:

1) He forfeits the Ship
2) He forfeits the Pod/Anakin remains a slave.

When he wins, he still has the Pod which we know is worth 1 slave.

In the subsequent scene Anakin runs to his mother saying they sold the pod and have a bunch of money. Remember: Anakin is free at this point and Watto lost everything to other debt collectors. 

So why doesn't Qui-Gon offer to buy Shmi? Is this just a plot hole that Lucas overlooked?

EDIT: I want to reemphasize something that a lot of people seem to be missing in regards to my post. Its that Qui-Gon had the means to purchase Shmi after the race but never even offered to do so. ",StarWars,True,1512444489,2017-12-04

Serious Porg Theory: The Porgs are Chewbacca’s cats,"I had an epiphany tonight. The porgs are Chewbacca’s pets. It’s been a way for him to cope since the loss of Han Solo. So just like how people in mourning will sometimes get a pet to cope with the loss of a loved one, Chewbacca has porgs to fill the hole in his heart. It’s not going to be fair to Chewy’s character to not address the death of Han Solo. So the porgs exist as a way for him to look after something, like he looked after Han. 

John Boyega recently said the Millennium Falcon has a “porg hole”. That’s when it dawned on me. Chewy even made a way for the porgs to easily enter and exit the MF. They’re Chewy’s cats. 

I believe in this theory so strongly that I will be a little disappointed if they aren’t Chewy’s pets. I also believe this will make the character of the porg more tolerable if the porg has emotional weight to Chewy’s mourning. The Last Jedi has to address Chewy’s loss after the way TFA kind of ignored it.

She is completely opposite of Luke where he failed miserably many times at the start. I mean what Rey can improve upon now?what can change in her flawless personality? However when I look at Kylo, he is deeply flawed. His anger, his confliction between light and darkness, his mixed feelings and he just got beaten by teen girl with zero training. He has so much thing to improve and his personality can change majorly. I just wish the series would focus more on Kylo Ren instead of giving 90% of the screen time to Rey and Finn.

“That Boy is Our Last Hope.” “No. There is Another.” Some Questions About Luke’s Training with Yoda,"So I’m in the midst of watching The Empire Strikes Back, and this whole training thing with Yoda introduces a lot of interesting ideas about the plot with Luke both during and after his dealings with the Empire.

1. First off, what is the deal with the whole scene in the cave with Vader? Yoda tells Luke that he will only find what he brings with him, and that he doesn’t need any weapons. Nevertheless, Luke brings his lightsaber and blaster, encounters Vader, then kills him, only to find that it his himself (with an eye missing) in the mask. What does this whole scene symbolize?

2. Secondly, I’d like to talk about Luke’s decision to cut his trading with Yoda short to go save Han/Leia. Yoda talks about how this will destroy everything that they’ve fought and suffered for, and that it would be an unwise decision that would only lead him to the dark side, similar to the path that Anakin took. Although he cut his training short, he still went on to successfully destroy the empire, and so it simply makes it seem as if Yoda was wrong. However, could it rather be that this choice to not finish his training was the one that caused him to fail to train the Jedi in between episodes 6 and 7 and led to the disaster with the Knights of Ren and whatnot?

3. Lastly, I was wondering what Yoda meant when Luke was leaving. As Luke leaves, Obi-Wan says, “That boy is our last hope,” to which Yoda replies, “No. There is Another.” Who the HECK is he talking about? I would like to think that it’s maybe Rey but there’s no way that scriptwriters were thinking about episode 7 in 1980 and so I’m just honestly confused. Is this a plot hole or something that I am missing or what?

TL;DR
When Luke is training with Yoda on Dagobah:
1. What does the whole scene with Luke and Darth Vader in the cave symbolize?
2. Does Luke’s decision to not complete his training result in his failure to train Jedi and cause the uprising of the Knights of Ren?
3. Who is the “other hope” that Yoda refers to?

A couple of questions about the Tantive IV and Captain Raymus Antilles,"So Raymus Antilles was the captain of Tantive IV which was the ship that escaped Scariff with the Death Star plans by jumping to hyperspace, however they were somehow followed by Vader’s flagship the Devastator. I’ve seen all the movies, both TV shows, most of the comics and one book, and i don’t recall a single instance where a ship escapes through hyperspace and isn’t “homefree”. Obviously it’s really just a continuity error between movies written decades apart, but usually there is a half decent explanation for these types of errors, and I’m wondering if there’s anything in canon that clears this up?

Second question is regarding Raymus Antilles and Wedge Antilles. I’d always assumed that they were father and son but after looking into it i couldn’t find anything that explicitly says they are, so I’m curious if anyone can answer that as well. Seems odd to give the same last name to two characters both involved in the Alliance. ",StarWars,True,1511501981,2017-11-24

Why didn't the Empire destroy the Tantive IV (the ship carrying the Death Star plans)?,"We learn in Ep. 6 that the Empire is capable of rebuilding the Death Star. How would this be possible without using  a copy of the original Death Star Plans (they have six years to rebuild the second death star, when it took them almost 20-25 years to build the first one IIRC). I don't think they could have finished the project in that time unless they had already had a copy of the Death Star plans. 

If that's the case, why bother chasing the rebels for the plans? Why not destroy the ship? We learn in Rogue One that Vader absolutely knows the plans are on the Tantive IV. If the Empire had a copy of the plans, why not destroy the enemy that's holding the other copy I understand Leia's on the ship as well, but even when Vader has her prisoner, he makes no attempt to turn her to the dark side.

Anakin not having a green lightsaber,"I've been watching a lot of Star Wars prequel videos and a lot of people are questioning why Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber colour is blue instead of a expected green, so i'll explain why.

So Anakin didn't have a green lightsaber, but this seems very strange, the colour of green in a lightsaber represents Jedi who are extremely powerful with the force and Anakin was literally created by the force so why didn't he have a green one?

As strange as it is, Anakin has never really cared about the force as much as he probably should have, now of course he still is very powerful with it but he always has prefered his physical abilities over his telapathic abilities: obviously however later on in his life as Darth Vader his bad suit had him use the force a lot more to basically survive and fight.

So Anakin recieved a blue lightsaber crystal since it signifies his power or however you put it. but if the prequels made sense with certain things then i think Anakin's lightsaber  would have turned green somewhere sround the start of Revenge of the Sith as well as red when he raided the Jedi temple: highliting his allegiance to the Sith

So what do you think: should Anakin have had a green lightsaber and would you have prefered him with a green one or are you fine with him having a blue one? i hope this cleared things up!",StarWars,True,1511546617,2017-11-24

The starfighter battles are intense, with some weird controls at points, but it feels like a true Star Wars game.

I HIGHLY recommend watching The Phantom Menace from the perspective of someone who has never seen Star Wars.,"I'm rewatching all the films to get ready for The Last Jedi (of course), and I just got done with Episode 1. Since I'm doing a chronological order rewatch, I decided to do something different: watch the story unfold as if I was a first time viewer- as if I had just picked up a book titled ""Star Wars"" and the first page just happened to be a about a pair of Jedi Warriors on a diplomacy mission to Naboo....


...Oh man, it made this movie way more fun. I know for myself personally, when I watch TPM as a ""prequel"", I'm purely watching it in context of the original trilogy- and that's honestly a less satisfying way to watch this movie. There's so much here that exists for its own sake, apart from any connections to the rest of the saga. So rather than waiting impatiently for the relevant bits that foreshadow the OT, I was just letting this story unfold on its own terms, if that makes any sense. 

And once you can do that, it's actually a pretty fun and interesting story. The immediate conflict has moderately high stakes- we're talking about the fate of a planet, after all- but there's also constant hints towards an even larger conflict on the horizon. You're not totally sure who these Jedi or Sith are, or what his ""chosen one"" stuff is all about, but it becomes clear that whatever our characters have been drawn into is much more than just a trade dispute. 

And even beyond the big story beats, its really cool watching all the little details and visuals from the perspective of someone who has no pre-knowledge; all the ""stuff"" of the Star Wars world that we take for granted becomes a series of delightful little discoveries. Anyways, I definitely recommend it. ",StarWars,True,1511562251,2017-11-24

Question about Luke's whereabouts between Episodes V and VI,"I want to preface this question with the disclaimer that I'm a very casual Star Wars fan. I love the series, but my knowledge of much of the expanded universe (I guess it's called ""Legends"" now) is small at best.

Anyways, I was curious to know if Luke went back to Dagobah to continue his training between Episodes V and VI? I realize that in Episode VI it heavily implies that he didn't (when he goes back to Yoda, asking to continue his training, and Yoda says something along the lines of ""Nah you're good. Just go face Vader bruh,"") but I just find it strange that Luke seems so much more confident at the beginning of VI than he does at the end of V, even going as far as calling himself a Jedi Knight.

As far giving himself the title of Jedi Knight, the previously mentioned conversation with Yoda can explain that. It basically tells us that Luke was calling himself that without actually having earned the title. I believe he says something like ""So I AM a Jedi"" and Yoda quickly tells him he's not until he faces Vader.

But that still leaves me curious as to where the new found confidence, both in himself, his force abilities, and even in his lightsaber skills, that he has at the start of VI comes from. In the first two films Luke never really carries himself as a Jedi, often relying on his blaster before his saber. Yet all of a sudden in VI, from the very start of the film, Luke really feels like a Jedi. I'm just curious if it's known where Luke was during the time between movies? Either Legends or Cannon information would be cool to know. 

Thanks in advance for the assistance. Also sorry for any grammatical typos, I had to type this up fairly fast and I only had a little time for proofreading.

IMO A New Hope is greatly improved by The Prequel films.,"While I think Empire and Jedi aren't really impacted by the prequel films including Rouge One, A New Hope is the only movie where i can feel their presence.

When Owen slams Ben by calling him an old Wizard and Beru talks about how Luke is too much like his father and Owen is worried about that, you can really feel that there is some history to the universe.

With real context as seen in the prequels we know that Owen isn't keeping Luke from the Empire because he thinks he's a good farmer but because of what Luke might discover about himself.

Hearing Tarkin talk about the Emperor finally disbanding the Senate of the old republic and Vader's fight with Obi-wan, it all just feels better. Especially that Vader fight. His ""now I'm the maser line."" and seemingly high caution when fighting Obi-wan is clear because he admits he was stupid back then and the last time he saw obi-wan he lost another 3 limbs to him. So it's clear why hes kind of just prodding at him with his lightsaber.

While the prequels aren't nearly as great as the originals the value of their context is IMO.

One last thing I find kind of weird that alot of people call out with The prequels is how obi-wan jumped in age in 20 years. It should be noted that we are never told Obi-wan's or just shy of anyone's age in Star Wars.

Come to think of it, probably only the Skywalkers bloodline and clones have a confirmed age that is said or shown in the movies.

Edit: I now wonder what the complete sequel series will offer to the originals. Hopefully more then nothing.",StarWars,True,1511575009,2017-11-24

[Spoiler] Just finished Lost Stars. My thoughts...,"Just finished it. I like it, didn't love it. I didn't get the same massive adoration and love for it as ""THE BEST BOOK EVEERRR"", as I've seen around these parts.

It actually reminded me if why I'm not a YA reader. **IT'S SO SCHMALTZY**. I found myself rolling my eyes and sighing quiet a bit.

I thought it was well written though. Maybe I just have a heart of coal, but it's got me apprehensive about reading anymore star wars YA stuff if it's this saccharin.

Was also planning to read Claudia's Bloodline since she's heralded as the best star wars author in the new cannon. Maybe that one will be more towards my liking. Is it as mawkish as lost stars?",StarWars,True,1511577281,2017-11-24
[spoiler] utilizing theory about Thrawn post-Rebels,"Hopefully I am not a complete idiot and haven't missed something, but if I have spank me like the idiot I am and hit that downvote button. I accept my fate.

This is going to seem very simple and thematic, but that's on purpose. I've only got the barest notions of how this could even work, so I'll stick to basic story arc explanation.

So, evidently, according to a [SPOILER] recent Tweet, Thrawn is supposed to survive Rogue One (edit: more accurately, he survives the timeframe of Rogue One), and assuming Disney isn't simply going to dispose of him in some stupidly simple way during the OT that just...gets him out of the way and writes off his absence, is it possible that at some point he is in fact sent into the Unknown Regions; Thrawn in the original book series (I've never read them, but it's my understanding that he:) basically comes out of left field having built up a huge Empire of the Hand, having been missing for a while after he got sent on a mission.

So, what if he does in fact get sent out into the UR, and after Jakku whatever is left of the Imperial fleet meets up with his contingent, and they settle down to create...er, their own private junta I suppose--

And then we wheel back and remember that the Bendu predicted that Thrawn would lose. Who will he lose to? The crew of the Ghost? Frankly, while that's certainly possible, that strikes me as remarkably little payoff for something so pointedly said from a being that's supposedly so important (I should really watch Rebels, lol).

Meanwhile, we know that at an unspecified point Snoke assumes control over the First Order as its Supreme Leader, and if I'm not mistaken it's a fairly recent development in the timeline.

So what I'm essentially suggesting is that Thrawn's major loss is to Snoke, who popped up out of fucking nowhere in the UR, for reasons and circumstances which I hope we'll get more information on (particularly when there's a 3rd trilogy said to be in the works after this one). Perhaps the recent uptick in Imperial-themed shit might indicate the possibility that we might actually see some of this in book or game form?

Force Awakens vs Justice League,"This post probably won't gain too much interest but I saw Justice League the other night and watching the Force Awakens with my wife tonight.

First, I don't think the Force Awakens gets enough credit for introducing so many new characters and really getting to know all the characters. 

Two, my wife would never watch Justice League but we are watching Force Awakens for the 100th time.

In summary, I think JJ did a much better job on this movie than he gets credit for a lot of the time. And... I can't wait for The Last Jedi. I just hope there aren't any Rathtars.

TL;DR: Force Awakens is better than Justice League.",StarWars,True,1511578502,2017-11-24
"""The Light Side""","Anyone else bothered by the marketing's use of the phrase ""light side"" (of the Force)? In the movies, the good side is only referred to as the Force or the light; then there's the Dark Side of the Force, which is a perversion of it. The movies portray it as the Force is good/balance, and the Dark Side is evil, but the marketing makes it seem like the Force is neutral with a good and a bad side.

"Luke, Vader and Kylo discussion (POTENTIAL SPOILERS)","Rewatching the saga, just finished empire and I’m thinking back to how Obi-wan lied to Luke about Vader killing his dad. This was a pretty big deal obviously how shit goes in empire with the reveal, but anyways I’m watching the scene and Luke is just devastated, in my opinion he commits suicide, he has no idea where he’ll land or if he’ll survive he just doesn’t care. This was the most traumatic thing he’s ever been through (saying a lot considering  his aunt and uncle were brutally murdered) and while he didn’t give into the dark side like Vader had hoped, the point is he was still affected enough to lose hope. So now to Kylo (to be clear, I can’t remember specifically if this was in the force awakens novel or if this was just fan fiction/theories for how the last Jedi would play out) I remember reading that Luke, Han and Leia chose not to tell kylo about Vader being his Grandfather, I didn’t think too much about it at the time but after rewatching empire I’m thinking wtf Luke tried to kill himself when he found out about it abruptly like that, so why would he even consider putting that same kind of trauma on Kylo I mean he’s a Jedi he has enough wisdom to know he’s gonna find out some day. I also understand that even hearing that kind of news at a young age and being given the information lightly would still be rough but no comparison to him finding out on his own. It would destroy him, and most definitely fill him with fear and hate..a one way ticket to the dark side as we all know, especially when a Sith is tempting you in your dreams.

Accidental Force Lightening?,"Could a Jedi accidentally use force lightening if they were pushed too far into anger? Or possibly just an untrained force user with ""raw power"" such as Rey not knowing how to control her power.

There has definitely been some good misdirection with the trailers towards TLJ, possibly even using CGI in certain scenes to make us think something else is going on. There is that one scene that was shown in an international trailer with Rey looking pretty pissed off using the force, I wonder if she could get angry enough and ""accidentally"" use force lightening against Snoke/Kylo/guards?

"Theory: Rey will use the force to mind wipe Kylo Ren and bring him to the light, just as Revan was mind-wiped by the Jedi Council with the help of Bastilla Shan","The similarities between Rey/Kylo and Bastilla/Revan are everywhere. First just google images of both pairs. They look so much alike, especially their outfits. 

But Rey and Kylo Ren resemble Bastilla Shan and Revan in many ways beyond appearance. Rey's powers with the force seem to be unique like Bastilla's battle meditation, but instead they involve her power of Mind Control. Perhaps Rey can wipe the influence of Snoke from Kylo's mind, and bring him to the light much like Revan's story. 

Kylo was once on the light side just like Revan started out, then they both joined the dark side. It is very likely Kylo's return to the light will come to pass in a similar manner to Revan's. Bastilla helped capture Revan, but I believe Rey will actually perform the mind wipe or bring him to the light just as Luke brought Vader to the light. This is something Luke can help teach her, and it's easy to envision the scene in which Luke convince's Rey of the possibility to convert Kylo. I also anticipate Rey will use a similar strategy and get captured to let Kylo/Snokes guard down, as both Luke and Bastilla were captured as well.

 Disney combining the stories of the original trilogy with KOTOR would be a brilliant way to connect with so many viewers. And both stories are already proven to be well liked by the public.

Leia: Princess of Alderaan,"So after finishing Bloodline, I decided to pick up Leia: Princess of Alderaan and I loved it! Claudia Gray is seriously killing it with her characterization of Leia and I really hope she's able to write more books in the Star Wars universe. 

I loved reading about Leia's time as a princess of Alderaan and the interaction between her parents. It was especially heartbreaking at times knowing what would happen to them in the future. 

The new characters that stood out the most were Amilyn Holdo and Kier Domadi. I'll admit I had a hard time liking Kier at first. Liking any love interest toward Leia other than Han Solo felt like cheating! But I really started to like him after awhile. I knew of course they would have to get rid of him somehow, but I certainly didn't expect that ending. It's sad to know that Leia has now lost two loves her life. (Kier, and now Han) 

Seeing classic OT characters show up in the novel was awesome as well. Mon Mothma's character was spot on, and each chapter with Tarkin was tense and suspenseful. 

Anyway, I seriously recommend this book to those who haven't read it. I haven't seen a post about this book yet so I'd love to discuss it with those who have finished it as well! ",StarWars,True,1511627579,2017-11-25

"What is your theory about what the finale of ""The Last Jedi"" will be (*Spoiler*)?","Based on the footage I found as well as discussions, I suspect Rey and Kylo will become temporary allies.

As Snoke tortures Rey, images comes to Rey's mind about her parents who were killed by Snoke, and it releases Rey's full power. She fights back and destroys not only Snoke but his lair. As flames fall to the ground, leaving Rey and Kylo as the sole survivors, Kylo extends his hand to Rey however Rey realizes Kylo wants Rey by his side more to do with his greed for power as opposed to Kylo returning to the light and she rejects it.

Kylo is obviously the student, as he’s beaten by Rey who had absolutely no training whatsoever. Thus, Kylo must have a master. At the end of TFA, Snoke tells Hux to get Kylo Ren to “finish his training.” (not exact quote, don’t hate) Soooooo who would be at the head of a Sith apprentice’s training? A Sith Lord. Who’s at the head of Kylo’s training? Snoke. Put two and two together: Snoke is a Sith Lord.

If it took them 10 years to produce lets say 1,500,000 clones on Kamino, how did the republic amass an army of 600,000,000 in such a short period of time.

Why won't they put Lando in the new movies?,"I remember a lot of people being disappointed when it was announced that [Lando Calrissian wouldn't appear in The Force Awakens](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/star-wars-force-awakens-won-lando-calrissian-article-1.2228113), but I also remember thinking to myself, ""That's okay, they're probably holding off until Episode VIII to bring him back because that's more like poetry, it rhymes."" [But I guess they're not doing that either.](http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/21/star-wars-the-last-jedi-lando-calrissian/)

I've seen a lot of people responding to this by praising Lucasfilm for putting story above fanservice and not shoving Lando into a film where he has nothing to do. Because Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb played such a crucial role in TFA and Rogue One just wouldn't have been the same without Artoo, Threepio, and the cantina thugs, right? 

But more than that, no one handed Rian Johnson a script and said, ""You have to film this and cannot deviate it from it in any way."" If they wanted Lando to be in the movie, they could have written a role for him in the movie, even if it was just a glorified cameo. C-3PO did fuckall in TFA but he had to be in there because it's Star Wars so they put him in. Presumably TLJ will feature characters dealing with the aftermath of Han's death; they couldn't even squeeze Lando in for that?

Billy Dee Williams isn't getting any younger, kids. He's been saying for years that he'd love to come back and play Lando if they'd ask him, so why won't they ask him? What's the holdup?

Prequel Trilogy - Story vs. Aesthetics vs. Acting (long post),"I really don’t have any justification for writing this other than I’m itching to talk about Star Wars in anticipation for Episode VIII, but I want to talk about the prequel films and discuss some of the various strengths and weaknesses that each of the three films had. Now: I’m a prequel sympathizer, but I’m not a prequel apologist. I struggle to call them good films as even at their best they only just teeter the line of competency. They have their strong moments and scenes in them, but so much of what makes them up is just an absolute mess. However, there are things about each film and the trilogy as whole (along with their canon secondary material) that make me appreciate them and feel that they’re at least worth checking out for one viewing if nothing else. For the purposes of this post, I’m going to be comparing the story, aesthetic (including visual effects and overall filmmaking style), and acting within each of the three films and across the board as a whole.

Story:

I don’t mind the overarching plot of the prequels. I think the way that Chancellor Palpatine masterminded the fall of the republic is in many ways one of the most interesting things about the prequels. I love how the Clone Wars comes together and I find that the strongest material for the prequels hinges around this conflict and the stories and experiences that come from it. If you haven’t guessed by now I’m a massive fan of the Clone Wars TV, and I think it’s by far the strongest thing to have come out of the prequels. The movies on the other hand falter in terms of writing.

As grating as this is going to sound, I think Episode I probably has the most concise and coherent narrative out of the prequel trilogy. Sure there’s little head scratchers here and there like an elected monarchy that’s never explained, but I can explain the events of Episode I in a concise statement: “Queen Amidala of the planet Naboo is forced into a dire situation when a militarized trade union blockades and then invades her planet, subjugating her people. Seeking to free her planet, she flees Naboo to plead for support in the intergalactic senate with the aid of two Jedi escorts and a young force sensitive whom she meets along the way. When her case is dismissed by the senate, Queen Amidala decides to forgo diplomacy and returns to Naboo to free her planet by the force of conflict if necessary.” You can decry that the events are boring in Episode I or that they’re relatively unimportant in the scale of the whole trilogy (or saga), but there is a sense of cause and effect here that is missing in the subsequent films.

Attack of the Clones spends half its story with charming Obi-wan Kenobi as he goes on a whodunit mystery quest to find out who’s behind the attack on Senator Padme Amidala and eventually who is behind the creation of the clone army. The other half is spent with our none-so-charming Jedi padawan Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala as they “fall in love”. Kenobi’s story is by far the more interesting of the two for several reasons, one being he’s a charismatic actor (but we’ll come back to that later) with other being that Kenobi’s adventure hold’s a sense of weight to the immediate story at hand. Anakin and Padme’s story is hard to watch (acting aside) because their story contributes almost nothing to the plot outside of each other’s character growth. This would be fine if Anakin and Padme were interesting characters, but Padme changes hardly at all until she declares her love for Anakin at the arena and Anakin just becomes increasingly uncomfortable to watch as the plot drags along (once again, an issue of acting). The love story just isn’t fun and by the time the two plots intersect when Anakin and Padme go to rescue Obi-wan most of the audience has probably just fallen fatigued by their half of the story.

Revenge of the Sith has a rather compelling story up until the halfway point when the entire cause and effect structure of the narrative crumbles apart during the confrontation with the chancellor. Aside from the fact Anakin’s transition to the dark side is rushed as hell, his transformation is given two justifications and one of them makes no sense. His first reason for turning is his faith that Palpatine’s teachings could save Padme, which is fine I suppose if not a bit forced. His second reason- believing the Jedi have betrayed the republic, comes out of nowhere and makes no sense… He knows Palpatine is a sith and he knows that Palpatine has orchestrated the Clone Wars; he has no reason to believe the Jedi have betrayed the republic aside from the idea that the plot says so. Even with the context of the Clone Wars TV series in which the Jedi Order is portrayed as becoming overly militarized and a shadow of its former moral standing, it’s presented that as flawed as they are the Jedi have only ever had the republic’s best interests at heart. Anakin’s second motivation for turning to Palpatine makes no sense knowing what we know that Anakin knows about the Jedi. I can see Anakin betraying the Jedi out of resentment for the way they’ve treated him (in addition to how they’ve treated his padawan Ahsoka and in general how they’ve lost their moral code), but for him to just suddenly exclaim “I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over!” is a bit of a leap in logic I can’t overlook.

So in summary, I don’t mind the overall plot that trilogy was going for, but it could’ve been tweaked a bit to be more interesting and coherent.

Aesthetic:

The prequel trilogy abuses CGI. All three films do; there’s no question about that. However, I think Episode I comes the closest to having a great style. I think that if The Phantom Menace was made today, the CGI would have been a bit more balanced and the film’s digital effects and characters would look fine onscreen. The thing I admire most about Episode I is that the locations in the film are a lot of the time real physical places. There are actual sets for the throne rooms and meeting rooms in Coruscant and Naboo. They actually went and shot on location in Tunisia and Italy for Tatooine and Naboo respectively and it shows. Sure, a lot of the matte painting techniques they used for backgrounds in the original trilogy have been eschewed in favor of digitally created backgrounds which at times do look a bit out of place of dated and the CGI characters like the battle droids and Jar-Jar don’t hold up all that well, but I give this film credit for actually building sets and shooting on location when they really didn’t have to.

On the other hand, very little feels real in Attack of the Clones or Revenge of the Sith. The Jedi Temple never feels like a real place, Coruscant never feels like a real place, Geonosis never feels like a real place, Kamino never feels like a real place… All of these locations are almost entirely green screened from the floors, the rooms they’re in, to the aliens that inhabit them, to the landscapes on the planets. It’s just never convincing and it’s clear that the actors are struggling to act when they’re standing a completely green room and talking to people that aren’t there. The only places in these two films that don’t appear to be digitally created at the homestead on Tatooine, a few rooms on Coruscant, and maybe one or two other small environments. Revenge of the Sith gets off a bit better as the environments, while not totally real looking, are still more interesting to look at and a bit better graphically. I honestly feel like I’m looking at an old PlayStation game half the time in Episode II.

Even little touches that didn’t need to be CGI in the final films are made digital. The entire clone army is digital. Even many of the clones who appear in close up sequences are created digitally and it’s jarring when they’re put next to real actors. They could’ve put people in suits for the role, and I don’t know why they didn’t. These films really suffered from the abundance of CGI, especially the final two.

Acting (and Screenplay):

George Lucas is not a good dialogue writer and he’s not a good director of actors. He seems to command his actors to put on monotone voices and bizarre accents, perhaps for a more exotic sound, but it just comes off as making already clumsily written dialogue be delivered with awful cadences and nowhere is this more apparent than Episode I. People often rag on Episode I for being the worst of the three (though in my personal opinion I’d put Episode II as the worst) and I will say the acting in that film is extraordinarily poor and I’m sure part of why people often place it as their worst. The poor actors in this film are just stumbling through their lines with a consistently flat performance and not a hint of inflection or emotion and it just gives the whole film this stilted and dull feel to it. The only two actors who I feel manage to make it through with some semblance of an interesting performance are Liam Neeson as Qui-Gonn and Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, both of whom have their moments where they manage to actually make me feel a little bit for each of their characters.

Where Episode I has the problem of just having dull and uninteresting performances, Episode II has the opposite problem of ricocheting between good and extraordinarily terrible performances. Ewan McGregor finally settles into his role in this film and his performance as Obi-wan is absolutely a joy to watch. On the other hand we have Hayden Christianson and Natalie Portman who have absolutely no chemistry together as Anakin and Padme. Padme manages to come as boring but relatively harmless in her performance, whereas Anakin actually makes me uncomfortable to watch in the film whenever he’s around Padme. I don’t know if it was the direction of George or an acting choice of Christianson, but he comes off as a creepy stalker and his dialogue just gives you the vibes that at any moment he’ll snap and hurt Padme. If it was supposed to be foreshadowing that Anakin was going to turn then it’s an absolute hindrance to the story because its makes the angle of Anakin’s fall being tragic and the notion Padme would fall in love with the openly deranged teenager seem like absolute nonsense. The performances of the lovers in this film is one of the key reasons why I rank it the lowest of the three.

Episode III has by far the strongest performances of its cast. Ewan is still on top of things as Obi-wan and even though Hayden and Natalie still have no chemistry, they’re not unbearable to watch anymore when they’re on screen together. I have to say a lot of the performances from Hayden and Ewan really do work in this film. I can feel the tension and the conflict inside Anakin regarding his future in this film (even if the writing isn’t always there to support it) just from subtle facial acting and I can feel the regret and sense of loss from Obi-wan in this film. Even Natalie turns in an okay performance even though her character has very little to do in the film. I feel that this is the point where George finally allowed his actors to explore their characters. There’s even several moments in the film that eschew dialogue entirely in favor of quiet contemplative character moments accompanied by score which I find really work. Overall, Episode III is definitely the best acting wise.

Lightsaber Fights:

(Because I want to talk about them, so whatever…)

Episode I’s fight between Darth Maul and Obi-wan and Qui-Gonn is still one of my top fights of the whole saga. Sure it has no stakes, but it’s just so energetic and well-choreographed and just overall fun to watch. It actually created some tension for the boring end climax that otherwise doesn’t have the same level or stakes or investment.

Episode II’s fights between Count Dooku and Obi-wan and Anakin, as well as Count Dooku and Yoda weren’t fun to watch all. The choreography was slow and ridiculous to watch. The close-ups made it hard to tell what was going on half the time and I didn’t get the sense that Dooku was competent, I got the sense that Anakin and Obi-wan sucked. The fight really starts to get ridiculous when Anakin gets the second light saber and then just starts twirling around like a moron. Then the two just start spinning their sabers over their heads in close-up and it’s just the stupidest looking thing I’ve ever seen. Yoda’s fight is even more ridiculous as his flipping around just looks dumb and his tiny saber never looks like it’s even aiming for Dooku.

The fights in Revenge of the Sith range from ridiculous to good. I liked the fight on Mustafar and felt there was a good sense of weight and conflict even if the choreography and stunts got a bit out of hand at times. Grevious and Obi-wan’s battle is sort of ridiculous, but it’s fun to watch for me so I give it a bit of a pass. I don’t like the beginning of Dooku and Obi-wan and Anakin’s fight as it’s far too slow and not choreographed all that well, but it picks up and becomes a bit better after Obi-wan gets knocked out and Anakin and Count Dooku duel solo. The fight between Yoda and Palpatine is still ridiculous though for the same reason that the fight between Yoda and Count Dooku was.

Conclusions:

There are many other facets to these films I could go into detail about, but I feel like they’re largely the same across the board. The dialogue writing is terrible all around, the score is fantastic even when the films aren’t (thank god for John Williams), the films employ racist stereotypes for Jar-Jar/the Trade Federation, etc.…

I could ramble for days about these films and the good and the bad they’ve done for Star Wars as a whole, but what I really wanted to do was compare the individual strengths and weaknesses of these films against each other. So how do I rank the prequel trilogy?

Well, I put all three films below the original trilogy without a doubt and Episode II is definitely my least favorite, but I don’t have a definitive answer for whether or not I like Episode I or Episode III better. I really appreciate the Phantom Menace for at least making use of practical sets and location and for having a concise story with proper cause and effect. On the other hand, Episode III is definitely the better acted and directed film even if its story and aesthetic style suffered in the process. I don’t know if I can really answer anything definitively.

Well I can say I’m excited for Episode VIII!",StarWars,True,1511674524,2017-11-26

[Theory] The Emperor's power of Vader,"As we all know, once Anakin becomes Darth Vader, The Emperor wields complete control over him. Up until now I, as I’m sure many of you, assumed this was because Palpatine successfully seduced Anakin with the sheer power of the Dark Side. After rewatching the saga however (in particular episodes III &amp; VI) I realised that, while the power of the Dark Side is instrumental in converting Anakin, it actually is more complicated than that.

Here is my theory: It starts in [this famous scene](https://imgur.com/jMHPvx6.jpeg8) in *Revenge of The Sith*, where Palpatine tells Anakin of the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise, specifically the dark ability to prevent loved ones from dying, playing perfectly in Anakin's inability to let go of anyone he fears to lose as Yoda puts it. It is almost certain that Palpatine caused Anakin to have visions of Padmés death in order to force Anakin to come over to the dark side so he can save her, especially as we know Anakin told Palpatine of what he did to the sand people when his mother died and thus Palpatine was able to exploit Anakin's one weakness; his love for his wife. As Palpatine has no intention of really allowing Padmé to survive, this promise of the power to save her might just have been lie to seduce Anakin. However, evidence suggests otherwise.

Now skip ahead to after Vader is defeated by Obi Wan after their dual on Mustafaar. This is the most critical scene of the entire theory. Vader is defeated, mortally wounded and extremely close to death when The Emperor finds him. Palpatine sends for medical help, then when the clones have gone he [leans over Anakin and stretches a hand over his face and gently touches his face, before recoiling](https://imgur.com/Ej7IuXC.jpeg). I submit that this is when The Emperor uses the dark power discussed earlier on Anakin, preventing him from dying from his horrific injuries. From this point onwards, for the rest of his life, all that is keeping Anakin alive is the power of the Emperor, and he knows it.

Now we jump ahead to *Return of The Jedi*. [In this scene when Luke is captured by the Imperials he has a moment alone with Vader](https://imgur.com/graX5kM.jpeg). Luke appeals to Vader to come back to the light. Vader pauses, then tells Luke
“You don’t know the power of the Dark Side, I *must* obey my master.” What Vader is in fact saying is he has no choice but to obey The Emperor, regardless of what he wants to do, because the power of the Dark Side is all that is protecting him from death. Once Luke is taken away Vader pauses, showing for the first time a moment of hesitation that coming face to face with his son brings. The fact the Luke is alive is proof that Palpatine lied to him, Padme must have survived his attack on her in his rage on Mustafaar, at least long enough to give birth to Luke. However, Vader knows he has no choice but to be the puppet of The Emperor, or face his own destruction. Later, as The Emperor is torturing Luke to death, Vader makes his decision at last and kills Palpatine in order to save his son, sacraficing his own life for Lukes. Once the Emperor is dead, his power to keep Anakin alive is removed, and Anakin is once again on the verge of death as he had been after being defeated by Kenobi on Mustafaar.

A few notes on Vader's death. We know Luke has just beaten Vader in his final dual, although Luke only destroys one of Vader's robot hands. We know individuals can survive perfectly well with damaged robot appendages, as we see [Vader without any of his replacements limbs](https://imgur.com/zHlnLe7.gif) in *Rogue One*, and we see [Luke's robot hand take damage aboard Jabbas barge on Tatooine](https://imgur.com/Yq3uwmn.gif). Let's not also forget [Anakin loses and entire arm in *Attack of The Clones*](https://imgur.com/lTBAFu9.jpeg), so losing a mechanical hand barely constitutes an injury for him at all, evidenced by the fact he immediately gets to his feet and stands with The Emperor. 

We also know the force lightning is something that a strong individual can endure, sometimes for great lengths of time, without killing them. Luke had just endured repeated, vicious doses of force lightning, apparently without any lasting harm, as had The Emperor himself in *Revenge of the Sith*, and let's not forget [Anakin himself got a blasting of force lightning in *Attack of the Clones*](https://i.imgur.com/shawTMi.gif) and was able to get up and carry one the dual with Dooku not long after! So it is safe to assume that [The Emperors final blast of lightning taken by Vader](https://imgur.com/DtsmxbP.gif), though temporarily debilitating, would by no means have been enough to kill him.

Some may argue Vaders suit itself is what kept him alive, as opposed to The Emperors power. This can be demonstrated as untrue due to the many times Vader suit is damaged or times he is not wearing it at all (as in *Rogue One*), however remember Vader is still fully suited when he throws the Emperor to his death.

To summarise: when The Emperor tells Anakin he knows of a power to prevent death itself he is not merely attempting to seduce Anakin to the Dark Side, he really is aware of this power and in fact possesses it (which strongly implies that he, as Darth Sidious, was in fact the apprentice of Darth Plagueis). He does not give the secret up straight away however in order to further seduce Anakin to the Dark Side and as he has no intention of saving Padme’s life. When Palpatine find Darth Vader defeated and close to death in Mustafaar he kneels over him, and uses the dark power to save Vader’s life. Ever since then the only thing keeping Vader alive has been The Emperor’s power, and Vader is well aware of that fact, and hints at it several times. As he watches The Emperor torturing his son to death he makes a choice to save Luke’s life by killing The Emperor, and thereby sacrificing himself as well. This is why, though relatively unharmed after Luke defeats him, having only lost a mechanical hand and suffered a comparatively brief attach of force lightning, once The Emperor is killed Vader is once again on the verge of Death, as weak as he was before The Emperor’s power was granted him after his defeat by Kenobi, all those years before. So after all Kenobi did kill Vader, but his death was unnaturally postponed by The Emperor, until Vader chose to die in order to save his son.",StarWars,True,1511676513,2017-11-26
