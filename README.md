# Web-APIs-Classification
Project 3 Reddit

Description

In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Now we're going to put those skills to the test.

For project 3, your goal is two-fold:

Using Reddit's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.

You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.

What is Reddit?


is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website
Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images,
which are then voted up or down by other members.
Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called "subreddits", 
which cover a variety of topics including news, science, movies, video games, etc.
As of February 2018, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors
Ranked as the #3 most visited website in U.S.
Reddit was founded by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman.
