[Spoilers] Jon won’t take the Iron Throne while Daenerys lives,"Specific to the show, Jon’s character development gets overlooked I think, because he is a standard good lookin’ good guy. Thing is, he was murdered for doing the right thing, and as you might expect that shook him to his core. I think Kit Harrington did a fine job of portraying that uncertainty following his resurrection. The last few episodes of season 7 demonstrated Jon finding his footing again, by identifying himself repeatedly as his father’s son. His real father, Ned Stark. He declared his allegiance to his father’s values and worldview in the dragon pit and again when telling Theon to man up and save his sister.

Jon will not take the throne while Daenerys lives. He bent the knee and declared it to everyone. Finding out that he is the legal heir to the throne will make no difference to him.: “When enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything. Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies”. ",gameofthrones,True,1535657064,2018-08-30

Question:  do you think the Night King could have flown Viserion over the Wall or did he need to destroy it before he could cross it?  

&amp;#x200B;

The novels talk more about the magics woven into the Wall, but that gets little but lip service in the show.  But, largely, I wonder if the Night King could have just flown over the Wall and attacked The Seven Kingdoms with only Viserion.",gameofthrones,True,1535662080,2018-08-30

[SPOILERS] Question about Cersei's prophecy.,"So the prophecy that the Witch told to Cersei was that she would have three children that would eventually die.

Everyone's pointed out the whole ""first child"" thing where she had a young child before Joffrey that had died. But now that she's ""pregnant"", that would make a total of five children.

Ignoring the theories that she's not actually pregnant, I had a question about the prophecy.

So, the witch says to Cersei, of her three children, ""Gold will be their crowns, gold their shroud"". So she specifically described that these three children would be ""royal"" children or whatever. So she could still have had the first born child who died too young to be considered ""royal"" and have another child who suffers the same fate, right?

I'm just wondering if I'm misunderstanding the prophecy, since I've seen people saying that the show contradicts the prophecy with these two extra children.",gameofthrones,True,1535674201,2018-08-30

-have grown out of their princess-dreams phase and became acquainted with harsh reality.

-had royal families that were removed from their castles.

-were abused/harmed by numerous men in power (Joff, Ramsay, Littlefinger / Hans, Duke of Weselton).

-became stronger and more strategic people in their exiles.

-reunite with exiled members of their families (Jon / Anna).

-retook their homelands with the help of family and special talents (Sansa manipulated Littlefinger to get Arryn men to fight in the Battle of the Bastards / ice and love powers?)

-restored their lands to their formal glories.

-have become the de facto monarchs of their lands.

Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you’ve seen before.”

Is it possible that what Little finger is describing is actually green sight?

Is the reason he smiles as she walks away because he got in her head, or because he knew Bran was about to make his astonishing homecoming?

The ability to envision every foreseeable outcome and every series of events all at once sounds a lot like green sight.

Could this explain how such a spineless man could have the audacity and courage to incite the War of the Five Kings?

We've seen a man with no land, no wealth, and no armies somehow came into all of them. If it's true, then how can we be sure he is truly dead? He wouldn't be the first person to return from the dead.

[Spoilers] Why is HBO rushing the story?,"This is the choice that boggles me the most.  Why is HBO making the last two seasons so short if they are just going to rush the story?  The only reason I can think of to shorten the seasons is if they’ve no more story to tell but that clearly isn’t the case.  They could’ve planned a remotely feasible way for the Night King to acquire a dragon if they didn’t try to do it all within one episode which ended being absolute garbage.

It seems like all of the missteps that were made was due to being too constrained by screen time and not having enough time to plant seeds, develop the plot and let it breathe a bit.  I think even the most amateurish writers could’ve figured out ways to fill up the gaps and despite some of the terrible choices the writers have made I know that they are at least talented enough to pull that off. 

I can’t think of any single reason to shorten the seasons and I think GOT has only suffered for it. 100% mistake with zero benefit.",gameofthrones,True,1535817100,2018-09-01

[SPOILERS] speculative plot outline for season 8 episode 2,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1535822911,2018-09-01
[SPOILERS] One simple fix that would've fixed the winterfell plotline last season,"There are a lot of things people didnt like about season 7, I personally thought the season was average at best but I did have my problems with it, one of them was the way they handled the winterfell plotline. Now there were a lot of problems i had with that storyline and while I can think of many ways for it to be fixed I think there is one way they could've fixed it, tell the plotline from both sisters perspectives.

In the plotline we got we only really got the plotline from one of sisters, that sister being sansa and not only did it alienated Arya fans and made them feel like the showrunners only cared about Sansa these days but also it may arya look like she was acting WAY out of line, even out of character in some parts.

And yes I do think she was testing sansa and maybe that is what the showrunners were trying to go for, from the commentary it may it seem like it was meant to be rewatched a second time around to understand rhe subtle clues or maybe you were always suppose to suspect that arya was testing sansa and there was no real reason to give it a full reveal. But to be honest would you really notice either way? Because first of all the average viewer shouldn't have to watch it a second time around to see the subtle clues and secondly they removed the deleted scene with bran where this would get revealed along with them making up so there no point in keeping it subtle or having it be the case if your going to delete a very important scene (unless they reveal it next season).

So believe they should've had the plotline told from both arya and sansa's perspective. You can still have the scenes with Sansa in the story we got but also have some scenes with arya, maybe have some scenes where she does some more FM style sleuthing, maybe have a scene where she talks to bran or herself about what she's been through and how she fears sansa may have forgotten she is a stark and may be going astray, and if she is testing Sansa maybe even explain to bran that it is the only way she can know if sansa is telling the truth or not. Also maybe have some scene where she's bonding with  lyanna mormont and maybe those two guards (and not just make it seem like arya is straight up anti-social). So that way when Arya and Sansa to get into conflict Arya doesn't just look like a psycho but instead you would understand from both characters why they are acting the they are acting and your opinions on which one you agree with can change through out.

Now this wouldnt fix the plotline entirely for example you would still need the scene where bran tells sansa of LF betrayal on Ned. But either way I think telling the storyline from both sisters perspectives may have improved the season.",gameofthrones,True,1535823233,2018-09-01

Some people say it was an act to throw off Littlefinger but they were still acting bizarre to each other behind closed doors. The scene with Sansa finding the masks made me cringe because it was so contrary to their characters (IMHO).

[SPOILERS] Any ending to GOT will be disappointing,"The show has built its own stereotype of not doing the stereotype. That makes it so killing any character at this point in the story is unsurprising and arguably just to try and make it more interesting.

That leaves Westeros surviving. But who leads?
All main characters die - expected

[Spoilers] The Future Hand of the King will be...,"Jaime Lannister. Rewatching the show a few times it got my attention that in season 1 they made several little comments foreshadowing Jaime's ending game as Hand of the King.


* **S1E1** in his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days. Remember Jaime always uses jokes to deflect insecurance or frustration. I actually think he likes the idea.


* **S1E1** When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. ""The Starks are feasting on this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people""

That already got my attention. I expect the Jon and the Starks to rule the kingdom in the end and a new time, a time for wolves to start in Westeros by the end of this story, and I think Jaime will be the last Lannister left to restore his House.

* **S1E2** Later we see Jaime going to Jon Snow to thank him for joining the NW, he offers his right hand and makes a joke about Jon's decision. They even make sure to focus on the hand shake.

* **S1E3** When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King ""how do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it?

Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.


* **S1E5** - in the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.

* **S1E5** Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!

How many times now did they mention Jaime and the Hand of the King job? how did I miss this in my first views of the show? I was actually shocked. I think the show was giving us some hints about the end right in season 1.

* **S1E7** - Tywin is introduced in that awesome scene with the dead stag and in that scene he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. Jaime now in season 7 is finally taking back his life and becoming the hero we all expect him to be.

______________

**BOOK FORESHADOW**

And I would like to add that in the books it is not a pin, but a chain of hands that signifies the office of the hand.And the mummers make a rope and hang Jaime’s hand around his neck like a chain.

&gt;Bolton’s silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoat’s slobbering malevolence. Pale as morning mist, his eyes concealed more than they told. Jaime misliked those eyes. They reminded him of the day at King’s Landing when Ned Stark had found him seated on the Iron Throne. The Lord of the Dreadfort finally pursed his lips and said, **“You have lost a hand.”**             
     
&gt;**""No**,“ said Jaime, **“I have it here, hanging round my neck.”** 

(ASOS, Jaime IV)

&gt;Ned, **he should have kissed the hand that slew Aerys**, but he preferred to scorn the arse he found sitting on Robert’s throne ––

* **On season 5** -  Jaime decides to go to Dorne to rescue Myrcella, when Bronn asks him why go alone and not bring an army with him, he answer is **""I didnt want to start another war.""** He is able to convince Doran to let Myrcella go back to Kings Landing without start another conflict. (Of Course Ellaria Sand puts a ugly end to this agreement)

________________________

* **On season 6** - Jaime is sent to Riverlands to take back the Tullys castle from the Balckfish and once again he is able to solve the conflict without bloodshed. 

_________________________________




Jaime Lannister, unlike his younger brother, is humble man, he pays attention to his mistakes and tries to learn from it and not repeat them.  He will be an ambassador, a peacemaker, the new Hand of the King. Jon Snow has no experience in the south; he doesnt know the Houses or the High Lords, but Jaime Lannister lived his whole life in Kings Landing, he watched his father his whole life. He would Jon Snow right hand during his rulling period.

The ending of Game of Thrones (creative writing)," 

“I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains. A sentence used too many times to describe my status in this world. As far as I can remember I was told that I was meant to rule Westeros, to be Queen over the land due to my Targaryen blood, the blood of the Dragon Kings. I couldn’t have been more wrong.” 

I looked out the window, where the sea churned and the storm raged. It was brutally cold, to the point where the fire in the fireplace was struggling to stay strong, to stay warm, to stay vibrant. I smirked at the irony, due to the fact that the fire was me in a way. Slowly dying inside. My dragons have been uneasy lately. I could see, beyond the mist, Drogon and Rhaegal in flight, playing with each other, while also trying to find food, flames flying through the night sky. I suddenly got dizzy and quickly sat on the chair close to the fire. 7 months pregnant, and every moment of the pregnancy has been painful and nerve wracking. I haven’t even been able to fly my dragons into battle because of my immobility. 

“Your Grace, may I come in. I would like to ponder some words with you.” said Tyrion

“Come in Tyrion. I'm tired of being on this dreadful island while everyone else is at war. Where are the Queens Guard?” said Daenerys

“They’re positioned at the gates Your Grace. They will stay there until the war is finished. If, God forbid, the Night King lands on Dragonstone, your dragons will be the last line of defence.” said Tyrion 

“I was born on this island. Not that I remember it of course. I was too young. I had to flee alongside my brother to another land to escape the usurper Robert and his assassins after they took my families throne. Now another usurper sits on the throne, your sister, his wife Cersei Lannister. I am in a bad position but I assure you, if the Night King comes I will lay fire down on him like never before. I will not flee. I will not run. I promise you that.” said Daenerys

“Dragonstone Island was once the most irrelevant, miniscule place in the realm, just an island with no produce, and fewer people. But then your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror and his two sisters Visenya and Rhaenys Targaryen, alongside their three dragons conquered seven kingdoms and millions of subjects in a few months, acceded the Iron Throne, and his ancestors, the Dragon Kings ruled for hundreds of years. Now you’re in the same situation, now you’re back at that island, back in the same castle with no Iron Throne to sit on, and a Kingdom you say is yours by right of succession. You’re a conqueror Daenerys, and you will rule, but we must be patient and wait for this threat to be extinguished.” Tyrion said

“I will not wait, I will not ponder. I am Daenerys Targaryen of the Old Blood of Valyria. I am the dragon. I will not rest until I leave this forsaken island with my dragons and kill the Night King. There is nothing but cold and sorrow on this island, and even more in this castle. My lover, Jon Snow, is off fighting a battle, alongside his siblings, and his subjects. The rest of the kingdom is in motion to stop the dead who march on my Kingdom.” yelled Daenerys

“I would like to remind you that you once had three dragons. Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. As your hand and advisor I warned you not to fly beyond the wall to protect Jon Snow from the Night King. You did not take my advice. You left with three dragons, and arrived with two. We must be smart. You are in full labor. You are Azor Ahai, You are the chosen one to rid us off the evil that marches on your Kingdom, but all good things come in good time.”

As Tyrion was talking a loud shriek came from outside the balcony of the Chamber of the Painted Table. The dragons were uneasy just as their mother was. It was brutally cold and the seas were rising. The storms smashing up against Dragonstone Castle. At that moment Varys the Spider, one of Queen Daenerys advisors and spies came in.

“Your Grace. We have just received word from Jon Snow, the King in the North. His little brother, Brandon Stark has a solution that involves you and has seen that you are to save us from the threat marching on the kingdom. The details I do not know but Jon Snow has asked you and your garrison northeast, to The Vale to have an audience with him. He is your husband, your grace, and your protection, as well as the babies is paramount, and so has asked you to travel by land to protect yourself and the baby.” Varys said

Daenerys sat at the head chair, and looked over the painted table, which was in the shape of Westeros. She ran her fingers along the table and thought and pondered on their circumstance.

“Why The Vale. Last time I heard from him he was in his castle at WInterfell, ruling over the North. What happened?” Daenerys asked

“Your grace. The Night King and the dead have overrun the North and has dominion over it all. He will be marching into the Riverlands soon enough, which is why it would be dangerous to travel by boat. We must be cautious.” Varys said 

“Prepare my ships. Prepare my guards. They will stay here at Dragonstone in case of my return. You both will find me at The Vale” Daenerys said.

Daenerys then walked out of the chamber, walked through the dragonglass halls, to the royal apartments and sat on the bench in the front of her bed. She looked into the flames of the fireplace and immediately knew what she needed to do.

“Missandei come and help me”

Missandei came in breathless with Varys and Tyrion behind her.

“I’m here your grace. How can I serve you?” Missandei asked

“Help me put my riding boots on, and braid my hair. I can’t have it blowing in my face while I fly.” Daenerys said

“You cannot fly Your Grace. You are too far into your pregnancy and it could be a strain  on you and your baby.” Tyrion said 

“ I can’t be worried about a strain. The baby will be fine. I have a duty to this kingdom. I have a duty to my people. I have a duty to the throne.” Daenerys said

Daenerys got up and walked out of the royal apartments, past the Chamber of the Painted Table, through the throne room, and out the main doors. Her guards tried to follow her.

“Gaomagon daor nyesha nyke” Daenerys said *“Do not approach me”*

They stopped in their tracks and returned to their positions. 

Daenerys then walked down the steps and through the main gates. The wind swept her dress up and the rain smashed against her face but she kept walking, the next foot surer than the last. She walked through the beach of the island.

“Drogon, Rhaegal, māzigon naejot issa. Naejot aōha muñnykeā” Daenerys said *“Come to me, come to your mother.”*

Drogon and Rhaegal flew over the ocean and landed in front of their mother. Tyrion and Missandei ran on to the beach and hugged Daenerys. 

“Stay safe Daenerys. You are our last hope.” Tyrion said 

You’re my greatest friend. You are meant to rule this kingdom. I will see that day come.” Missandei said

“I love you both. I’ll be back. Don’t worry about me. I am the blood of Old Valyria. I am the Dragon.” Daenerys said

Daenerys climbed onto Drogon and flew away, with Rhaegal following behind her. Daenerys pushed Drogon to break the through the clouds so she could not be seen and flew Drogon as fast as she could. The cold at that altitude was brutal, and the wind nearly blew her away but she kept steady. The Vale is a mountain region ruled by The Arryns, one that is very high up in the mountains and impregnable. *That's probably why Jon escaped there with his household* Daenerys thought. 

Drogon began to shriek, beckoning to his brother Rhaegal to descend as they neared the Vale. As Daenerys got low enough she saw more fires ablaze than ever before, and men scrambling to build up defenses and make weapons. Daenerys saw mothers and children trying hard to stay warm as the Nights Kings jurisdiction and influence grew stronger and stronger, marching closer and closer. Daenerys landed in the gardens of The Eyrie and briskly got off.

Guards came, spears up, surrounding Daenerys, moving in closer

“Who are you and why are you here?” the guard questioned

“No need to be so crude. I am Daenerys of the House Targaryen. I am the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Your Lord, Jon Snow, is my husband, and I carry his child.” Daenerys answered

The guards disarmed themselves and bent their knees. They then returned to their positions and lit more fires, hoping to stay warm. Daenerys walked into The Eyrie, and descended deep into the palace to find the throne room. When she reached the heavy Iron doors, she saw her husband at the end of the hallway, with his guards, military advisors, and his brother Brandon, his two sister Arya and Sansa, and his close friends, Samwell Tarly, Tormund Giantsbane, Ser Jorah, Ser Davos, and as she began to walk down the steps the room got dark and the floor began to spun and……

“Dany, Dany please wake up” 

As Daenerys began to stir, she saw Jon sitting at the end of the bed, and the Maester making a potion at the corner of the room. The room was incredibly hot, and it was clearly sunrise by the look of it. Dany got up and Jon ran to her. He hugged her and kissed her, cried on her, and began to laugh.

“I missed you so much. Are you okay, do you feel alright?” Jon asked 

“I’m alright my love. Just a bit sore and tired, It’s been too long and I couldn’t bear myself on that cold dreary island. I needed to see, and my dragons were restless, and I want to fight. I want to kill that monster, and the baby….” Daenerys froze 

“Where is my baby”?

“You mean our boy? He’s in the nursery. Everyone is with him. We made a beautiful baby Dany. You did it. You’re the strongest woman I know.” Jon replied

“How long has it been?” Daenerys asked 

“Only a fortnight, but the Night King is coming. You must return back to Dragonstone where you can be kept safe. He has taken the Riverlands and the North, and he knows that we lie here, in the safety of the mountain. He will be marching on us soon.” Jon said

“ He has only taken two of the seven kingdoms. I will not allow him to take any more. How do expect people to follow a Queen, who won’t put her life at risk for them. I have given birth already. There is no need for safety any longer. I cannot go to King's Landing to sit on the throne due to the fact that Cersei of the House Lannister sits on the throne, and sleeps in my Royal Apartments within the Red Keep, while high walls, and millions of people defend her. We need a solution.” Daenerys said

“My brother has is a greenseer. The most powerful of all. He has the sight. He is the three eyed raven. He can see the past and the future, he can see all that happens here, and a thousand leagues away all while it’s happening, all at the same time. He says there is only one solution left and only you can hear it.” Jon said 

“Then call him for me. Let’s see what this Brandon Stark has to say.” Daenerys said

Jon left the room with the Maester. After ten minutes Brandon came into the room, spread across his wheelchair, his features askew.

“Brandon, my dearest. How are you.? Daenerys asked

“There’s no time for formalities. I’m living, you’re living, but something else marches on the realm. Something with a different form of magic. Something that relishes in destruction and decay. A being that takes away life, and brings death. That something is the Night King, that something is the White Walkers. That something is the hundreds of thousands of dead people that march behind him. But we have a solution.” Brandon said 

“What is that solution. I have two dragons at my disposal. I have a hundred thousand men who will kill at my command.” Daenerys said 

“If only that was the answer. I have looked into past and the future, I have looked into the flames. You are the answer. Jon Snow is not the answer. Your dragons and your men are not the answer. Yours is the song of ice and fire. You, Daenerys must be given to the Night King. It is the sacrifice that the realm needs. For eons the white walkers have taken humans to foster into the next Night King, yet always failing due to the constitution of the blood. The Night King now knows that you hold the constitution needed for the accession of a new King. He will not stop until he gets what he wants. This must be done.” Brandon said 

Daenerys began to sob clinging at the bed sheets, holding the blankets as hard as she could. She stumbled off the bed and laid on the floor, trying to grasp some sort of foundation, some sort of stability. She laid there for close to an hour, Brandon patiently waiting.

“Ever since I can remember, I was told of tales about my brother Rhaegar who I named my dragon after. The man who valiantly went to the crossroads and tried to fight off the usurper Robert Baratheon and failed with no avail. I was told that I am the last Targaryen, the one who needed to bring back the Royal House of Targaryen back to strength. Told that I must sit on the throne. Told that I must rule this kingdom. I see, now, my role in it all. I see my fate. I must do what is necessary. I must serve the realm. In the end I will become a Queen. Just not the kind that I always thought. Don’t tell Jon. I must do it without him knowing. Only afterward shall they know my sacrifice. Take care of my child. Take care of Jon.” Daenerys said 

“You must hurry. Ride Drogon to the crossroads, and give yourself to him. He will take you to the Lands of Always Winter. The ritual will begin and you shall become the Night's King, forced by magic to hold your dominion where the Wall once stood. Frozen in ice for eons until the time comes again to find an heir. Then the cycle will begin again..” Brandon said

“I am the Mother of Dragons. I am the azor Ahai. I am the blood of Old Valyria. My time has come. I shall bring a new dawn, and hold a new position. Goodbye my friend. Tell Jon to move on. To find a new purpose. To take my dragons and my child, fly south and take Kings Landing. He shall become King, and raise our child to do the same. A new age shall begin.” Daenerys said

“That I will do.” Brandon said 

“Valar Morghulis. All men must die. Valar Dohaeris. All men must serve. An ancient formality said to all in my mother tongue, High Valyrian. And so I must serve. And so I must die  

Daenerys got up, put on her coat, wrapped her hair up into a bun, and put her boots on. She put her arm in the fire. Feeling its warmth for the last time. She put on her crown and walked down the hall. Daenerys walked past the nursery, tears in her eyes, not able to say bye, while everyone laughed and cheered inside. Daenerys walked past the throne room and up the stairs. The next step surer than the last. She walked into the garden, the sun going down. She realized a day had come and gone. Just like her life had. But now it had more meaning than it ever did. She climbed Drogon who shrieked, beckoning to his mother. 

“Sōves” said Daenerys *“fly”*

“Dracarys” commanded Daenerys *“dragonfire”*

Drogon breathed fire into the night sky, taking her back to the first few days she brought dragons into the world after hundreds of years of extinction. Daenerys flew fast, towards the crossroads, to meet her fate.",gameofthrones,True,1535916497,2018-09-02

[Spoilers] What's the worst scene in the show that you never see anyone else complain about?,"For me, it's the scene where proto-Daario and the two other sellsword captains are deciding who will go kill Daenerys or whatever, and Daario pulls out three coins, one square one round and one triangular I think, and says whoever gets the Braavos coin does the deed. 

So, this is already stupid as shit because ***the coins are different fucking shapes***. But it gets worse.

He gives the coins to a whore and blindfolds her before having her blindly go to each man and give him a coin. ***Why the hell is SHE blindfolded? And why does SHE pick which coin to hand them?*** 

Not that letting them pick their own uniquely shaped coins would be much better, but it's just so many unnecessary steps that all boil down to one thing, ""let's have this prostitute pick which one of us does an assassination.""

It's by far the worst sexposition the show has ever done, it's not even sexposition really because there's no exposition, just a topless chick they agree to let rig a random drawing. AND this takes place in s3 when they still have plenty of GRRM material to adapt, but nope, they decide ***this scene*** is worth writing, casting, and spending a shitload of money shooting.

[Spoilers] I've finally put my finger on why THAT DEATH in S7 annoyed me so much,"***/Spoilers here for the S7 finale folks! I've not tagged a spoiler post before, so I hope I've done it right (Mods please help me fix it if not)./***

Watching Arya cut open Baelish's throat and watching Sansa start to emerge as a force was incredibly satisfying. For about thirty seconds, after which I started to get annoyed. Baelish was a very clever man; clever enough to have killed a king and gotten away with it, and to have killed several other high-power figures and come away unscathed. It didn't feel right for him to be taken down in the way that he was.

For me, everything about the plot leading up to Baelish's death was messy. I get that they were gunning for a ""will they/won't they"" thing between Arya and Sansa, especially given that the sisters had a turbulent foundation upon which to build, but for me the execution was poor. Re-ordering the scenes could have made the sequence a lot more powerful. In my mind:

* The scene where Baelish tells Sansa about his Little Game (assuming the worst reasons for every action) should have come much sooner. If not at the end of S6 then immediately after Baelish sees the fight between Arya and Brienne. That for me is the moment that Baelish starts feeling uncertain; Sansa now has two trained warriors on her side who can easily outmatch him physically. He needs to secure his place at Sansa's side.

* Then there should have been the scenes with Baelish acquiring Sansa's letter and hiding it so that Arya could find it. 

* Then the confrontation of Arya and Sansa over the letter - which, as it was in the show, seemed jarring and out of place. We know Arya loves a bit of drama (Merryn Trant and the Freys have proved that) but her idea of drama is *doing* something, not just walking around monologue-ing about this one time she shot an arrow and she wasn't told off for it.

* After this, there should have been another scene with Sansa and Baelish: ""Remember my little game? What's the worst reason she could have for using this letter against you?"", guiding Sansa to the 'Lady of Winterfell' conclusion.

* Then the conversation in the bedroom about playing the Game of Faces. Arya's handing over of the knife should have been more significant - a silent nod to 'We're both being played, we both know who's behind it, I'll follow your lead' which I think was too understated in the episode. 

* Then the (shouldn't-have-been-cut) scene with Bran - even if it's just that we see Sansa going in to Bran's room but we don't hear the conversation. 

* Resolving in the scene where Arya's ""trial"" quickly turns on Peter (the only part of the arc that I did like. Honestly, I'm not sure if I prefer Arya's ""My sister asked you a question."" or Sansa's ""Which of the charges don't you understand?"")

People argued after the episode aired that Baelish was blinded by his love for Sansa, which I disagree with. He might love Sansa, but she is still a pawn to be played in the great game. If he loved her the same way he loved Catelyn he would have found a way for her to avoid Ramsey's cruelty (like a marriage and a murder, *a la* Joffrey). And I don't want to argue that he underestimated them because they're children; Arya's fight against Brienne was significant to Baelish, and Bran unnerved him with a simple sentence. 

I think the writers missed out on a great opportunity to really pay homage to Baelish's intellect. In the end he was taken down by a trio of unmatchable force: a trained assassin, aboy who knows everything, and a girl with whom he shared a lot of his wisdom. Bran knew what he had done before, Sansa could best predict what he might do next, and Arya was the best to sneak around and gather intel on what he was doing now. 

In the end it took supernatural assistance to bring him to heel - three minds gathering as much as they could in the past, present and future - and I think this was lost in an overly convoluted storyline.

[Spoilers] Jaime's Death - Change my mind,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1535993814,2018-09-03
[Spoilers] Jaime's Fate - Change my mind,"I'm of the opinion that if Jaime dies early into the next book/season, it'd be an okay ending to his arc. No, its not the best possible or the only possible end for him - but its narratively and thematically consistent with the rest of the series.

**Books:** Brienne takes Jaime to LSH. After the shock of seeing her alive, you spend some guilt-ridden time as Jaime reflects on his crimes. He's then either killed via execution or in an escape attempt.

**Show:** Jaime doesn't get the welcome he expects in the North - everyone still hates him and his family, especially for Cersei's latest betrayal. He's then executed as a political move of Dany's part.

I hold these outcomes to be fitting for the series for the following reasons:

1. The series is known for its shocking and unexpected deaths. At this point, most of the fans seem certain that Jaime would stay alive until he completes his redemption arc - so him dying here would fit the ""plot-twist"" criteria the series is famous for.

2. Its not just a twist for the sake of it. It fits perfectly with all the other major deaths we've had. ""Your actions/mistakes catch up to you before you can fulfill your goal"" - this is a recurring theme for GoT deaths. Viserys unwisely trying to force Drogo causes his death before he even gets his hands on an army. Drogo's atrocities causes his death before he can set sail for Westeros. Ned never gets to fix things in KL or ensure his daughters' safety. Renly is poised to become a major threat with the biggest army - but gets killed before the battle even starts. Robb never gets to secure his kingdom or save his sisters. Oberyn never gets to avenge Elia and her children. Tywin never gets to secure his legacy. The element of tragedy is same in all of them - all these characters had a goal or an agenda they were desperate to achieve and all of them died before they could achieve it. Jaime suffering the same fate - of having his actions and his family's catch up to him before he can redeem himself - fits the theme of the series.

3. It preserves the element of realism and character consistency. Most of the theories regarding Jaime surviving require people to start acting out-of-character. Like the Northerners simply getting over their hatred of the Lannisters. Or LSH caring about rational evidence or fair play. Or the BwB being moved by Jaime's speech. Where LSH is concerned, she should want Jaime dead asap and hang the formalities. And with Dany and the North, scapegoating Jaime is a great political move. In the end, it'd show that the logical flow of the story matters more than any one character's journey.

4. It also highlights the difference between character perspective and audience perspective. Most of the audience consider Jaime to be a redeemed good guy but that's because we are privy to his pov. Most of the characters, however, consider him to be the irredeemable villain who caused one of the most devastating civil wars in the history of Westeros because he couldn't keep his hands off his sister.

5. Someone else killing Cersei would be fine as well. Let's be honest - the main reason why people want Jaime to survive and get back to KL is because they want him to be the one who kills Cersei. The irony of him being the Valonqar - the one person Cersei never considered - seems too deliciously ironic to pass up. But that's not essential to the story. In fact, I'd say that twisting the story in unnatural ways just to make that happen would be doing it a disservice.

So based on these reasons, I'm perfectly fine with the possibility of Jaime dying early into the next book/season.

However, here's what I don't understand - the very notion of Jaime dying like this sends a lot of fans into a passionate frenzy. For a lot of them, this outcome is simply unacceptable. For a lot of them, it seems like this end would be the worst thing ever.

Can anyone help me understand this POV? Yes, I get that fans want Jaime to complete his redemption arc and have his story end a particular way - specifically, with killing Cersei - but that's what the fans want. What they want and what the author wants is not the same thing.

So can anyone give me a rational explanation as to why this ending would be so terrible? Beyond what boils down to ""I don't want it to end that way"", that is?

[SPOILERS] MORE EVIDENCE TO WHY JON'S CLAIM TO THE THRONE MIGHT NOT BE AS STRONG AS YOU THINK,"First, let me say that I really think it could go either way, ""legally"" speaking according to Westerosi succession laws, as Jon's situation includes some details which have never had to be considered before.  I do, however, continue to see people refer to Jon as ""the true heir"" or ""the rightful heir"", as if Dany simply has no claim now because Jon does.....and that just isn't true. If Jon's claim does put him in line before Dany, that doesn't then render her claim illegitimate.  It's just as legit as ever, she'd just be second in line, which actually doesn't matter anyway since 1) Jon would never EVER contest Dany's claim to the throne for himself. He's sworn an oath to her and he won't break it to step in line in front of her for a throne he doesn't even want.  Whether he actually IS first in line or not, the ONLY way Jon will ever take the throne is if Dany dies (which I believe it's possible she might, while giving birth to her and Jon's child).

But let's get back to the whole ""rightful heir""-thing and the claim that Jon is now first in line for the throne.  Is he though?  If all things were ""normal"" and nothing out of the ordinary had happened, then yes, he would be........but that isn't the case.  First, Jon joined the Night's Watch and when he did, whether knowingly or not, he gave up any right to the line of succession, putting Dany first in line.  NW vows are for life.  And here's where things get REALLY murky: does it then mean that because Jon died and was brought back to life that his NW vows actually ended, and he was then put back into the line of succession?  First off, normally if you, for whatever reason, take yourself out of the line of succession, you stay out.....even if you want back in.  But let's say that doesn't apply here.  Since no one in Westeros would've EVER had to deal with this issue before, a person in line for the throne dying and coming back to life, whether or not his NW vows actually still hold, not whether or not he FEELS like they hold, is unknown.  And if all that wasn't enough, Jon is only in line at all because his real father got a secret (SECRET!!!) annulment and then had a SECRET marriage to Jon's mother. The only things that ""prove"" this is a single piece of paper from the Citadel and visions Bran had, which is really hardly enough evidence to convince an entire country that Jon is legit.  That doesn't mean it won't happen, it's just pretty flimsy stuff, really.  There is absolutely NO DOUBT whatsoever, by anyone, that Dany's claim is real.

So, we're really left not knowing if Jon truly is first in line or if the majority would even buy it if he is.  But again, unless Dany dies, the whole thing is moot anyway.

Below is a a better description of all this. The details on succession laws/traditions are based on British monarchies, which is what Hirst based the Westerosi one on. A link is included to the full page:

"" Yes, But The Succession Still Isn't Clear
By and large Westerosi succession tends to follow European law, and there are cases where the former King dies in a period in which his widow-Queen is still fertile, and the Heir Apparent is a woman. There was a case in recent English law where a Queen would have ascended the throne immediately, but they said ""hey, if the King's widow happens to be pregnant and gives birth to a boy, that boy would replace you as King immediately."" (The same hubbub happened when Queen Elizabeth II ascended because it was not impossible her mom was pregnant with a boy).

Obviously very few people in Westeros knew that the annulment had taken place and that Lyanna had a claim to be Rhaegar's legitimate wife, but this is examining from a perspective of us, the viewers, who know The Truth, and puts the Crown as a high-concept thing that is always with the legitimate heir by law, even if nobody knows it.

The position of King by the Crown was temporarily in limbo because Lyanna was pregnant, and the second the boy who would be known as Jon Snow popped out he immediately became the rightful King by Targaryen claims. The Crown followed him, even if, just like Jon Snow, everyone knew nothing about it.

So wait, he's the heir, why do you say the succession isn't clear?
Because it's all Ned Stark's fault.

The only person in Westeros we can know for sure knew this was Ned Stark. He knew Robert would murder the baby on the spot, and he couldn't let that happen to his nephew, so he passed the boy off as his own bastard son.

The Crown still never left Jon Snow, he was still always the rightful heir... until the moment he took the Black.

As always, Jon Snow knew nothing, but Eddard Stark was likely greatly relieved, because at that moment Jon Snow ceased to be the rightful King and it passed to the presumed holder all along, Viserys Targaryen.

Under the principles of the Monarchy Never Dies, There Is Always A Ruler, and the Targaryen claim that they were still the rightful Kings (actually sitting the Iron Throne is irrelevant), Jon Snow had been king from the moment of his birth, and his technical heir ascended to the throne the moment that black cloak hit Jon Snow's shoulders and he became a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

Viserys, of course, died, and since Jon Snow was still in the Watch, it passed to his heir, Daenerys Targaryen. 
But Jon died (and got better), why isn't he the rightful heir, since his vows ended?
Because there is no legal precedent for making a monarch who rightfully and legally inherited the throne to immediately abdicate just because someone popped up along the former line of succession.

The fact that none of these kings sat on the Iron Throne is irrelevant. Coronation doesn't make a person the monarch, they become monarch the moment they inherit it from the former one (or else they wouldn't style themselves Kings and Queens, even in exile).

Don't get me wrong, Jon Snow has a very strong claim, and he could press it in either a legal proceeding (and probably lose) or on the field of battle (and probably lose), or through murder (which doesn't seem Jon's style).

But given that there is no precedent for Jon Snow actually escaping the vows of the Night's Watch, from which only death allows escape, it's unclear if Daenerys would legally be forced to abdicate immediately, or if Jon would merely be re-added to the line of succession (conveniently as Dany's heir, assuming she doesn't give birth to a male child (or female, given that Dany would probably press for a change to the succession laws)).

This is all setting aside the problems Jon would have actually proving his claim, from which all the people in universe would know is, Jon's 'brother' is having visions, and a single book that was conveniently stolen from Oldtown by Jon's best friend (and could therefore be a forgery). We, as the Viewers, know is claim his true and just. But the characters aren't blessed with our omniscience (except maybe Bran...).""

Dire Wolves Symbolism [SPOILERS],"So I know I’m rather late to the GOT party. I only started watching about a month ago, and then binged all 7 seasons in a matter of weeks. I liked it much more than I thought I would. So forgive me if this topic has already been discussed at great length, but like I said, I’m new!
So I think it’s pretty clear each Stark child’s wolf is symbolic of the Stark child themselves: Jon’s wolf is named “Ghost,” and Jon died and came back, a little like a ghost. Bran’s wolf died in the cave, just like Bran’s former self died in the cave. Sansa’s wolf was cut down young at the hands of the Lannisters, just like Sansa was taken from her family young and had her innocence stripped away prematurely, etc.
Arya’s also seems straight forward, as she sent her wolf on the run, and Arya spent much of the series on the run herself. But then, when she encounters that dire wolf in the forest, she determines, “that’s not you.”
What do you think this means? Is this some kind of foreshadowing that Arya is, in some ways, “no one?”",gameofthrones,True,1536085532,2018-09-04
A Random Thought...it was all Lianna Starks Fault,Was re-watching the last two seasons of the show and based on the story as presented this entire chain of events was set off not by Littlefinger but by Lianna Stark.  She could have certainly gotten word to Ned that she hadn't been kidnapped and that she willingly went with Rhaegar.  So in summation the Starks are idiots who destabilized an entire continent because they couldn't send a damn raven.,gameofthrones,True,1536086139,2018-09-04

[SPOILERS] Can Jon Snow be the Night King?!,"
The story of the Night King being the 13th Lord Commander of the Nights-Watch ends when the King of Winterfell, the 13th lord commander’s brother, puts an end in him. Now history can repeat its self in two ways:
1)Bran Stark is the Night King and Jon Snow (King of Winterfell) puts an end in him.

2)Jon Snow is the Night King and Bran Stark (Rightful king of Winterfell) puts an end him.  This is more possible since Jon Snow had a history in the Nights Watch and is Bran’s brother. Jon also had affairs from people beyond the wall.",gameofthrones,True,1536089871,2018-09-04

This post end at  season 3,  I'll make a few corrections / additions in **bold and continue their work .**

 

&gt;**Season 1**  
Lannisters march for Tyrion:  
&gt;  
&gt;**S1E3 Maester Aemon says that there is less than a thousand men in the Night´s Watch.**  
*S01E07* 5:30 min in - Tywin says he'll give Jaime half of his forces, 30000 men, to head to Riverrun while Tywin's 30000 head to the Vale to free Tyrion.The North's march for Ned Stark:  
*S01E08* 40min in: Robb says his scouts report reinforcements for Tywin's army from the south (don't know if it's from King's Landing) are headed to join up with Tywin's 30000, the reinforcements are larger than Tywin's 30000. Robb then tells his mother the Northerners have 18000 at that point. Tywin gets reported Robb's forces have rushed into The Neck. A couple minutes later, Robb's battle map shows he's past Greywater Watch, halfway to The Twins, with Jamie's forces a little southwest of Riverrun, and Tywin's forces south of the river, north of Harrenhal. The Northerners capture a Lannister scout who says he counted 20000 Northerners before he got caught (I don't know if he's lying).  
*S01E09* 6:45min in - Theon says Robb has 5 times more men than the Freys do at The Twins, making the Frey army 4000 men (a ton of foreshowing in this scene btw). Frey gives all of his men except 400 to Robb under the conditions **(This 400 probably are like a Household Guard).** I'm assuming Robb is +3600 at this point, but Robb goes -2000 after sending them against Tywin's forces. Jamie's forces get wiped out, but nothing about the loses on either side after this battle near Riverrun.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Also Yoren says to arya that Ned Strak have 50 men of their Household Guard at KL. Also Ned sends 100 men to capture The Mountain. Ned says to littlefinger that Cersei have a dozen of Knights ( maybe the Kingsguard and others) and a hundred of men, also says that the City Watch have 2000 strong men.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Season 1 Summary**  
Starks and their bannermen = **21600**  
Lannisters = +60000  
Daenerys = Three baby dragons **(and some Dothraky with horses)**.  
**Season 2**  
*S02E01 - S02E04* \- Robb says if he allies with Renly Baratheon, They'll outnumber the Lannisters 2:1 **(Renly 100000 plus Robb +20000 is +120000/2 is 60000 Lannisters,  that means that somehow after 3 defeats the Lannisters still have more than 60000 men)** **Robb says that Balon Greyjoy have 200 ships,** **taking into account that the crew of the Sea Bitch (Theon) was 22 and that of the Sea Wind (Yara) was 50 ironborn that means a total of 4400-10000 ironborn.** Salladhor Saan says Stannis has the smallest army out of all the kings. Renly + Tyrells stand at 100000 men. Robb has another battle, 5 Lannister men fall for every Stark man, and it's getting really hazy where their number stands. **I remember that Craster says to Jeor that Mance Rayder have 100000 wildings, confirmed lately.**  
*S02E05* \- Stannis gathers the Baratheon bannermen fighting for Renly while the Tyrells take their army to meet up with Tywin's. I have no idea where Renly's assassination takes place nor how their army was split up. **Tyrion have 7800 pots of wildfire...Rodrick Cassel recruit 200 ""decent men"" when the ironborn attack Torrhen´s Square.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**S2E6 The letter that Arya stole from Tywin says that 10000 northmen march to the Golden Tooth.**  
*S02E07-08* Robb's forces are located south of the Pyke at The Crag to negotiate a surrender, it's right above Castamere. I never realized until now he's right above Casterly Rock. Tywin's army heads to King's Landing before meeting up with the Tyrells. **Roose Bolton sends Ramsay with a few hundred (500) to recapture Winterfell.**   **Tyrion tells Ceresi that 200 ships of the Stannis Royal Fleet was seen north of Tarth, 30 are from Saan´s fleet.**  
*S02E09 - S02E10* Stannis vs. the Lannisters/Tyrells. I didn't try very hard, but I couldn't find the number of men on either side in either episode. **( Mathos says that they outnumber the KL defense by 5: 1 - Gold Cloaks and Lannister guards - and 10-1 their fleet, so the Royal Fleet of KL is 20 ships, as for the numbers of soldiers I could not find a source that says how many Stannis had)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Season 2 Summary**  
Starks and their bannermen  **+20000**  
Lannisters + Tyrells = +100000 I'm assuming, at least 80000.  
Stannis - After a quick glance, I realize they never say the number of men in Stannis' army, someone correct me if I'm wrong. **200 ships (30 sellsails)**  
Daenerys - 3 Tiny Dragons, some Dothraki and a ship.  
**Season 3**  
*S03E01 - S03E04* \- Robb's forces are at Harrenhal coming all the way from the west. He then heads west again to Riverrun for his Grandfather's funeral. No numbers still.  
*S03E05 - S03E08* \- Robb beheads Rickard Karstark and loses ""almost half his forces"". If the 20000 was correct before, it probably means the remaining forces are at 11000 - 12000 men. He heads to Casterly Rock again, but not before going to the Twins for Frey's men, again. **- I sincerely believe that Karstark has an absurd number of men.**  
 **S3E9 Red Wedding**

I left out some parts that were already written in the comments like Lady Olenna telling Tyrion in S03E05 18 minutes in she donated

&gt;12000 infantry men  
1800 mounted lancers  
2000 in support

to the Crown.

Daenerys stands at 8000 Unsullied and 2000 from the Second Sons.

**Season 4**

S4E6  Stannis and Davos at the Iron Bank say they have 4000 men and 32 ships after Blackwater, **keeping this in mind I would say that if 4000 men are on 32 ships then 200/32 = 6.25 \* 4000 = 25000 men that Stannis PROBABLY had before Blackwater, if we take into account Mathos's comment on how they outnumbered the KL defense, it means that Tyrion commanded 5000 men, of these 5000 we know that 2000 were gold cloaks, but I could not say the number of Lannister guards if there were conscripts of the City Watch.**  
S4E8-S4E9 After the wilding attack in Mole´s Town there is 100 crows in Castle Black against 100000 wildings, 50 crows die at the following battle.

This images show that there is 2774 cavalry in Stannis army.

The editor has swapped round loads of the dialogue which makes the scene seem really weird and really funny. It's only around 30 seconds long and takes place when Robert first arrives at Winterfell.

Question regarding killing wights/white walkers,"Hey everyone, new to this subreddit after binging the whole series (currently doing a 2nd watch thru) and hours upon hours of youtube theories haha. While im catching a lot of things the 2nd time around, I have a question about the season 7 finale.

In the finale we see Jon demonstrate how to kill the wights with the wight they captured. Before stabbing it with the dragon glass, the Hound had sliced it in half with a normal sword and it was still alive

However, in the previous episode during the suicide mission as well as in Hardhome, many people were killing wights with average weapons (highly doubt any were made of dragon glass or valyrian steel). Correct me if im wrong but isn’t it only the white walkers that the dragon glass / valyrian steel are used for to kill? And wights can be killed with any weapon?

Curious to hear your opinions. 

Also this is off topic but am I the only one who thinks that ppl are giving Tyrion too much credit? I love Tyrion but most (if not all) his plans end in disaster because he has a habit of underestimating his opponents.

[SPOILERS] The bar is incredibly high for Game Of Thrones,"I've heard people say they won't really be happy with the ending, whatever it is, unless it's not predictable at all, and all that makes me think is Damn! the bar is extremely high for a lot of people when it comes to Game Of Thrones, yes I know GoT has probably given us more OMG moments than any other tv show or movie in history but as the story comes to an end it also gets harder to give as many surprises when the characters are all developed and you can't just change how they've acted the whole series (which would indeed be bad writing if they did that). I honestly thought ""Breaking Bad is in my top 3 fav shows ever (Along with GoT) but damn I'm sure all of us saw the ending coming (Walt dying while saving Jesse and finally admitting to his wife that he did all those things because he actually enjoyed it) a mile away"" it was a predictable ending and a great one, I feel Game Of Thrones has become so big and has masterfully created a fantasy world where almost everything seems to click, that now we nitpick the show on every minor detail (expectations for S8 are just one example).

I guess it goes to show how it's made us grow to expect the very best from it. :)",gameofthrones,True,1536137988,2018-09-05

https://motmansy.polldaddy.com/s/the-best-game-of-thrones-characters-of-2018
It has been over a year since the second season of Game of Thrones has come to an end. Yet again, I want to investigate whether public opinion toward the selection of the best Game of Thrones has changed over the course of the year. Last edition, Daenerys Targaryen took over the spot of Jon Snow as the best character of the epic TV series. Is the Dragon Queen still as popular after a year that the last season has aired? It’s time for the Redditors to gather and vote for the fourth edition of the Top 50 best Game of Thrones characters!
Rules
- You can only vote for 10 characters, no less. It’s entirely up to you if you’d like to vote for fewer characters than 10.
- Deadline for voting: Wednesday, September 12th. Results will be online before next weekend, right before the Emmy’s take place.
- It would be awesome if you upvote my post. The more people to see the post, the more votes I get which will add up to an even more reliable top 50. And to be frank, I’m not into upvote whoring.
- Please don’t troll vote! I remember a LOT of votes for Grey Worm in a past year. ;-)
- If I have forgotten one of your favourite characters on the list, please let me know via a comment in Polldaddy. I’ll try to include your character asap. Normally all TV characters are included. Note that this poll only measures the popularity of the TV characters, not the book characters!

Four criteria (which can help you to choose your 10 favourite characters)
- The acting of the actor/actress =&gt; Did the actor/actress ever touch your soul with his/her performance? How good is the actor/actress in expressing her feelings in Game of Thrones? Are the actor’s / actress’s acting skills consistent throughout all the season(s)?
- The storyline(s) of the character =&gt; Were/was the storyline(s) of the character consistently interesting? Was there a strong building-up in her/his storyline each season? Was/Were the storyline(s) of the character not too predictable? Was the character’s fleshed out enough each season? How was the pace of his/her storyline(s)?
- Character development =&gt; How good is the character fleshed out? Does the character have enough depth? Is he/she likable in her/his role? Did the character develop each season and how strong was this development? Look at the character’s current state: how strong was his development up to now?
- The uniqueness of the character =&gt; Did the character’s actions surprise through the seasons of Game of Thrones? Wasn’t the character too repetitive in his/her actions? Did the character never cease to amaze you or did he/she ever started to bore you?

The New 3DS XL is adult owned, and has skinomi protectors on the front plate, back plate, and lower screen of the 3DS. There are light scuff marks on the top screen that can only be seen if powered off and held in a angle, they are non visible during use. The 3DS has been installed with the latest CFW, which is completely safe to update and use. The 3DS will not be coming with any games, what you see on the menu is what you can play as long as CFW is still on the system. I’m firm on $200 shipped via USPS, it will be packaged safely.

The Binding of Issac is in great condition and works perfectly. The case itself has a few light scratches that are hard to photograph, and it did not come with a manual when I purchased it from Walmart for some reason. Firm on $24.50 shipped.

Monster Hunter XX is in great condition, the game works perfectly but is in Japanese. $24 shipped.

Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is brand new and still sealed, I’m firm on $55 shipped.

The honey is unopened and currently out of production as of 2016, it’s officially licensed from Capcom japan. Was a pain in the ass to import, but I’ll let it go for $20 shipped.

All sales will be through PayPal Goods &amp; Services, I will not accept any other forms of payment.

[SPOILERS] Night's watch theory,"First of all sorry if this has been suggested before. I know there are theories on how the NW might continue to exist even with the Wall and WW gone , but I don't think this has been suggested before.

I have been rewatching the show and are currently on season 5. Here Davos says something that might hint at the NW possible survival . 

After Jon declines Stannis' offer to make him Jon Stark , Davos asks Olly to say the NW vows.  When Olly says "" the shield that guards the realms of men "" Davos stops him . 
Davos then says: ""As long as the Boltons rule the North , the North will suffer "" 

What Davos hoped to acheive with this was for Jon to accept the offer from Stannis , but it go me thinking that the NW might still have a purpose after the NK are defeated. 

The Night's watch will continue to be the "" shield that guards the realms of men "" , but it won't be from wildlings or White walkers they will protect the realm from people like the Boltons , Cersei , Euron etc. Simply to stop people who wants to supress the people for own gains .

So my suggestion is that the NW will continue to exist as a sort of peacekeeping force in the realm . 

TL:DR: The Night's watch will continue to exist as a military order , but their new function will be as a peacekeeping force who fights for the people and for justice.

(Discussion),"I’ve been watching/rewatching House lately and I noticed that every season something big happens but by the end of that season it gets resolved, everything goes back to the beginning and nothing has changed, House is still House. Same with Lost almost the entire series goes by and everyone more or less either doesn’t change or changes for a time then reverts to the original point. Same in The Walking Dead, the setting changes but the people stay the same. It feels like Game Of Thrones is really the only show on today where if you watch Episode 1 and then watch episode 67 it would feel like you were watching 2 different shows, that is because the world and characters of GoT actually change and evolve, die and give up, it feels like the only show where the actions of the characters and the events of the world actually cause changes in the characters and the way they act and perceive the world. Just look at Sansa or Arya and they’re completely different people in both the way they act and think compared to the start of the show. In contrast Carl from TWD is the same all they was to the end except he got older and could do more stuff, Rick got older and could do less stuff but as characters they basically stayed the same. I think that’s one of the big reasons why GoT is so much superior to every other show out there.  ",gameofthrones,True,1534825268,2018-08-21

"[Spoilers] Who is better at world-building, George R.R. Martin or J.R Tolkien?","Both of them created huge fantasy worlds enriched with history, culture languages and creatures.  I personally however think that George Martin is better at world building because he used more original ideas to create Westeros and the rest of the game of thrones world.  J.R Tolkien is one of the best story-tellers in fantasy but in creating his world he relied a lot on Germanic folklore specifically Norse mythology. I know that George based his work on other sources too (including LOTR) but to me it seems that lot of the ideas were his own. ",gameofthrones,True,1534850469,2018-08-21

[NO SPOILERS] How is Jamie's and Cersie's relationship explained in the books?,"Despite all the horrible things that happen in the world, the brother sister incest is the one thing i can't wrap by head around.

[Spoilers] Theory: It was Bran,"About s7e6. We know Suicidekru sent Genny B to run to the wall and send the raven to Dany, who came flying with her dragons to beyind the wall.

But it has been argued that the timeline doesn't match up (maybe cause Genny B is tapping the speedforce, and subconsciously putting his dick in the timeline? Just kidding)

Now we do know Bran is a warg. And he was scouting the area. I honestly believe he influenced the events surrounding Dany going north a lot.

I hope they address it in season 8, it increases the importance of Bran.",gameofthrones,True,1534861309,2018-08-21
[SPOILERS] what if Lyanna stark and rhaegar were public about their love.,"I've been thinking what would happen if lyanna and rhaegar came forward and made it clear that their love was there to stay instead of just running away. Of course Robert would be irate but I think the combination of ned stark and lyanna talking to him could calm him down but most likely not. Neds father may not accept such an arrangement due to the weight of the stark word and her being bethroed to robert but again I think it would be an argument and not a full on war that would eventually end with him disowning her, and again not war. Rhaegar would take over as the king of the seven kingdoms as the mad king dies....one big thing I think would happen is the role reversal of the stark and Martell story. The starks would be behind the king (after strong pushing from both ned and Brandon to support their lovely sister) but I think oberyn martell and his brother would have waged war on the seven kingdoms with the help of an irate baratheon family over this arrangement. The vale would stay out of the conflict due to Jon arryns allegiance to both robert and ned. The Lannister army would again wait on the outside and stay neutral. The tully's would join the crown and the starks as Brandon stark would be married to catelyn Tully. The crown would win and we could see a jon snow and dany prearranged marriage with peace around the 7 kingdoms....littlefinger would be killed by Brandon stark after getting annoyed with his games....what do you all think?",gameofthrones,True,1534865098,2018-08-21
[SPOILERS] An omitted character could have made for an interesting what if story -,"Young Griff was omitted from the show (he was also supposedly an ""Aegon"") so if the books ever catch up to the show in terms of Jon's heritage we will have an interesting dilemma. Jon could be revealed as an Aegon (he is a true Aegon) where Griff will be a fake Aegon. Will they go to war, make peace or will it all have been as some kind of plot?

Either way the show elected to do away with this whole concept and focus on ONE and only one Aegon. Odds are whatever GrrM is doing with this story would take too long to incorporate into the show and divert from the main thrust, Jon is Aegon. But GrrM does nothing by accident so this character will have a role. 

So I got to thinking about Ned, Jon/Aegon and the impostor Aegon. While I don't think this is the case it is technically possible due to the dates and timelines. 

Not one, but two romances happened at the tourney. 

*According to Allyria Dayne, Ashara and Ned Stark fell in love at Harrenhal.Barristan was also in love with Ashara, although he never told her so. Barristan believes that Ashara was dishonored by someone at Harrenhal.*

So it is physically possible for Jon to have been sired at Harrenhal by Rhaegar but it is also possible for Ned to have sired a child. Ned loved Ashara, Ashara was ""dishonored"" possibly. 

One counterpoint before everyone jumps on Ned is so honorable he wouldn't do this:

Ned is a human being. *Ashara was tall, with long dark hair and haunting violet eyes. She had a reputation for great beauty.* She was really hot and if she chose Ned, then you can't say for sure young Ned would resist. Ned was very shy and she might have been the aggressor, sound familiar? Jon Snow is Ned's son in more ways than anyone else and he broke his vow with Ygritte. Ned might have assumed he would marry her anyway and it wouldn't matter. 

So what if Ashara was pregnant and Ned never knew until after he killed her brother in combat? If Young Griff turned out to be Ned's son, sent away and meant to be another diversion to hide the real Aegon it would be ironic on many levels. 

That would mean that Ned raised a boy as a bastard who was born in wedlock and was the actual Prince of Westeros. He called him Jon Snow when he was Aegon and he was told his whole life he was a bastard.

That would also mean Ned sired an actual bastard, this bastard was raised as if he was a Targ, called Aegon and had all the respect Jon never did. 

Ned's bastard son would be an interesting foil for the real Aegon/Jon Snow. In many ways he would be the antithesis. Everything Jon was accused of being. I doubt GrrM will go this route but it was an interesting thought that Jon could be battling Ned's actual bastard for the throne. I can also see why the show omitted this. With so much going on its not like Jon needs yet another hurdle...he has plenty of issues...",gameofthrones,True,1534865895,2018-08-21

Night King's goal...,"I just had a blurb of a thought about the Night King's end goal.

For reasons I'm  not going to explain here, I believe the NK is Jorah Mormont.  That his spirit somehow went back in time ( like everyone assumes Bran will ) and is inhabiting the body of the guy who got turned into the NK by the Children.  Again... not going to explain that theory here.

But what I thought of today is ...

What if the NK is on the move to defend Dany?  She'll have Cersie's army coming for her.  If the NK knows the future (he seems to know where to be and when) then he might know Dany will be in trouble and wants to come to her aid the only way he can... with an undead army.

If I'm right about the NK being Jorah... he would totally come to her defense. He would have waited 8 thousand years to do so.

[Spoilers] Why do you like Sansa? No haters please.,"I think most people who hate Sansa hate her for similar and obvious reasons and I used to hate her too until I spent more time with the books.

GRRM seems to have a love/hate relationship with fantasy stereotypes and Sansa seems to be a parody of it early on.  After a while I felt that Sansa was GRRM’s way of crapping on those princess in a tower tropes and then she became a lot more interesting.  All of the characters deal with reality checks but maybe none more than Sansa.  There might be no one less deserving of the pain she is dealt. She still isn’t someone I would like to hang out with but I’ve come to love what she represents.

[SPOILERS] White Walkers/NK theory thoughts and questions ahead of final season...,"( I'm writing as things pop in my head so I'm not over thinking here, just seeing if there is any credence in it ) 

Honestly, I love thinking about GOT but I know that most of mine and others people's theories aren't going to even fit into the jigsaw. I also think ultimately the show will come down to more human based terror than magic enduced. I think it's going to boil down to betrayal and stuff.

But for shits and giggles any thoughts on this..Could the 3ER have actually sent out the NK to do his bidding and then ultimately the NK got power hungry and decided, fuck you I'm going to take over this place.

What if the 3ER wanted them to kill Jon. In the books and the show the lead guy if those rangers in the opener of the pilot resembles Jon Snow. Some people have suggested the WW were trying to kill Jon but, in the words of Shaggy, it wasn't him.

Maybe the purpose of showing Bran the truth about Jon Snow was to try and eventually lead him to discover Jon had to die for some reason.

So what if originally the 3ER sent out (or warged) the slave of the NK to take out Jon Snow, like his version of Faceless Men. But he had just seen a vision of Jon so maybe wasn't totally sure when he'd be heading to the wall. 

What if of all Crastors children the 1 we see the NK turn in the show was the only one he did that to, to give himself an heir. And what if all the other children had been taken as blood sacrifices to the 3ER, when Bran is in there you can see skulls on the floor.

What if the NK realised how powerful he was by himself and decided to turn on the 3ER? What if that was why he killed the 3ER? 

What if originally they made a pact to ""defeat the WW"" but the pact was actually made made with the 3ER and not the NK (not sure if my timeline matches on that) ?

And what if the NK has nothing to do with prophecy and all that but that he just wants the Throne, he has an heir ready?

But why would the 3ER want Jon dead originally? I don't know, isn't the 3ER a Blackfyre? But as we've seen now, the NK doesn't even really care about Jon. He's an inconvenience but the NK could have killed him by now but I just don't think he sees him as any threat to the throne...

[Spoilers] Who is the Night King?,"3 theories on who the Night King is:
1-Bran. I don’t like this theory. It’s mainly based on the fact that Bran and the NK have the same fashion consultant. And Bran has become a bit of a cold fish since he went all three-eyed. Bran is just acting like any other social media addict who gets all detached and spaced out about the real world. I think he’s the same Bran, son of Ned Stark and noble knight wannabe. I do  think Bran will end up time travel warging into some poor kid 8000 years in the past and become “Bran the Builder”, but that’s another theory. 

2-Some yet unknown Stark in the past, maybe the first Stark. This theory is supported by the fact that Starks have warging and Greensight in their blood, and that (on steroids) is the skill set that allows the NK to do what he does. Problem with this is they only have 6 episodes left to create the NKs back story and give us a reason to care about it.

3- New theory ( unless someone has already posted this) : the Night King is the Mad King. I was just thinking, “who is nasty enough and bat-shit crazy enough to want to kill the whole world and turn them into zombies?” Then I remembered Bran having visions of the mad king yelling “burn them all!”.  That has to mean something. What if just before Jaime stuck a knife in his back Bran somehow ( from the future) managed to thrust the Mad King 8000 years back and stuff him into whoever in flesh became the Night King.  Maybe Bran will try to find out the NKs story to try to stop him, but will also be traveling to the MKs time to figure out where they hid the wildfire. Or whatever. The idea is that Bran can be a conduit throughout the history of Westeros. 

The Mad King becoming the Night King would truly be a story of fire and ice. The Mad King always hated the Starks, and wanted to have a dragon. And it would be be fitting if Dany, who always had to live with the legacy of her whack job dad, finally takes him out in the end.

Any thoughts or theories?

[SPOILERS] Could Dragonstone Erupt &amp; Fulfill Prophecy?,"I've been thinking about S8 and what kind of cinematic spectacles they could bring to bear, and I started thinking about geological catastrophes and the Doom of Valyria and volcanoes, and when perusing the map I saw something which made me sit up a bit.

Now think back to what Mirri Maz Duur said: ""When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before."" I've read a lot about what some folks seem to think about this, but I saw something interesting on the map.

God's Eye and Dragonstone are in a nearly perfect east-west alignment. I started to think about what someone would see if they were, say, at The Isle of Faces and Dragonstone erupted. Would they think about suns setting in the east?

Or alternately, if someone was on Dragonstone and something (dunno what) happened at The Isle of Faces could that be like a sun rising in the west?

And I suppose that with enough of a geological catastrophe, one could raise some land far enough to cause the seas to run dry. The Arm of Dorne is said to be the remnants of a land bridge destroyed by the Children of the Forest. If they can do that, could they raise the land beneath the Narrow Sea? I've seen some folks speculate that the Night King could freeze the water as well, although that doesn't really appeal to me too much.

And, of course, an erupting volcano could destroy itself with enough force to end up 'blowing in the wind like leaves.' One could make the argument that the snow-like covering in Dany's House of Undying vision is actually volcanic ash. Yeah, that's snow sticking in her hair, but it could also be snowing onto ash already in place.

But mainly I was struck with the alignment of The Isle of Faces with Dragonstone and the idea that since the first pact was signed at God's Eye, that this location could feature prominently in this next season—and Dragonstone with its volcano is exactly due east from there. And there's a prophecy concerning Dany which mentions East, West, and mountains being destroyed. Not to mention that many folks think she is pregnant. And that she is (probably) the last Targaryen and the first Targaryen conqueror set out from Dragonstone.

Not sure it qualifies as a theory, but it did seem very interesting to me. And in fairness it doesn't seem any more of a reach than some other speculations about that particular prophecy. I mean, there's clearly a lot of substance to the idea that things on this scale have happened in the past. And I do think they're gonna want to raise the bar in terms of visual spectacle, and if GoT is really (as some insist) an ecological horror story, how better to punctuate that than with a geological catastrophe?

(Spoilers) Bran and his wogging,"I noticed that in one scene when bran is wogging into ravens, it shows the ravens eyes going white which clearly indicates he is wogging into them. In the last season of season 7, bran is shown wogging but imo it’s not really clear if he is going into the ravens or something else. I’m not saying I believe the bran as the knight king thing but I do remember the three eyed raven saying that if you stay in a vision for too long you may never come back and bran went as far as being touched in a vision and even noticed in another by the knight king when he is watching the army in ravens. I feel like it could be possible for bran to maybe be trapped in the knight kings body after maybe trying to wog into him and change things in the first flashback bran saw him in and bran trying to wog into the night king is maybe what got him noticed and trapped",gameofthrones,True,1534949312,2018-08-22

[SPOILERS] Thoughts on Podrick,"Podrick is in my opinion one of the more underrated characters on Game of Thrones. I mean he seems to have a good heart and wants to do the right thing but everyone here seems to think he will die, Now yes that is understandable as S7 showed that he needs to get alittle better at his fighting skills but still though I don't think Podrick will die (atleast I don't want him too, even though I am 50/50 on weather or not he will/should die), But in my opinion I think there is two things I want to see from Podrick (and before he possibly dies which I don't think/want to happen) and that is we need to learn what he did to those prostitutes, and he needs his own heroic moment where he does something that shows not only has his training paid off but also something that will make viewers and the people of Westeros remember him look after the story is over.

I'm not saying he has to kill the Night King or anything or be the one to kill The Mountain or something (even though that would be cool) but I mean maybe he does something that could risk his own life in order to save somebody else or a group of people, Like maybe he risk his own life saving Sansa from a White Walker and/or a group of Wights or maybe he sacrifices himself saving Brienne from a White Walker or the Mountain or something like that, Heck maybe Arya could teach him a thing or two about water dancing (which is how I think she beat Brienne in the sparing last season, I think that Arya still remembers her classes with Syrio and I think she may have also improved her skills on the way back home from brravos) and maybe then Podrick will become a better fighter and may do something heroic to be remember for and not just being remember for his uncle Illyn.

Also if Podrick lives to the end I still think it be pretty cool if he ended up marrying Sansa and took the last name of Stark.",gameofthrones,True,1534952518,2018-08-22

[Spoilers]Sansa's future....," 

This is more of a book theory - but with some minor rewriting could still happen in the show.

​

And I apologize if this is posted elsewhere on here, haven't seen it.

​

Redheads are kissed by fire.

This  is a statement oft-repeated throughout the books. It seems innocuous,  but since when are repeated details like this innocuous? Could be…. But  not sure it is. Words have meaning in ASOIAF… Winter is coming (the  threat of the NK and the WWs). Ours is the fury (perfectly descriptive  of House Baratheon). Blood and fire (Dany born through blood (natural  birth) and born through fire (when the dragons hatched and she found her  strength)) (Jon born through blood (natural birth) reborn through fire  (Melisandre)). The Lannisters always pay their debts (and so they have)  (and yes, I know those are not their house words, which is why I listed  it.) I am the king (those kings who have said that have proven  themselves unworthy and been killed.)

Anyway…. So words have meanings. And redheads are kissed by fire.

Sansa  is a redhead… my theory goes that Sansa will die – possibly by  Littlefinger in the books and  will be revived by Lady Stoneheart via the last kiss.  OR  killed by someone else on the show and revived by Beric Dondarrion or Melisandre on the show....

*A Storm of Swords*

*Thoros  of Myr explains to Arya Stark that he administered the last kiss to  Lord Beric Dondarrion whenBeric died after the battle at the Mummer's  Ford. The kiss revived Beric, however, much to the shock of Thoros, who  had never seen such an occurrence before and attributes the resurrection  to R'hllor.*

*A Feast for Crows*

*Thoros  tells Brienne of Tarth that when the brotherhood without banners found  the long-dead body of Catelyn Stark, he refused to perform the kiss of  life on her. Beric instead touched his lips to Catelyn's, passing the  flame of life from him to her.*

A kiss “powered by” R’hllor… which passed the flame of life… a kiss by fire.  It just seems too prominent and repeated a saying to be irrelevant.

[SPOILERS] What Varys was told...,"I'm not sure if this is out there but it seems to click for me... 

Varys had his parts tossed in the flame and heard a voice. 

It was then repeated to him by Kinvara who knows what was said as well and it horrifies him.

Mel also said he will die in Westeros, so this might tie into what was said, possibly a horrific prophecy, which could lead to a death in Westeros.  

Dany has threatened to burn him and his relationship with her has been strained. 

So, I think the prophecy was something along the lines of: **the rest of you will burn just as these parts have one day.** Since part of him was burning at the time I think he was told the rest will join it in the end. R'hllor is a fire god after all. 

I don't know if he understood it or what he was told at the time, he might not get the language. Maybe Kinvara translated it to him when she whispered it to him. If he knows his destiny is to burn...I wonder what he would think of the dragons and Dany's threat to burn him? Also, there is wildfire under the keep so he may get it in an unexpected way.

It is heavily implied, both in that scene and in a conversation between Loras and Renly, that she is not only not a virgin, but has a vibrant sexual appetite. Margaery suggests involving Loras when she's with Renly to try and get him going, and speaks to the High Sparrow about ""the desires that used to drive [her]."" She can also be seen briefly checking out several other characters throughout the show, including Olyvar in the scene where she walks in on him and Loras, and a woman in robes in the linked scene with Sansa, moments after mentioning ""pretty girls"" as a potential interest. Was she bisexual? Would she be considered a polyamorous type, in the right context? What do you think?

[SPOILER] Season 8 character death theory,"I was rewatching Season 7 last night with my girlfriend who has never seen the series before and I put together two interesting pieces of dialogue. 

Firstly, when Lady Melisandre tells Varys that he is going to die. I’m sure everybody immediately assumed that was going to happen. However, it is awfully close to when Daenerys tells Varys that if he ever betrays her, she’ll kill him. 

I think that Daenerys will kill Varys towards the end of Season 8. Most likely for doing something she told him not to do but he did anyway for the realm. This could also explain the recent stuff coming from Emilia Clarke saying that Daenerys has a bit of a messy ending to Season 8 and she hopes it doesn’t ruin her character.

2. The First men hide those things.

3. Dragon glass is known to destroy white walkers

4. What is the horn is supposed to do?

Any thoughts? My thoughts: I think the right king wants the horn. It could be that when the others were defeated, the night king was punished to go north and stay there for a 1000 years (exiled) and when he serves his terms he can come back and find dragon glass to return to life, use the horn to give life to his soldiers (the dead) by blowing into it.

""A house standing strong"" describes the Starks, Jon's family. ""Holding the line"" describes Jon's job on the wall, they protect Westeros against wildlings and other creatures behind the wall.

\[Pre-Chorus\]  
""Leave behind your heart and cast away"" Jon Snow needs to leave Winterfell and his family, to become one of the Night's Watch at the wall.

\[Chorus\]  
Jon Snow is a natural at being one of the Night's Watch, he's really good at fighting and courageous. He has to be cold sometimes while making decisions.

\[Verse 2\]  
""The light between the trees shadowing"" might be the landscape behind the wall, but this is possibly the weakest verse qua references.

\[Bridge\]  
""Taking an oath"" might be another reference to the Night's Watch. ""The end is upon us"" can be a reference to the white walkers that come back in the winter.

[spoilers] Prediction how Cersei will die (if she dies) in season 8,"DnD (and GRRM) like to make metaphors/idioms literal at either when characters die or a turning point in their arc.  A few examples are;

Arya was at the crossroads when she decided to go to Winterfell instead of King’s Landing

Jaime overplayed his hand - he tried to get himself untied after saving Brienne from being raped.

Arya was blinded by revenge killing Trant.  An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.

Sansa took the leap (from Winterfell wall) and faced her fears

Lysa was standing on the edge (batshit crazy)

Cat was negotiating (for Robb’s life) with cutthroats

Theon was cocky

Oberyn needed eyes in the back of his head.

Jon was lured out in the open by olly olly oxen free

Margaery was playing with fire (games with Cersei) and got burnt

Renly’s death was all smoke and mirrors (he was standing in front of a mirror when the black smoke/shadow arrived) to cover that Stannis had killed him.

Stannis cast a long shadow, which led Brienne to kill him later.

 

I am pretty sure given the Mountain has a temper that his “blood will boil”. Also given Qyburn replaced his blood with some weird substance, my guess is the hound will put him on fire and he will burn from the inside out. So boiling liquid will come from his eyes.

Now as for Cersei; we know she has become “her own worst enemy” and caused her children harm with her plans. Now she will cause herself harm through one of her plans. Her plan will literally backfire. Now she could get burnt trying to burn others, but that isn’t a literal backfire unless she is running and her back catches on fire. But that doesn’t really follow DnDs pattern because it is literal words. Also it doesn’t follow her prophecy of the valonqar, but it doesn’t need to since it was left out of the show. I think that kind of death is rather non eventful to get burnt.

I believe she tries to use one of the ballistas. She was taught how to pull the lever. Most likely she has one set up in the dragonpit. At this stage Gregor is dead and she is desperate and tries to shoot Drogon and Dany (who is in the sky fighting Viserion). As she is about to pull the lever, Jaime tries to stop her by hitting the ballista tension with his sword. This causes the ballista to break and pieces fly off. Jaime ducks and when he turns he sees Cersei on the ground with a large piece of the ballista in her. It caused a backfire. She is bleeding out and losing a lot of blood. At this stage Jaime does a mercy kill and places his hands around her pale white neck (very white due to blood loss) and chokes the life from her.

But it doesn’t end there. Jaime failed to stop the arrow from firing and it hits Rhaegal causing him to fall. He smashes the throne room with his tail going down and lands in the dragonpit. Because the NK is close, he reanimates and Jaime and Brienne now have to fight wight Rhaegal. After a battle they both manage to stick their swords into the dragon which kills him and both of their swords ignite with blue flame (Rhaegal now being like Viserion). This also aligns with Jaime’s dream in the books. They continue to fight wights but Jaime is badly injured from Rhaegal. They manage to escape but Jaime is badly wounded and collapses. Brienne holds him as he dies. So Jaime dies as a result of Cersei’s actions and fulfills Olenna’s prophecy that Cersei will be the end of him. They manage to kill each other.",gameofthrones,True,1535036490,2018-08-23

Ok, I’m new to this and this is my first post, but here it goes. 

I was thinking today about Ned and his admission of guilt. What effect did his admission in front of the small folk have, if any?

Considering the mistreatment of lords by a king would break the feudal agreement that they all live under. So let’s say when Rickard and Brandon were killed this was seen as unjust amongst  the lords and would therefore impact their decision to join the rebel’s cause. 

So basically does anyone think that if Ned would not have admitted to treason would more lords have sided with Robb? And also would any of them been more reluctant to join the crown?",gameofthrones,True,1535042333,2018-08-23

My question is: Do we know Cersei's direct orders about what exactly Sandor is supposed to do with Mycah? Is he explicitly ordered to kill him, which seems to be what most people think and leads people to respond with ""Nuremburg""? Or was he just ordered to bring him back?

If the second -- given that he knows exactly what kind of sadistic torture Mycah would be in for from his employers, could killing him during the hunt be a form of the gift of mercy?

[Leaks] Brief overview of season 8,"I am a cleaner at a studio, where season 8 was being filmed. One of the producers left out an early copy of the plotline, take with a pinch of salt.

Beric and Tormund managed to get inland enough on top of the wall to avoid being killed. Somehow get down from the wall and lead a small party of survivors behind lines attempting to reach the Castle Black to send ravens out that the wall has been breached.  

Jump to Winterfell where the rest of them have travelled up to from White Harbor after sailing there (end of season 7). Both dragons also there. Tyrion and Sansa reunite, Jon and Arya, Jon and Sam. 

Jaime arrives at Winterfell, greeted warmly by Tyrion, with suspicion by the rest especially Dany. Explains about Cersei not actually sending men. Should be expressed like Tyrion, he does not betray Cersei completely and does not notify anyone of the Golden Company and Euron.
Short skirmish at Last Hearth, taken and army presses on to secure the rest of the wall. 

Bran summons Jon under the Weirwood tree and tells him his true ancestry, flashback to Ned and boatsex etc. Jon is unsure how he feels.
After the death of Littlefinger, Sansa ensures the Vale's leadership with Lord Royce as Robin is not old or competent enough although he will not pledge for Dany yet. 

Pressing Cersei to acknowledge the threat, Qyburn searches for places to mine dragonglass as a precaution, putting their past differences aside, he works with the maesters who have now also acknowledged the threat and send ravens to every corner of Westeros detailing the situation.

Many of the seven kingdoms in the grip of Cersei or in dissaray, no further armies are sent north at all.
In Winterfell, the lords argue about what to do, now all realising the threat and the fall of the wall which has now been taken entirely, Tormund and Beric along with all Night's Watch presumed dead. In the great hall, Dany and Jon are heckled by the Northern lords for their alliance, many saying that the King in the North should not be pledged to her. Bran announces to everyone Jon's true parentage, Sam confirms that he is not a bastard but the rightful heir to the seven kingdoms. Causes uproar, Dany is vocal and feels her claim is threatened, Jon is outed at King in the North. Sansa becomes Queen in the North and pledges to Dany.

Tyrion attempts to bring order and says that they need to plan their defence. Being the most military-minded Jaime, Jorah and Jon agree to split the forces in the North to defend in specific strongholds. 
Jaime orders all remaining forces around the Last Hearth to retreat to The Dreadfort, where he would garrison a few thousand men. Accompanied by Brienne, Podrick and Arya.

Jorah would garrison another force of a few thousand to Deepwood Motte and the Wolfswood. Accompanied by the Hound. Jon would stay in Winterfell with around 10,000 men. The remainder of the North's forces would be spread out south in places such as White Harbor to prepare for a retreat. The Vale's forces in the North would stay in Winterfell also as a response force, ready to ride out to wherever they were needed to prevent a breach in the defensive line. Dany travels to Dragonstone to oversee mining of dragonglass, leaving Varys and Tyrion in Winterfell. 

Cersei secures Dorne now that they are leaderless with the newly acquired Golden Company, shoring up her empire to 6 of the 7 kingdoms. She is more upset than angry that Jaime left her, and without his command of the armies she is worried about their performance - she is running out of competent people to trust.

Dothraki and Unsullied that were putting King's Landing under seige and repelled by the rest of the Lannister army from behind as they do not have the discipline to efficiently scout or come up with proper tactics. Grey Worm is killed in the fighting with the entire Unsullied forces. Having a means to, many Dothraki escape and attempt to ride north to meet with Dany.

Dany, tied up north cannot spare anymore forces to send south and help the Unsullied, hence their destruction. She enters a state of rage on Dragonstone hearing of the news, and with her remaining two dragons flies to King's Landing against the counsel of Tyrion and Jon in season 7 and lets forth her fire. Qyburn's scorpions are not numerous enough to land any hits and therefore much of King's Landing is burnt to the ground. Red Keep in tact and Eurons fleet was absent still sailing back from Dorne. Cersei uses this to her advantage and makes claims about Targaryen madness. Upon hearing the news, Tyrion and Varys are visibly hurt with even Jon showing signs of regret about her leadership. Deepwood Motte falls now exposing the left flank of the North, remaining garrison flee. Jorah injured.

Karhold and its tiny force falls as most had been called by Jaime.
The Dreadfort holds out in siege. Arya kills her first White Walker with her valyrian steel dagger in a raiding party outside the keep. Theory from season 7 about undead dying if their walker is proven correct again. Podrick dies after saving Brienne from being overwhelmed. Theon reaches the Iron Islands. Iron Islanders rally behind him and with newly acquired dragonglass raid the shore protecting Jorah's rear and preventing him from being overwhelmed as he retreats to Winterfell.

Dreadfort falls, all retreat to Winterfell. 
Dany returns from King's Landing to Winterfell with both dragons, met with anger from Jon and absolute hostility from Tyrion and Varys. Northern lords threaten her. Dany refuses to back down and makes a point that she would do it again.
Jorah's force reaches Winterfell with Jaime's short afterwards. 

Wight dragon appears first and is met by Dany and Jon riding Drogon and Rhaegal, lance from the Night King pierces Dany's heart, killing her and enraging her dragons. Together they disable but the Night King manages to attack Winterfell fast enough so that Jon cannot get to Visieron with dragonglass. Morale of forces is shaken and they do not hold out long against the undead.
A large army from the Vale appears with the young Robin at the request of Sansa and Royce to relieve the siege. With a final push everyone inside Winterfell push out and meet up with the Vale's forces. Winterfell is destroyed. Bran insists on being left under the Weirwood tree. Similarly to the cave with the children, none of the undead can get close and even the Night King cannot touch him. Bran explains that he can send telepathic messages to Jon etc when he needs because of the power coming from the Weirwood. 

Jon and Jaime set up splinter forces to attempt to attack the commanders while the Vale and remainder of the garrison fight. 
One force will attack from the left flank consisting of Jorah, the Hound, Arya and Brienne. The right flank consists of Jaime, Jon, and a newly joined Bronn with a small partisan force of around 100 Lannisters in a classic GOT deus ex machina.
Jaime kills a walker with his valyrian steel sword taking out a portion of the undead. Jorah and Brienne both kill walkers but it does not have enough of an effect and they all retreat, much of the Vale's forces holding up in and around the Eyrie with Davos accompanying them as a sort of ambassador to Sansa.

Dany is resurrected by the Night King and takes his place on Visieron. 
The remainder of the North also seek refuge in the Vale, using the harsh mountains to their advantage. 
The dead now march south to the Riverlands, where Cersei's armies meet them for the first time. Unprepared and unwilling, frontlines are smashed by the dead and the Dothraki hordes from the south. Dany's greatest asset was about to be added to the Night King's army as the Dothraki, without dragonglass tried to fight through the undead. This obviously ended in complete failure and the only remaining Dothraki are now those on Dragonstone with Missandei. 

The undead take significant losses as they push south, recovering in Lannister dead. 
Cersei refuses to flee to Highgarden as the dead attack King's Landing. 
North and Vale push out from the Vale into the rearguard of the dead hoping to end the war by ambushing the Night King. 
Fight to King's Landing, meet up with Lannister forces. Cersei holding up in Red Keep. Jaime, Bronn, Brienne and the Hound with a few hundred soldiers with Tyrion and Varys fight up to get in. Cersei is found cowering on the Iron Throne with the Mountain which the Hound squares up to. The Mountain kills the Hound, being killed after by Brienne and Bronn. Jaime realises Cersei's madness and paralleled to Aerys he kills her with a sword in her back, also revealing that she was never pregnant. 

Melisandre sails to Dragonstone and gets a boat with Davos to King's Landing where uses the her powers to bless or enchant the scorpion bolt, allowing the dany to be killed, as she is still resistant to fire after being resurrected. Visieron is disabled by Jon riding Rhaegal and Drogon is used extensively to batter down the undead. After taking the Red Keep, the Lannister armies rally behind Tyrion and Jaime and manage to take out a large portion of the undead, with raids from Jorah and Jon killing some of the commanders. The Night King makes a fatal error and succumbs to his anger and rides a now recovered Visieron directly into the red keep, and as per her prophecy Melisandre dies along with Varys at the hands of the Night King himself in the chaos. The Night King links up with a substantial force of undead and pushes further into the keep. Bran connects with Jon to help with strategy as he has now exceeded by far the old 3er's powers. Bran is using the Weirwood tree to interfere with the Night King and his commanders, similar to how a dog dislikes high frequencies. This throws the Night King off balance and a now dissolved undead force allows Arya to use her valyrian steel dagger to slowly kill the commanders one by one. 

She stabs the Night King in the heart and he shatters. 
The undead immediately fall to bones and blow away like dust in the wind. 
Being next in line to the throne, King Jaime of House Lannister's first commands are for the two remaining dragons to vapourise the Iron Throne. 

The Queen in the North, Jon, Tyrion, Jaime and most of the other lords agree that the monarchy should be abolished, and the Crownlands become the possession of Aegon Targaryen. 
Each of the kingdoms become totally independent, Aegon (Jon) King of the Crownlands, Sansa as Queen of the North, Robin as King of the Vale, a restored Edmure and his son King of the Riverlands, Jaime and Tyrion jointly rule the Westerlands, Samwell Tarly King of the Reach, A recovered Yara rules the Iron Islands after Euron's death at King's Landing, Gendry, Robert's bastard is legitimised and becomes King of the Stormlands and Dorne elects to rule in a committee.

[SPOILERS] Some dark foreshadowing in S7E5 Eastwatch,"I was rewatching ""Eastwatch"" episode and saw some dark foreshadowing that I missed the first time. Not sure if this has been posted before, I guess it's pretty obvious foreshadow.


In the Citadel scene when the maesters are reading Wolkin's (wokest) warning, the closing comments and their proximity to Jon's true name (Aegon) being revealed just 2 episodes later seem to foreshadow that Euron will be the one to kill Jon Snow.

Ah Lodock... RIP Jon.

Dany had the opportunity to seized the throne, by fighting Cersei, but decided to go North instead, to help Jon fight the Night King.

[SPOILERS] Why a certain shipping will not happen,"So I think it is safe to say after S7 Jon/Daenerys will be the romance of canon, I know the books have not come out yet but I think there is enough forshadowing in the books for a Jon and Daenerys romance as well to the point where I think it will be both a book and show thing. However some people still believe another shipping will happen....that shipping is JONSA aka Jon/Sansa so today I am going to explain why Jon/Sansa will not happen in the story and will NOT be endgame in the show or books, let's begin.

Okay so the first big thing is that Jon and Sansa were raised believing they were brother and sister meaning that there marriage would be pretty weird and awkward, Not to mention I don't think Jon will want to marry someone he believed to be his sister for years. Another thing is that the people who ship this pairing claim it would parallel Ned and Catelyn but first of all Ned and Cat were never raised believing they were Brother and Sister and secondly not everything has to parallel each other exactly, The scene where Jon strangles LF in S7 I think was just simply a coincidence that it was similar to Ned strangling LF in S1 and also I think that not only meant to show that Jon does not care what LF thinks but also that if it was out of love it was non-incestuous family love, as in he was just trying to protect his sister.

Also it does not fit with the idea of a Song of Ice and Fire or a Stark/Targaryen alliance as Jon is still somewhat a Stark. Jon and Sansa have been through a lot and have survived but so has Daenerys and pretty much most of the characters in the story for that matter. Also you could argue the scenes in S6 between Jon and Sansa may have set this up but I don't think that was the intention also yes Jon left to fight Ramsey and take back WF because of Sansa but it was not out of romantic love but family love, Finally I don't think D&amp;D were ever going to have Jon and Sansa be a thing, if they were going to (or at the very least have a love triangle between Jon, Sansa, and Daenerys) they would've been a lot more forshadowing and set up for it very early on in S7 and also through out S7 like idk maybe in one of the scenes between Jon and Sansa before the scene ends Sansa look longingly into Jon's eyes or something and also maybe when LF mentions Jon and Dany being young and single he could also bring up to Sansa she is young and single as well. But they didn't do any thing like that which leads me to believe it is not the intention.

Now yes I will admit I use to be a Jonsa shipper myself, However I quickly retired from it after S7 because I knew it was a lost cost as it was not where the story was going. Also looking back on it the shipping itself was just silly, Like why would Jon marry a woman he saw as his sister all his life (which is the same reason why I don't support the Jon/Arya shipping as well). As for the books, Well if Sansa marries a Targaryen in the books it's probably going to be Young Griff/Aegon but that's my personal opinion.",gameofthrones,True,1535214526,2018-08-25

But the perpetrator was technically Joffrey Baratheon, son of Robert per the crown records. Although Robb knew the true lineage and his beef was against the Lannisters, what ever happened to Robert’s army if he had one. I mean, Stannis and Renly had an army, and Renly amassed a huge one like in no time. So where the heck was Robert’s when all this shit went down. I mean the king of the Iron Throne surely must have had a fighting force loyal to Robert, right?",gameofthrones,True,1535228104,2018-08-25

"[SPOILERS] Jon and Dany as foils, not really parallels!!!","I know that many people here talks about how Jon Snow and Daenerys story work in parallel to each other and how they are destined to be with each other, but I want to discuss how they work better as foil to each other. Lets go shall we??

* Daenerys never had a home and a family, but she had a name, a very important name that brought her some good things and some bad things, but her life was pretty much defined by that name; Jon Snow in the other hand, never had a name but he did had a home and a family that loved him dearly and the relationship he formed in that family and the values his Stark father passed to him did shape him to be the man he is today defining him in the same way that Daenerys's name defined her. 

* One was defined by their family name; the other by their family actions. 

* in season 1 Jon Snow joined the Night Watch, where he learned how to serve, he was literally cleaning toilets; Dany was made Queen in season 1, she had servants and maids and was learning how to give orders;

* Jon Snow was named Lord Commader and KITN, power is giving to him by his peers and Lords of the North, he never seeks power, yet they keep on giving to him; Daenerys seeks power during her all journey in the books, and she uses her dragons to achieve this power. She conquers cities and forces the Masters of Meereen to proclaim her as their queen.

* One is leading his people to safety, Jon brought the Wildlings south od the Wall to save them from the NK;  Daenerys  is dragging her people over the ocean so that she can be a queen. The dothraki and Unsulied are now less safe because of Daenerys decision to bring them to Westeros.

* One is using her followers for a personal goal, the other is leading his followers to save their lives. (huuuuuu)

* One never ask people to bend their knees to him; the other will burn you alive if you refuse do it. 

* One always believed to be a bastard, with no name and believes to not be entitled to anything; the other can not stop saying her stupid name and believes to be entitled to all 7 kingdoms (oooops!!!!). 

* One is humble; the other is very arrogant. 

* Jon Snow words that guide him through this story are  **""I am the shild that guards the realms of men""** ; Daenerys words she keeps on repeating over and over is **""I take whats is mine with fire and blood""**.

They could not be more different from each other actually, which was what D&amp;D tried to tells us in the scene where they first meet. Daenerys repeated her stupid list of names, while Jon simply presented himself as KITN. Which is why we will have a second Dance of Dragons in season 8.

Cersei's death will be caused by the child she is currently pregnant with.  Reading through ice and fire wiki has tommen as the potential valonquar as he qualifies as the younger brother if it relates to her children.  Tommen would be a whight according to the theory but i just haven't been able to shake the feeling that her baby will be the one that causes her death.

I’m sure it’s just because at this moment Cersei is thinking about the fact that Sansa will be responsible for taking care of Cersei’s grandchildren but it definitely makes me hope they have some sort of stand-off/reunion in the final season.

[Spoilers] To me it's a shame about littlefinger...,"I'm so surprised how things ended up for him. He was incredibly cunning and I was so sure it'd be him, Dany(with Varys's backing), Jon and Cersei vying for the throne in the final season. I liked the subtle plays for power by each character and how it varied along a spectrum. From completely overt(Dany) to covert (LF and Varys) to a combination of the two in Cersei and a new dimension of just knowing nothing and it being thrust upon him. Of the four candidates for the throne, LF never got a chance to overtly use his full strength in service of his purpose, and that's a damn shame. I imagined he'd have an army and stronghold while still playing the game and bringing disorder to the plans of his foes. For some reason he stayed in the shadows, wasting a lifetime of maneuvering up the ladder from the chaos he inflicted. As if he were to throw away a life aspiration to chase a Cat lookalike and being a pheux-warden of the north, as if that was a substitution or step toward being the ruler of the seven kingdoms. Varys said LF was one of the most dangerous men in the seven kingdoms but that never truly came into fruition. In an alternative universe where LF had his amry at his back and used the full capability of his cunning and strength to be a true antagonist only falling short to the NK, I imagine a much different, and maybe more interesting story playing out.

will cersei go north to fight the undead?," 

hey folks, this is just what i think might happen in the show in season 8.

​

cersei might go north to fight the undead army after winterfell has fallen.

​

probably the final stand could be in the eyrie.

​

remember that littlefinger and sansa murdered lysa arryn, the mother of robyn.

​

cersei might use this knowledge to turn robyn against sansa, and this might turn robyn to pledge alliance to cersei.

​

i think that by the time northern army and dany's armies reach eyrie, cersei might already be there.

​

they could probably make warplans together- jon,cersei,jaime,dany,tyrion,sansa,etc all sitting in one wartable and discussing warplans. probably these scenes could be awesome.

such scenes would make more awesome than the warscenes itself.

​

i think that the combined armies of cersei,jon and dany might defeat the undead army.

​

i think after the battle is over by episode 4, then the game of thrones begins.

expect betrayal from tyrion in this regard.

probably euron might be the final villain in game of thrones.

​

in the books, euron is portrayed as a terrifying darklord who is seeking bloodsacrifice to conjure up his mythical ironborn diety.

probably euron might use the wildfire to blow up kingslanding to perform his massive bloodsacrifice.

​

what do you think??

The Greatest warrior in The GAME OF THRONES,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1535296698,2018-08-26
[SPOILER] The greatest warriors of the GAME OF THRONES,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1535297300,2018-08-26
[SPOILERS] The greatest warriors in the GAME OF THRONES,"Well I was wondering who was a better warrior **Ser Barriston ""the bold"" Selmy** or **Ser Arthur Dayne(the sword of the morning)**.
To be very honest, we only saw both of the battle in only one scene. And we have heard a lot about them from Brandon Stark (who was told by his father Eddard Stark), and from Jorah Mormont (about Ser Barriston).
Well in my opinion the fight between Ser Arthur and Ned and his companions was far better. I guess this is because worriers in Ned's team were quite better than those of Son's of Harpy. Well Son's of Harpy also by very large in number and there was only Gray worm and Ser Barriston fighting. *And in my opinion the biggest factor was old age*.

Of course these are not the only one who are great fighter. The most insane one is well everyone know **Ser Gregor""the mountain"" Clegane**. The one who won one of the best fight in GoT(Well the red viper was of course silly but anyway). Ser Gregor is maybe the only one who can behead someone completely barehanded (I am not talking about Oberyn Martell, I am talking about that stupid faith militant). He is clearly the most in-human character. 

Now The mountain's brother, **Ser Sandor ""the Hound"" Clegane**. He is very much human in comparison to his brother, but only in the second half of GoT. Over the period he is one of the most changed person. Now on his fighting skills, in these 7 seasons we get to know that he is quite good at killing. Only get defeated once by the Lady. In first season we see him in a single combat with is brother and they looked equally powerful. 

Now next should be the Lady. Yaas I mean **Lady Brienne of Tarth**. Needs no introduction. I would only say that she defeated The Hound and Ser Loras Tyrell(who defeated the Mountain) in single combats. Well got defeated profoundly by Arya but still she **The** strongest woman in Westeros. 

Now next is **Ser Jaime ""The kingslayer""  Lannister**. *(with both hands of course)* Well he is the most changed person over the period. From throwing Bran to saving Brienne, we have seen him evolve over the period as a person. Anyways he is very good with the sword in his hand and he was named lord commander of kingsguard for that reason. We got to see him fight against Ned Stark which was one of the best fight in all 7 seasons. He is a very skilled commander at war as well. 

I have to mention him although I don't think he could even make to top 20 in books but in GoT **Ser Loras ""Knight of the flowers"" Tyrell** is the only one to defeat The Mountain and make it out alive. 

The man who we probably saw fight most in all seasons is **Ser Jorah Mormont** from killing Khal Drogo's blood rider to saving Dany multiple times. He is probably not the best but he had made this far which is as we all know not easy at all. 

Now well no one can forget this man **Lord Eddard Stark**. We mostly heard talking about his honarable character. We saw him fight only once in season 1 and then against sword of the morning. I wanted to see him fight more but anyways moving on. 

Now **Prince Oberyn ""Red Viper of Dorne Martell**, as Cersie said ""I haven't seem anyone use that spear like him, he almost defeated Ser Gregor"" but the most childish mistake in all 7 seasons and he is dead now so end of discussion on his part. 

The free folk **Tormund Giantsbane** only thing I want to say on his part is his own words ""I am good at killing"" when Sandor asked him ""how a man like you made it this far"". 

Now another character who I did not expect would make it this far is **Ser Bronn of The Blackwater**. First defeated the Knight of Vale (whose name I don't remember). Then saved the Lannister brothers multiple times. He said it many times that he works only for gold but tbh i fell he is better than that. 

Now the most beloved character **Jon Snow** the white wolf or I might say **Aegon Targaryen** or may be **998th Lord commander of the Night's watch**. He is (almost sure) Azor Ahai or the prince who was promised. He is the one of the two alive who have killed a *White Walker*. If I am not wrong he has actually killed 2 white walkers already. And as Ramsey said ""I have heard you are probably the best swordsman ever walked"" 

Now my personal favourite character**Arya Stark**. *No One*. We have seen her defeating Lady Brienne and killing the Bravosi girl. Not to mention the doom of House Frey single handedly. I can bet that no one on her killing list will survive season 8. 

*Torgo Nudho*. **Grey Worm** as he said he is the bravest and deserving commander of *The Unsullied Army*. 

Another man from Essos. The man with a great swagger. **Darrio Naharis**. Proved his greatest in many battle specially when Ser Jorah , Grey worm and Darrio fought in Meereen.



Now there are few more people we have heard about but never actully see them fight(which is such a pity). So those worriers are:
1. **Robert Baratheon** the fat king.
2. **Khal Drogo**. I can't consider a weapon less fight which eventually lead to his undesirable end. 
3. **Serio Forel**. I added him here because no matter what he was defeated by Ser Meryn Trant and he was armless so I can't consider that fight as well. 






Now the greatest warrior list according to me :-

1. **Ser Arthur Dayne**
2. **Ser Barriston Selmy**
3. **Ser Gregor Clegane**
4. **Khal Drogo**
5. **Arya Stark**
6. **Lady Brienne of Tarth**
7. **Ser Sandor Clegane**
8. **Ser Jaime Lannister**
9. **Jon Snow**
10. **Oberyn Martell**

[SPOILERS] lannister vale alliance?," 

hey folks, i was thinking.

​

would cersei go to the eyrie with her amies after she learns that winterfell is destroyed??

​

there's robyn arryn there.

she could tell him how sansa and LF were involved in his mother's death.

​

i was thinking like this...

cersei along with her armies approach the eyrie and with the permission of the vale enter it.

​

cersei desperately wants to meet robyn but robyn is busy playing with bow and arrow.

except that none of his arrows reach the target even closely. remember his shooting skills in season 6?lol

then cersei comes forward, gently tocuhes his arms, balances his posture, and tada! the arrow hits the bulls eye.

​

this leaves a good impression on robyn arryn.

then they begin to have a conversation.

cunning cersei shifts the topic about his mother.. ( motherhood is the character arc of cersei as well).

then she tells him how his mommy died.

i know my imagination has run wild, i know right?

​

​

anyway what do you think about this??

is a lannister-vale alliance possible??

[SPOILERS] Throne Room redecoration,"One of the things that Joffrey did as king was to have the throne room redecorated and redesigned to reflect how he wanted to rule. He took down the copper looking leaves that wrapped around the columns and instead added spikes and torches as well as changed out the stain glass windows for something more intimidating. 

This is one of the smaller things that Joffery did in Season 2 that really bothered me, but most of all it just served to underscore how terrible Joffery was at diplomacy. Clearly, that was the point, but damn it all. The throne room set up (presumably by Robert Baratheon) to serve implicitly as a warm and welcoming place for its many visitors of which most were not enemies of, but servants and messengers. It helped take the edge off of meeting with people in high places and allowed for more productive talks with the people who were currently in it. Then Joffrey came along and was like, ""Nope, don't need that. I'm a big bad conqueror and I want people to know it."" It's doubtful he ever understood the importance of keeping the peace and holding the 7 kingdoms together, and this was just one of so many many signs that he was unfit for the job.

[SPOILERS] A small detail I noticed upon rewatching.,"While rewatching season 4 episode 5, I noticed a very small detail that could easily be overlooked. When Sansa enters the Eyrie for the first time and meets her aunt Lysa and Robin, Sansa and Robin have a conversation about their deceased family members. Robin mentions: ""They killed my father too, with poison"". At that exact moment you can see Lysa side-eying Littlefinger, giving us a small hint about the true circumstances of Jon Arryns murder. We know now that Littlefinger manipulated Lysa into poisoning Jon Arryn, and I thought it was very cool that the show gave us this (very) subtle clue beforehand.",gameofthrones,True,1535314597,2018-08-26

[SPOILERS] About Jojen Reed's vision.,"I think it was referencing to the Beyond the Wall episode. Hear me out. Jon is already at Castle Black at the end of Season 3. In Season 4, yes, he went to Craster's Keep, but he was never surrounded. At Hardhome, what scene where he was ever \*surrounded\* by the wights or White Walkers? ""Surrounded"" —be all around. Encircle. The only thing he was ever \*surrounded\* was the Battle of the Bastards, when the Boltons encircled them, and Beyond the Wall.

But what about the ""Climb"" episode? Yes, I know he was also referencing to the wildlings (at the time), because the next scene clearly showed it, but he was never encircled nor be all around, only with them walking &amp; climbing. If you just think about it, Jojen only ""has visions that matters... you,"" saying to Bran; it's all about Bran and how to defeat the Night King. And ""Surrounded by enemies"" was the event where the Night King got the dragon.   

Let's see all Jojen's visions:

1) Bran &amp; the three-eyed raven

2) Catelyn's death (""promise me, no more climbing"")

3) His death (I know he was talking about Karl Tanner, but it applies to his death too. Which is more important. Visions are not literal, only glimpses or brief, open to interpretation. He only said that to Karl to stall him because he was about to rape his sister, Meera. He did see the Night's Watch burning Craster's Keep.)

4) Craster's Keep burning (important information to persuade Bran not to meet with Jon, as this would make Jon stop Bran from going to the Three-Eyed Raven.

4) The Great Weirwood Tree

5) Hodor's death (""Even Meera &amp; Hodor, we're only here to guide you.)

6) The end (the flaming hand)

7) Robert's Rebellion (""My father never talked about the rebellion, but I saw that too."")

8) The storm when they were at The Gift/widmill (because it was the first time ever Bran wargs to Hodor)

These informations are all that matter. All important visions. Not some ""Jon Snow was surrounded by the wildlings."" And besides, the wildlings was never their enemies. The wights and White Walkers were. Jon even united the wildlings to fight with them, against the dead, and I'm sure Jojen knew this future event. I mean, he didn't even see Rickon's death, and that was the time Bran sent him to the Umbers. Because visions are always selective.",gameofthrones,True,1533941235,2018-08-10

[Spoilers] Fire and blood is an underrated episode.,"When i see people's listings for the best episodes of the show, this episode never breaks the top 10, I don't see why. Yes i know this show has some flawless episodes but this is probably my favourite with the Winds of Winter. That sheer moment when Eddard's head is on the floor the sounds stops, Arya is pulled out by Yoren, brilliant what a way to make the scene emotional, Catelyn's scene with Robb is brilliant when he is hitting the tree and Catelyn breaks his down, brilliant, Joffrey in this episode is so brutal, after Baelor this was really the start of his cruel reign, when he shows Sansa Ned's head is digusting. Robb's King in the North scene was incredible and one of the best in the entire series,Although Umber's laughing is a bit ridiculous, but his speech is great (not as good as Lyanna's though). Absolutely brilliant acting allround from Robb,Theon,Cat. Cat's scene with Jaime was like i've said before really good, You can see after Nikoli's comments that he has regretted what he said, Cat does it brilliant to hold it together while Jaime absolutely roasts her. I loved the way Cat ask Jaime what happened to Bran and he arrogantly admits, typical S1-3 Jaime. Another example of phenomenal acting on Charles Dance's side, i've seen a youtube video about how he commands respect, and this is the perfect example, standing as a sign of power and waiting for others to speak so he can think of the perfect response. Another example Tywin dosen't ask Tyrion to serve he tells him, he has to showing that Tywin will always win in these situations. Although I wasn't the biggest fan of Daenarys losing Rhaego and having to kill Drogo, Emilia still did a great job, i honestly don't understand how people consider her a bad actor. Jon is willing to risk his life to help Robb, that's just another example of the bond between the Stark family. Varys and Littlefinger's war of words. WOW there's nothing more satisfying then having two of the most powerful people of there professions battling, and this is what that is. Two Genius's going one on one. The beginning of the Arya and Gendry relationship, really liked this scene Hotpie is only acting like a dick, because with the situation your, the more people that fear you the better, Gendry standing up for Arya was great too, the beginning of the trio. Jon Snow finally becomes proud of his role as a member of the Night's Watch. He is proud to go beyond the wall. The final shot of this season is arguably my favourite moment of the entire series, Daenarys rising from the flames with the three dragons, incredible. The beginning of the end. I wasn't a big fan of season 1 but the two final episodes saved the season. This episode is really underrated.",gameofthrones,True,1533950220,2018-08-10

[SPOILERS] “Chaos is a ladder...,"many who try to climb fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. Some are given the chance to climb, they refuse. They cling to the realm, or the gods, or love, illusion. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.” 

In all honesty here, Littlefinger played the Game of Thrones better than anyone. Any character you can think of who was murdered, probably could have been prevented if Littlefinger never existed. 

Ned, Catlyn, Rickon, Robb, Tywin, etc.
Baelish betrayed ned and Catlyn
causing Rickon to go into hiding.
Which caused Robb to rebel, leading to his death. He helped poison Joffrey which got Tyrion framed, ultimately leading to Tywins death.

In season 7, Baelish gave Bran the knife that was meant to kill him, saying that it started the war of the 5 kings. He was right. Adding on to that, he persuaded Lysa to kill Lord Arryn. If Lord Arryn never died, Robert never would have came to Winterfell, and Ned and the Starks never would have went to King’s Landing. Thus any major plot point you can think of was due to Lord Baelish. 

Littlefinger caused it all. Can anyone think of anything else he caused?",gameofthrones,True,1533954534,2018-08-10

[SPOILERS] Question about White Walkers and their magic.,"So,i had this random thought today about the wight that attacked Jeor Mormont in season one (or book one). Before i explain,i will mostly mention the series since i've not finished reading all the books yet,so if this has been explained,forgive me.

In season one as we all know,a person that persumably died came back to life and went to attack the Lord Commander in his chambers,before he was killed by Jon Snow. Later in the series,we learn that the Wall besides being a massive structrure that protects the Seven Kingdoms against physical attacks,is also infused with magic that counters that of the Others so they won't be able to pass through it. Well,in season seven we find out that the White Walkers are the ones who ressurect the Wights besides controlling them and if a White Walker gets killed,all of the Wights that he ressurected die with him. If that's the case,then does that mean that a White Walker came so far south to be able to ressurect the dead man without the Night's Watch noticing him? And even if that was the case,would he still be able to ressurect the wight despite him technically being on the other side of the Wall?",gameofthrones,True,1533974877,2018-08-11

[Spoilers] Cersei’s death speculation/theory/tinfoil using known production leaks.,"I know everyone is most likely very sick of theories, but this is a long off season so...

[Photographs of inside Titanic Studios shows a set which has the roof destroyed](https://twitter.com/GoTlikeLocation/status/1006109709785534464).  Given the look of the windows it appears to be the throne room.  Further the roof has not (at that point of time, and it was near the end of filming so unlikely to be changed) been painted black to show it was burnt. So it looks like something has crashed into it.  [There were ballistas mounted on the front gates](http://watchersonthewall.com/dragons-to-face-new-threat-in-season-8/), so chances are they will be used.  I believe Rhaegal will be hit by the ballista and crash into the throne room. 


Dany’s visions in the House of the Undying seem to point to death of her children. She goes North of the wall and that is where viserion died.  She goes to a Dothraki tent and that is where Rhaego died.  All the while her dragons are crying out to her for help.  We also see a destroyed throne room.  So it is possible this is where another one of her dragons die.  Bran also saw the same vision of the throne room, which means it is something that will happen and isn’t some kind of metaphor. Bran also sees a dragon flying towards the red keep. And watchers on the wall reported that [King’s Landing will be razed by dragons](http://watchersonthewall.com/exclusive-spoilers-two-main-locations-star-in-game-of-thrones-season-8-battles/).

So what has this got to do with Cersei?  I think she is in the throne room at the time. She has locked herself in there ready to drink poison so she won’t be captured. The dragon misses her but both are still alive.  DnD like to make metaphors literal.  A few examples;

Arya was blinded by revenge

Arya was at the crossroads when she decided to go to Winterfell instead of King’s Landing

Sansa took the leap (from Winterfell wall) and faced her fears
Lysa was standing on the edge (batshit crazy)

Cat was negotiating for Robb’s life with cutthroats

Theon **was** cocky

Jon was lured out by Olly Olly Oxen Free

Cersei was supposed to have a miscarriage at the end of season 7 (awayfortheleads leaks and also the hacked script outline), but that scene was cut.  Most likely moved to season 8.  But when that occurs Cersei (and this is gross) is dead inside.

I think the final one will be Cersei played with fire and gets burnt.

This does loosely fit with the Maggy the Frog prophecy in the books;

“Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.”


The valonqar ( little brother) could be Rhaegal.  All the dragons are the same age, however Rhaegal is smaller than Drogon making him the little brother, by size and not age. But Viserion is also smaller, but a ballista is not going to do much to Viserion and if he falls in the throne room it would be completely destroyed. However Rhaegal would be badly injured so isn’t going to move much. 

Rhaegal does not fit very well into the next part of putting his hands around her throat, so this could be where it all falls apart.  However bat wings are said to be hands because of the digits and thumb.  GRRM specifically modelled his dragons with two legs and bat type wings. But most likely that is for aesthetics. And it seems way to vague for anyone to even pick up on that reference if that is what GRRM was trying to achieve. However with words he can describe Rhaegal’s wings as hands.  And that could be why the show left it out.

So the final result is that Cersei gets trapped by Rhaegal’s wings and is getting crushed.  He wakes up, moves his head closer, opens his mouth,we see the same view of fire in his mouth as when we saw with Tyrion when he took the chains off, except this time he burns her. 

I don’t believe the little brother is jaime, he would never kill Cersei because he thinks she is pregnant.  The same for Tyrion.  For either of them to kill Cersei would be a bad blow for their characters.  It would be a very sad ending for both of them considering how Tyrion felt about killing his father.  It is not a thing he deserves. I can’t see it being Arya since she already did her revenge thing with the Freys, and nobody else really deserves that kill, except maybe Sansa, but I can’t see her doing something with her own hands.

[leaks] Cersei’s death speculation/theory/tinfoil using known production leaks.,"I know everyone is most likely very sick of theories, but this is a long off season so...

[Photographs of inside Titanic Studios shows a set which has the roof destroyed](https://twitter.com/GoTlikeLocation/status/1006109709785534464).  Given the look of the windows it appears to be the throne room.  Further the roof has not (at that point of time, and it was near the end of filming so unlikely to be changed) been painted black to show it was burnt. So it looks like something has crashed into it.  [There were ballistas mounted on the front gates](http://watchersonthewall.com/dragons-to-face-new-threat-in-season-8/), so chances are they will be used.  I believe Rhaegal will be hit by the ballista and crash into the throne room. 


Dany’s visions in the House of the Undying seem to point to death of her children. She goes North of the wall and that is where viserion died.  She goes to a Dothraki tent and that is where Rhaego died.  All the while her dragons are crying out to her for help.  We also see a destroyed throne room.  So it is possible this is where another one of her dragons die.  Bran also saw the same vision of the throne room, which means it is something that will happen and isn’t some kind of metaphor. Bran also sees a dragon flying towards the red keep. And watchers on the wall reported that [King’s Landing will be razed by dragons](http://watchersonthewall.com/exclusive-spoilers-two-main-locations-star-in-game-of-thrones-season-8-battles/).

So what has this got to do with Cersei?  I think she is in the throne room at the time. She has locked herself in there ready to drink poison so she won’t be captured. The dragon misses her but both are still alive.  DnD like to make metaphors literal.  A few examples;

Arya was blinded by revenge

Arya was at the crossroads when she decided to go to Winterfell instead of King’s Landing

Sansa took the leap (from Winterfell wall) and faced her fears
Lysa was standing on the edge (batshit crazy)

Cat was negotiating for Robb’s life with cutthroats

Theon **was** cocky

Jon was lured out by Olly Olly Oxen Free

Cersei was supposed to have a miscarriage at the end of season 7 (awayfortheleads leaks and also the hacked script outline), but that scene was cut.  Most likely moved to season 8.  But when that occurs Cersei (and this is gross) is dead inside.

I think the final one will be Cersei played with fire and gets burnt.

This does loosely fit with the Maggy the Frog prophecy in the books;

“Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said. And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.”


The valonqar ( little brother) could be Rhaegal.  All the dragons are the same age, however Rhaegal is smaller than Drogon making him the little brother, by size and not age. But Viserion is also smaller, but a ballista is not going to do much to Viserion and if he falls in the throne room it would be completely destroyed. However Rhaegal would be badly injured so isn’t going to move much. 

Rhaegal does not fit very well into the next part of putting his hands around her throat, so this could be where it all falls apart.

I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try to get her into GOT while simultaneously refreshing my memory before the next season airs. However, she is not enjoying it so far. She's confused by how everyone relates to each other, what characters are located where and most of all, she can't understand what they're saying half the time.

Right now we are only 5 episodes in, but I'm wondering at what point I should just accept it and let her turn it down. Are there any points you guys think I should force her to get to before she really calls it quits?

[SPOILERS] Does Anyone Else Think That Littlefinger's Death Made Sense Within the Overall Story?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1534009749,2018-08-11
[SPOILERS] Does Anyone Else Think (Major Character's) Death Made Sense Within the Overall Story?,"Of the many contentious points in Season 7, arguably the biggest aside from Episode 6 was the death of Petyr Baelish. I've hard people celebrating the death as a long time coming, calling the scene in which it happens satisfying and well done, but equally people complaining that the death was undeserved, unfitting of Littlefinger's character and shakily set up.

While I do personally think the death could've been set up better within Season 7 itself: showing Bran fully exposing Littlefinger's past to Sansa/Arya, as well as providing a reason why Littlefinger wouldn't flee following the ""chaos is a ladder conversation"" (something as simple as the route to The Vale being a near death sentence in winter could've worked, or him being unable to return to King's Landing because of his past with Cersei), I still the death itself makes itself within the scope of the story as a whole.

Yes, Littlefinger is intelligent. Yes, Littlefinger is powerful. He's cunning, well connected and influential. But he was never invincible, and worse still, in Season 7 he was in unfamiliar territory.

We see a fatal flaw in his ""game"" as early as Season 2. Cersei, a character who wields much more straightforward, pure power, could've immediately ended the game and crushed Baelish with one order to the Kingsguard. All his scheming and intelligence was shown to be powerless against someone who both wielded power and understood the type of person he was.

We see this to an even greater extent with Varys, another player in the ""game"" who fully understands Littlefinger's true self and motivations. Varys is equally connected, intelligent and knowledgable and so is shown to be on equal footing to Baelish. *Now imagine Varys x1000*. A character knowledgeable about not just every secret in the realm, along with the motivations and past of every inhabitant, but who also possesses supernatural abilities and can't be swayed, bought or misled. **That character is Bran Stark.**

Those that talk about Littlefinger's skill at the ""game"" don't seem to mention that Littlefinger never could've predicted or factored in a supernatural element entering in. His game works best with those he knows and understands (Ned Stark, for example), in familiar territory (King's Landing), and with others he can use for his own ends. None of those were present at Winterfell.

By Season 7, Baelish was out of his depth. He was in an area of Westeros he wasn't familiar with and that took honour far more seriously. He couldn't rely on Sansa to support him in his game (she was on to him as early as Season 6, that much was made clear). He had never met or understood Arya in any real capacity, and worst of all, Bran was literally the foil to his entire scheme, a character who possessed every truth and every secret surrounding him, with supernatural skills he clearly underestimated or disbelieved. Not to mention that **every one of these hostile factors he had a hand in creating.**

Like Ned Stark whom he betrayed, he found himself in a city that didn't share his ideals, surrounded be people who hated him and wanted him gone. By the trial, which I believe was done quite well, him not making it out alive was not only guaranteed but obvious. He was powerless, exposed and had lost his main source of power: words, which he still tried to spit out even as he bled to death. So for me, even if not executed 100% well, his death still felt justified. His actions caught up with him, and at a point in the story that made sense.

[Spoilers] Lightbringer Theory,"I have a little theory about season 8 involving the ancestral Valyrian Steel sword of house Dayne: Lightbringer.

I know that the sword isn't passed down to every male heir of House Dayne, but rather one who is worthy enough to bear the title of ""Sword of the Morning"". However, in the current situation the living find themselves in they are in dire need of tools to defeat the white walkers and their army of the dead. Tons of dragon glass is being mined on Dragonstone, but the number of known Valyrian blades is five (Longclaw, Oathkeeper, Widow's Wail, Heartsbane, and the Catspaw). I may be missing one, but I think that number is correct. 

So with the incredibly finite amount of Valyrian steel, could we potentially see the ancestral Dayne sword come into play? After all Night always ends in Light. Let me know what you guys think!",gameofthrones,True,1534039388,2018-08-11

[spoilers] Speculation on the ending,"Following the standard hero's journey, 5 of our main characters all started in a place of comfort, but there was a problem. Arya wanted to be able to fight like the boys, Bran used to climb walls to see further, jon didn't want to be a bastard, Sansa wanted to marry joffrey and be Queen and Dany wanted a home and family.

Those things no longer matter to them as Sansa doesn't want another husband. Arya is an assassin, Bran just wants to walk let alone climb, jon became king so being a bastard didn't matter, Dany went home to Dragonstone and it didn't feel like home.

So now Bran can see so far he probably sees into the future. Jon is not only not a bastard but heir to the throne. I believe Sansa will become Queen and as a regnant. Arya will become a knight and Dany with jon will go back to old Valyria. She gets a whole country as her home with family. I don't think the targs will be wanted in westeros after giving the NK a dragon, also if a dragon survives it doesn't belong in westeros. The Unsullied also go and with the dragons (more will come), will protect Naath (note about this at bottom). Sansa won't rule alone she will rule with Arya and Bran, and their plan is to become the start of a democracy.

So we have the bitter part to all the sweet part of their wish fulfillment at the end of their journeys. Bran will never walk, Sansa will never marry, Dany will never rule, The family jon knew are not as he thinks and Arya will never fight like a man, but she fights differently and better.

I think we see the end of all houses. This is the last generation. Even jon and dany who will become Valyrians and not Targaryens.

Also their journeys align to the god of the seven if we include the other two main houses Baratheon and Lannister (all 4 sigils shown in the opening credits on the armillary sphere).  Father - jon, will judge the souls of the dead.  Dany- mother (mhysa). Sansa - maiden (never marries again). Arya-stranger.  Bran-crone. Gendry-smith. Tyrion-warrior.  Tyrion fighting in the great war as a dwarf with no skills, shows him as being the bravest, a true warrior.  You can only be brave when you are afraid.  

Also the rebirth of old Valyria sounds a lot like the Azor Ahai prophecy.  Reborn amidst salt and smoke,the smoking sea.  Under a bleeding star, the volcanoes shooting lava and covering old Valyria.  Wake dragons from stone.  All the dragonlords and dragons are covered by lava and are now stone.  Reawaken it means a new era of dragons. 



* note on Naath.  A dialogue was cut from season 7 (information came from awayforthelads) where Missandei and grey worm talk about plans after the war.  GW says they don't belong in Westeros and asks Missandei if she will return home after their Queen wins the war.  Missandei says their home is with their Queen and Naath are peaceful (meaning they are not sage from slavers).  GW replies that the Unsullied are not peaceful and will protect Naath.  From valyria the Unsullied and any remaining dragons can protect Naath.

[Spoilers] Starks and the Betrayals,"Most of the starks we have known died due to betrayals.

2.Ned betrayed by Littlefinger &amp; later Joffrey
3.Robb,Talisa &amp; Catelyn by Boltons &amp; Freys.
4.Jon Snow by the brothers of the nights watch.
Only Starks that didn't die due to betrayals are Lyanna &amp; Benjen.Technically Lyanna died as a Targaryen while Jon who actually is a Targaryen have all the traits &amp; values of a Stark.I don't know about Benjen though. 
So my question is if whether Night King who is presumed to be a Stark was betrayed too and he is coming to seek revenge of that betrayal?The way he looked at 3 eyed raven before killing him makes me believe that he was betrayed &amp; something wrong was done to him.If Bran dies then i think he'll be betrayed too or perhaps already been betrayed by 3 eyed raven.Old Nan also said that ""Don't listen to the crows.They are all liers"".The intention of 3 eyed Raven might not be bad though &amp; perhaps it was out of necessity.What are your thoughts about it?

[No Spoilers] Stories Similar to The Hound's?,"Hey r/gameofthrones, I've been a fan of ASOIAF for about five years now and I've read the series multiple times. One of my favorite characters is the Hound as well as his story.

[SPOILERS] Viserion Question,"So HBO had to provide the accompanying scripts for the episodes submitted for Emmy awards.

In the script for 7:07 it details that Viserion was turned “just like Craster’s sons.” This implies that Viserion is a White Dragon rather than a wight dragon. 

I always assumed that in ordered to be turned into a White the subject had to be a living sacrifice, just as we see Craster’s sons are. 

Viserion seemed pretty definitely dead to me. Is this a continuity error or intentionally telling us something about the creation of White Walkers and wights? Additionally, what other implications come from Viserion being a White Dragon that shoots blue flames?",gameofthrones,True,1534128424,2018-08-12
[SPOILERS] A few questions that have me thinking. Curious on people’s thoughts.,"1) As King in the North, could Jon have legitimised himself? (assuming he was a bastard)

2) Why didn’t Ned ask Robert to legitimise Jon?

3) If Jon was legitimised by king Robert, effectively making him Jon Stark, would that have any impact on his claim to the throne?(Would he still have a claim?)

4) Why didn’t Ned demand a trial by combat? (I know he probably wouldn’t have got one anyway, but why didn’t he even ask)

5) Why didn’t Cersei want Ned dead? 

6) Who was Catelyn’s and Ned’s favourite child? (i feel like it might have secretly been Bran)

7) Why didn’t Arya use one of her 3 death wishes on Cersei? 

8) Why didn’t Jamie tell his side of the story about killing the Mad King sooner?

9) If Cersei bent the knee to Daenerys, would she still burn her alive or allow her to live? 

10) How different would the story be if Tommen didn’t commit suicide and was still the king instead of Cersei?",gameofthrones,True,1534129680,2018-08-12
[Spoilers] Finished Book 2 Thoughts,"I'm literally taking notes chapter by chapter. Here's the tldr version:  small and big changes abound in book 2. The show would've benefited greatly if they had the budget they have now in earlier seasons. So many more fun battles. Having said that, the Canonists, the people that think the book is always better than the show, are stupid. The Battle of Black Water Bay is much better in the show. Arya and Tywin is a thousand times better dynamic than Arya and Roose Bolton. But there are also some things I really would've liked to see in the show, the Stannis loyalists telling Joffrey off, Weasel (Arya) and the broth jail escape, the riot in King's Landing is way better in the books, etc. 

Donal Noye, excellent character, one armed blacksmith that crafted Robert's war hammer and was sent to the wall.

""We're all liars here and every one of us is better than you."" In the show, this is a Bealish line, in the books it's a Hound line. I'm surprised by my reaction to this but it angers me that this was changed. 

Patchface, very interesting character, possible water wight, fool that speaks in riddles and song, but often times what he fixates on is of great importance.

Maester Cressen is much sadder in the books. He was basically a surrogate father to Stannis and tried everything he could think of to avert disaster for his Lord, even going so far as to poison himself and the red woman to put an end to her trickery, but she was unaffected by the poison and his plan came undone. 

Davos has multiple sons in the book.

Bronn isn't head of the Night's Watch when Janos Slynt is sent to the wall. It's another man, Ser Jacelyn, that Tyrion aides in exchange for loyal service and to remove the Gold Cloaks out of Cersei's hand. 

Lord Baelish talks openly about taking the Tully girls (Lyssa and Catelyn) virginity. I hate him even more in the books.

Stannis hits Storm's End in the books while that fool Renly is having a mock tourney to celebrate his foregone victory. Summer boys fail at winter war. So there are two shadows, one was used to kill Renly and the second was used to kill Lord Cortnay Penrose who held Storm's End after Renly died. But the important thing to understand is that Stannis gave Melissandre the One True D, not once but twice. It's also interesting how Stannis dreams and his shadow acts out the dream. He actually sees his brother die as if he were actually there. So the shadow, isn't a child so much as an extension of Stannis himself. Also Melissandre beams with light when she gives birth. Again, it seems a lack of budget forced things to be simplified. Only one shadow means you can get away with not showing Storm's End and that shadow cgi was probably expensive in its own right. 

Theon's conversation with Yara (Asha in the books) when first arrives on Pyke goes about similarly. She's married in the books. 

Tyrion poisons Cersei to make her have incontrollable bowels so she'll be out of his hair as he can make plans for Kings Landing's defense. 

The seastone chair at Pyke. You don't see it in the show I believe but it's carved from this black stone thousands of years ago into the shape of a kraken. Some think it's evil. 

Ser Alliser Thorne is sent to King's Landing with the hand that was cut off from that wight that attacked Jon Snow and Lord Commander Mormont. By the time he gets to King's Landing, it decomposes. Thorne is openly mocked but Tyrion does supply the watch with more men although, he does so in a manner that makes it suggest he doesn't take the man seriously and just wants to be rid of him. 

Arya's kill list has way more characters in it:  Dunsen, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling, Weese. All Lannister soldiers and they reveled in cruelty. I really wish Game of Thrones started with the budget they have today but the decisions to cut some of these minor characters make sense but the book is made richer by comparison. 

Ramsay makes noise much earlier in the books. While the rest of the North is at war, he raises a host army at the Dread Fort. He has a companion, Reek. Not Theon Greyjoy, this one was with Ramsay from the time he was a boy. Ramsay kidnaps Lady Hornwood and forces her to marry him so he can take her lands. Ser Roddrick goes to deal with Ramsay and ""Ramsay"" is killed and Reek captured. What actually happened was Reek was killed and Ramsay took his clothes and covered himself in shit so he could pretend to be Reek. Ser Roddrick keeps ""Reek"" alive to act as a witness to Ramsay's crimes. Ladyhornwood starved to death in a tower where Ramsay imprisoned her. Jojen Reed has a green dream where ""Reek"" skins both Bran and Rickon and he shares this information with Bran. Green dreams always come true.

The Quaithe touches Dany on her wrist and it tingles. I've heard a theory where Dany is poisoned by Xaro Xhoan Daxos and that tingle is the Quaithe delivering an antidote. The presence of Dany's dragons and their growth coincides with the growth of magic. In the show the warlocks tell this to Dany in the House of the Undying, in the book the Quaithe reveals it to her. 

There's a small scene where the Princess Myrcella is being sent to Dorne and Tommen cries. Joffrey mocks him saying ""princes aren't supposed to cry"" and Sansa points out a couple of historical examples that disprove him. In the show, Sansa says her brother cried when she left Winterfell. It's a small difference but it seems to me D&amp;D avoided the lore when they could so as not to confuse the viewers. 

I like the riot in King's Landing better in the books. ""Brotherfucker, brotherfucker, brotherfucker."" After the Hound saved Sansa, he was most concerned with finding his horse, Stranger. The case of Tyrek, the missing Lannister. I've heard some theories about this. 

The cache of dragonglass daggers that Jon discovers (in the show it's Sam) at the Fist of the First Men was left by someone. If I had to guess, either the Children or Cold Hands. (he doesn't make an appearance in book 2 as of yet, but I am aware of him). Some of the men of the Night's Watch grumbled early on about betraying Geor Mormont and Jon caught some of their conversation but dismissed as a result of fear and hunger, just empty words. You get much more of Qhorin Halfhand in the books. He's very loyal to the Watch, he doesn't hesitate at the prospect of sacrificing himself for the greater good. Mance is after some magical horn to bring down the wall. 

Again the mention of Ashara Dayne as a possible mother of Jon Snow. There are subtle references to Catelyn Stark and stone emotions and feelings. 

That fool Theon takes ""Reek"" (Ramsay) into his service when he takes Winterfell. The Bloody Mummers switch allegiance to the North in negotiation with Roose Bolton. Vargo Hoats lisp is annoying, but he's an interesting character. I know he's Locke in the show. Arya blackmails Jaqen into helping the ""captured"" Northern soldiers. I very much liked the boiling vats of broth being thrown into the faces of the Lannister guards. Also after they've taken the castle, Arya is named Roose Bolton's cupbearer and Amory Lorch is paraded around Harrenhal naked and then thrown into a bear pit, good times. 

The House of the Undying and the imagery from the doors inside is noteworthy. The doors on the left are visions of the future, past and terror. Clear reference to Rob and the Red Wedding, a dead King with a wolf's head clutching a leg of lamb. The vision of Rhaegar with Elia and their child. Rhaegar claiming there must be another for the 'dragon has three heads.' The Undying she meets with tells her she'll face three betrayals then tries to drain the life from her. 

Jon Snow and Iggrite's meeting is much more interesting in the book. She says he has a cursed name, tells him the tale of Bael the Bard. Possible Night King identity. Kinslayers are fucked. 

Sansa and Ser Dontos have regular discussions in the lead up to the Battle of Blackwater Bay. Sansa's talks with the Hound are always interesting. I'm mad that ""if you're weak get out of the way and die, strong arms and strong steel rule this world, never forget it"" didn't make it into the show, such a great line from the Hound. 

Jon has a wolf dream. He sees Bran as a weirwood tree and Bran tries to open his third eye. He scouts Mance's vast camp from afar. It would seem that magic is growin in the North as well. Qorin and his more experienced rangers openly accept Jon's wolf dream without hesitation.

It's Ramsay's idea to use the two farm boys as stand ins for Bran and Rickon. Their bodies aren't burned, the heads are cut off and dipped in tar, the silver wolf broach Bran used to wear is burned with his clothes and reclaimed as evidence. Maester Leun does not react in despair, he keeps his resolve but is still deeply wounded by it. Theon won't have the bodies placed in the Winterfell crypts. When Asha leaves Theon with only 10 more men, ""Reek"" offers to find 200 men that can come to Theon's aide in return for Stark silver. Man, Theon is a fucking idiot. 

The conversation between Catelyn and Jaime is different. I like the show version of it better when Catelyn nearly bashes in Jaime's skull with a rock. 

The Battle of Black Water Bay is very different in the books. Tyrion's chain wall that rises out of the sea trapping Stannis' burning fleet after the wildfire explosion is major. The fact that Stannis is not on a ship and is instead already landed with his host. Davos' dialogue is weaker in the books, ""Mathos!!! GET DOWN!!!!"" is instead replaced with ""No. Nooooooooo!"" Tyrion's part of the battle is absurd. He probably kills at least a dozen soldiers in the books. Give me a fucking break. The Hound doesn't tell Joffrey off in the books. Disappointing changes about in the book version. I like what the show did better. 

People thought that that idiot Loras Tyrell was Renly because he was wearing his armor. A clever trick I'll admit. The fools that broke from Stannis' army cheering ""Renly!"" are all probably going to be executed by Joffrey. Good job dumb fucks. 

Dany's encounter at the House of Undying leads to the Warlocks vowing revenge. They promise three betrayals, one for blood, one for gold and one for love. The witch was for blood. The other two haven't happened yet. The attempted assassination by the Sorrowful Men who always say ""I am so sorry"" right before they kill you were the ones that used the poison manticore. Ser Barristan has an odd companion named Belwas, a sellsword formerly of the fighting pits, hired by Illyrio Mopatis. 

Roose Bolton and the Bloody Mummers were in many ways worse than the Lannisters that held Harrenhal. Arya decided once she learned that Roose Bolton would be turning Harnehal over to Vargo Hoat that it was time to leave. She kills a guard by dropping the coin of Bravos and stabbing him in the neck. In the show, this happens much later and it's not a Bolton man she kills to escape Harrenhal, it's a Frey she kills for revenge after the Red Wedding. 

The aftermath of the Battle of Black Water Bay was disgusting pageantry. I respect that not all those captured yielded like pathetic cowards. A few notable men told Joffrey off to his face. These were Stannis men to the last. I would've liked this scene in the show. 

Ramsay returns with 200 Bolton men and attacks Ser Rodrick and those he'd gathered to retake Winterfell from Theon. Theon, the fool, opened the gates without any hesitation and Ramsay cut his men down and ordered Winterfell burned. ",gameofthrones,True,1534131762,2018-08-12

In the most recent finale episode I think they call it Littlefinger’s dagger, did they also accuse him of sending the assassin?

For this week's episode, we decided to look at the cultural impact of ""Game of Thrones"". We'd love if you all checked it out and shared your thoughts!

The success of HBO's Game of Thrones has been credited with an increase in the popularity of fantasy themes in mass media. How has Game of Thrones' influence impacted and permeated other fantasy universes and pop culture? In this episode, we explore the fantasy genre pre-Game of Thrones, critique the deviations from novels for the Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings universes, and examine Game of Thrones as second-wave feminist art.

Can someone explain to me something Melisandre says in season 5 episode 5?,"So I’m currently re watching season 5 and 6 as I just finished the 3rd book. 

In episode 5 of season 5, Melisandre is trying to convince Jon to come with Stannis. She tries to allure and seduce him. Jon tells her he still loves Ygritte. 

When Melisandre walks away, she gives him an odd look and says “You know nothing, Jon Snow...” and Jon sort of looks at her like, wtf?

Can someone explain this? This is obviously something only Ygritte said. I find it odd how Melisandre said it, kind of hinting at something maybe. I just found it odd. ",gameofthrones,True,1534231871,2018-08-14

The rightful heir to the iron throne [SPOILERS],"So what if Rhaegar didn't actually run off with Lyanna Stark,what if Lyanna actually turned out to be a baker of pies and because of Rhaegar's love for pies, he reluctantly anulled his marriage with Elia Martell and ran off with Hot Pie's mother after that tourney?

He'll never lose any battles because he knows to always have armor on in a battle and he's not going to have any trouble getting a queen to give him some sons since he's got Arya pretty much chasing after that monster cock of his.

"[SPOILERS] Felt pretty proud of this prequel pitch, wanted to see if it held up on Reddit","[TL;DR version at the bottom]

I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday about some of the different spin-off show ideas that have been released when this just came to me. Again, I felt pretty proud of it, not just because of the concept, but because it could encompass three or four whole shows for the price of one. Feel free to tear it apart with any and all criticisms, I'm posting this to get better at writing and content creating and I need all the help I can get.

The show would cover the near three-hundred year rule of the Targaryens, focusing on perspectives of the kings and the events that took place throughout their reign. Each season, making the ballsy assumption that I could ever get a multi-season show green-lighted by HBO, would be comparable in size to GOT with some being a bit longer and some being a bit shorter.

The first half of season one would begin on Dragonstone, giving a brief bit of background to the Doom of Valyria and how the Targaryens fled to Westeros. The following episodes would quickly shift to focus on Aegon, his conquest, and the formation of the Seven Kingdoms. The second half of season one would skip over Aenys to the rule of Maegor, his war against the faith, Prince Aegon’s “rebellion”, and the Black Brides. The season would end with Maegor being found dead on the Iron Throne, and Aenys’ son Jaehaerys’ ascension to the throne.

The first episode or so of season two would focus on the final years of Viserys I, but mostly it would give context and a setup for the rest of the season, the Dance of Dragons. Pretty self-explanatory, but it would show the intensity of the war from both sides, not to mention a lot of dragon duels. It would end with Rhaenyra’s death at the hands of Aegon II, his subsequent death, and the ascension of Aegon III.

Season three would cover the later Dornish wars led by Daeron I and the aftermath of their failure with the rule of Baelor. The first half of the season four would focus on Daeron, his initial conquest of Dorne, and the eventual rebellion that led to the death of the king, his generals, and many of his men. Daeron’s death made way for Baelor and his questionable sanity. The second half of the season would begin with his march of penance to Dorne and the return trip with his cousin Aemon the Dragonknight, the resurgence of the faith of the seven, and the Maiden Vault. The season would end with Baelor’s death by willful starvation, and the ascension of his uncle Viserys II. Throughout the season, Prince Viserys would also share the spotlight with Daeron and Baelor as one of the most influential Hands of the King to that point.

Season four would skip the reign of Viserys II, and head straight for his son Aegon the Unworthy. Aegon, his many mistresses, and his bastards would be the primary focus of the first few episodes before eventually giving way to the rise of the bastard House Blackfire, led by Aegon Blackfyre. The Blackfyre Rebellion would take up the greater chunk of the season, ending of course with it being put down and Daeron II securing the throne. The last few episodes would focus on Daeron’s efforts towards the Dornish Unification, and the double marriage of Daeron and Daenerys to the Prince and Princess of Dorne.

All of season five would focus mostly on the life of Aegon the Fifth, skipping over King Aerys I and King Maekar. The first half would be his adventures with Duncan the Tall, going all around the Seven Kingdoms and generally having light-hearted fun. The mid-season would end with the Second Blackfyre Rebellion, and Duncan and Aegon’s part in the conflict. The second half of the season would pick up with the Peake Uprsing and King Maekar’s death at Starpike. After the Great Council, the rest of the season would cover Aegon’s reign up until his death. The season would end with the Tragedy at Summerhall, and the birth of Rhaegar Targaryen. His older brother, Maester Aemon, would also make appearances throughout the season.

The final season, of the show would skip over the reign of King Jaehaerys II right to Aegon’s grandson, Aerys II. His is probably the most familiar story, and as such the season would cover not only the life of the king, but also famous events such as the War of the Ninepenny Kings, the various adventures of the most famous roster of the Kingsguard, and of course Robert’s Rebellion. This season could show the gradual, and then very sudden decline of King Aerys into madness, with his wife’s various miscarriages and the Defiance of Duskendale. The season would end with the crowning of Robert Baratheon, or maybe the birth of Daenerys Targaryen on Dragonstone.

So there you have it, my full pitch for a GOT spin-off show. You may have noticed that I haven’t given a name and that’s because I like to save the best, or at least the most interesting for me, for last.

I find it interesting that, if this was GRRMs intention, he made the Dothraki the polar opposite of he hobbits of the Shire as a people. Dothraki are wild and barbaric and kill for sport while hobbits are gentle, generous, and tiny and hate adventure (except the bagginses). ",gameofthrones,True,1534334602,2018-08-15

[Spoilers] Was Winterfell the first House of Black and White?,"More precise, are the caverns under Winterfell the same as what might be found under the House of Black and White?

One necessity for this theory is the acceptance of another theory that the House of Black and White made an alliance with the Children of the Forest, first created in the hellish mines of Valeria. Valar morghulis!

So if the Children of the Forest use sacrifice to work their dark magic, the House of Black and White makes for a perfect facade to clandestinely collect those sacrifices. It could be from these yet unveiled dark caverns under the temple that they magically destroyed Valeria.

So could something similar be hidden under the crypts of Winterfell? Did the children store their human sacrifices from the many years of war with the First Men at this site? Could this location have been the power source for the Hammer of the Waters that destroyed the Arm of Dorne? This kind of Dark Magic might require multiple locations, one to cast and one to power.

Since the timeline is unreliable, we could assume that The Children of the Forest may have attempted to divide Westeros too soon after the Arm of Dorne, lacking the needed amount of sacrifice (to feed the Firewyrms well below the surface?). 

Could this be why the Children of the Forest agreed to the pact; they did not have enough time to collect more sacrifices? And was surrendering the land on which Winterfell would be built part of the pact?  The First Men no doubt wanted to take away the children’s’ weapon of mass destruction. This could explain the peculiar design of the crypts, with the oldest tombs located at the bottom.

The appearance of the Others may be prerequisite to each catastrophe. If so, does the return of the Others now signal a new doom? With its signs of volcanic activity, perhaps the Doom of Dragonstone is next. If the next Hammer/Doom is anything like the Doom of Valeria, King’s Landing could also likely disappear. This time, the Children of the Forest might just succeed in breaking Westeros in two.

[SPOILERS] What is this bullshit theory I'm seeing?,"Since Game of Thrones was less enjoyable for me than previous seasons, I have dutifully ignored the world of Westeros for the past year. But since Google knows everything about me, they've slipped a ""Cersei's gonna be the Night Queen"" article on me.

What the hell? Who is thinking these things? I think that entire idea goes against the fundamental point the show's been trying to say for at least 3 seasons now: rich or peasant, bastard or nobility, Stark or Lannister, we're *all fucked* when the zombies come. We will all either fight back (presumably together) or we'll all, everybody, no *er'body's* gonna end up in the army of the dead.

What makes Cersei special to the Night King? I will confess, I haven't even read this theory in detail because the article title pissed me awf. You just know that Cersei would happily let everybody become zombies if she could be the Zombie Queen...which goes against the entire point.",gameofthrones,True,1534370735,2018-08-15

[SPOILERS] Original theory about how it all ends,"I had an epiphany today and now think I know how the show is going to end. I am writing this down for posterity's sake as I believe this is an original idea.   


If anyone else has come up with this already I'd be very curious to compare notes with them!  


Spoilers ahead, S1-S7 and all the books.

The points get weaker as they go down, but I think there is enough evidence to strongly support this theory.

**Dany and Jon are going to have a baby, but it is going to be a White Walker.**

I think one of the final scenes of the series will be the newborn child of Dany and Jon opening it's icy blue eyes.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:

1.) Mirri Maz Duur's prophecy:

 *""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""* 

  
The show has made it very obvious in Season 7 that Dany and Jon are going to have a baby. There was heavy foreshadowing about their budding romance, and IMO the show runners could have left it at that if there was no baby, but the heir/Dany's ability to get pregnant/Jon questioning Mirri Maz Duur's credibility was brought up many times.

In regards to the prophecy there are four options:

A.) It is not a prophecy, just ravings of a vengeful woman.

 \-- If this was the case it would not be brought up as many times as it is by the show and the books. Also least interesting of the options to let such a plot line fizzle. 

B.) It is a prophecy, but the terms have already been met.

\-- There is a popular theory out there that says that the other components of the prophecy have already been fulfilled. I don't have the link, but it involves:

Quentyn Martell (sun sigil) sailing from the west. The sea could be the Dothraki sea, and the mountain could be the Mountain. 

I highly doubt this, as the terms aren't for her to have a living child but for her to see Khal Drogo as he once was, with bearing a living child as a requirement. The prophecy does not say if the first three things happen she can bear a living child. Also all three of those are kind of shaky IMO. 

C.) The prophecy is misinterpreted, and Dany can have a living child because she is misinterpreting the prophecy.

\-- There is the quote in AFfC that supports this:

 *“...Prophecy is like a treacherous woman. She takes your member in her mouth, and you moan with the pleasure of it and think, how sweet, how fine, how good this is... and then her teeth snap shut and your moans turn to screams... Prophecy will bite your prick off everytime,”* 

\-- As well as Jon saying MMD might not have been the most reliable source.

HOWEVER:

Martin was quoted as saying: *""Prophecy is a staple element in fantasy, but it's tricky… You want to play with the notion of prophecies coming true but in an unexpected way.""*   


So that leads me to option D:

D.) The prophecy will come true in an unexpected way.

\-- The prophecy says: ""*When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child.""* 

A **living** child.

That is just the kind of detail Martin would sneak in there. 

Dany is going to give birth to a child of **ice** **and fire.** The fire side is well covered with Jon being half Targaryen and Dany being all Targaryen, and the ice is currently under represented. (Jon is only half ""ice"", being half Stark).

If she gives birth to a White Walker it is not a living child.

2.) The story will have a ""bittersweet ending"". 

Martin was quoted as having said as much. I started thinking about this theory because how else can the ending be bittersweet? If the White Walkers or Cersei or any other third party rule all it would not be sweet, but it Jon and Dany rule side-by-side after defeating all it would not be bitter. The leading suggestions are that Jon will have to kill Dany. I could see one or both of them having to kill this child to seal away darkness forever as a very beautiful ending.

Also, if Jon is Azor Ahai reborn, (Personally i am %100 bought in to the fact that AA was Rhaegar and that Jon is Lightbringer), but if Jon is Azor Ahai it would make sense that he has to sacrifice this child in order to parallel the sacrifice that AA the First had to make in order to seal away the White Walkers the first time.

That would also satisfy another prophecy: Dany's three betrayals. She still has to be betrayed for love, which would be perfectly fulfilled by above.

3.) Chekhov's gun/Craster's infant sons

There is a pivotal scene in the earlier seasons where Jon sees Kraster sacrificing his infant son to the Night King, turning him into a White Walker. Chekhov's gun is a concept in literature stating every element in a story must be necessary, ie: ""If you see a gun in the first act it will go off in the second.""

There are a lot of horrific one-off things throughout the show, but they keep reminding us of that one. (Gilly brings her rescued baby along for the plot-ride throughout most of the books/show. To remind us.)

4.) One of the Night's Kings (there seem to be multiple throughout history) was a Stark of Winterfell and a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

This wiki page provides more information, [http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s\_King](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_King) but Old Nan told Bran about one of the Night's Kings being a Stark of Winterfell that was a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch that fell in love with a woman ""**with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars""** he loved her ""**though her skin was cold as ice"".** This Night's King brought this woman to the Nightfort and bound his black brothers to his will.

I think this is relevant because of the mysterious ties between the Stark bloodline and the White Walkers, the parallels of the woman this Night's King loved and Dany (imagery of pale, ""moon of my life"", skin being ice cold vs being impervious to fire.) While I don't think Dany is an ice queen or undead in anyway, it brings me to my next point:

5.) Jon is some sort of undead being.

We have no idea what happens when you are brought back from death by R'hllor, but it does provide the ""how"" of the ""how could Dany and Jon even have an undead child?"". There is enough mystery there that the showrunners could provide some serious support for in time for the big reveal.

**TLDR:**

**Due to the tricky wording of Dany not being able to bear a ""living"" child, the foreshadowing that she is going to have a baby,  the expected ""bittersweet ending"" of the series, the fact that an old Night's King was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and a Stark, that Jon is undead by mysterious circumstances, that Dany must still be betrayed for love, the cyclical nature of the White Walkers being sealed away the first time and returning, and finally that there is precedence for infant children being turned into White Walkers:**

**I believe that Dany and Jon will have a child but it will be born as  a White Walker and either Dany or Jon will have to sacrifice it to emulate the sacrifice Azor Ahai made when he sealed away the darkness the first time.**",gameofthrones,True,1534388606,2018-08-15

[SPOILERS] The prophecy of Mirri Maz Duur is near complete.,"The curse/prophecy of Daenerys is “""when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves, when your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child.""

Let’s examine that a bit… “when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east...” This could mean the planet goes retrograde, perhaps as part of something that happens when a really bad winter approaches or is in full swing, something that nobody would know that, except for perhaps the Maesters, because the last time it happened was beyond recent memory; and everyone keeps saying this winter will be the worst in a thousand years. This kind of “winter” is a special winter, not regular, which we know Westeros has, because Tyrion says he’s seen a few winters, but nothing remarkable came of those.

“...When the seas go dry...” Frozen, perhaps? A desert is merely a place where life is difficult and the landscape inhospitable. In the real-world, Antarctica is a desert, by definition; and for the Dothraki, who are used to sand and dirt, the idea of desert would be perhaps a bit different.

“...and mountains blow in the wind like leaves...” This could be a foretelling of the Wall collapse from the attack of The Night King riding the now undead Viserion. Likely, the Dothraki would see the Wall as a mountain, and so would have Mirri Maz Duur, having never seen such a sight as a literal giant wall made of ice, she could easily have misinterpreted the vision as a mountain.

“...when your womb quickens again...” This, I believe is a representative of Daenery’s desire to mate again...which she does, finally, with Jon Snow...who at that point still knows nothing of his true lineage.

“...and you bear a living child...” Targaryans were known inbreeders. Perhaps not because of the love of blood purity, as the myth is explained, but because it is insanely difficult for them to breed with non-Targaryens. We do not know if Daenerys would have carried the child to life or not, as she sacrificed it to heal Drogo, and we know how poorly that went. Jon Snow, is her nephew, the son of Rhaegar, he is a Tergaryen. Daenerys will conceive a child, a living child, with Jon, and give birth to him/her. This will, of course, be a great surprise to everyone, especially Daenerys.

But there is one part of this that is often left out. ...”Then he will return, and not before.” The “he” in this is Drogo, the Khal, the dead Khal and husband to Daenerys.  The prophecy was about when would Drogo heal and get better, not, as it was often relayed, about Daenery’s ability to have additional progeny.

Once Daenery’s gives birth, Drogo will return. Possibly as a wight, but return he will.

[SPOILERS] New take on Gendry being ____'s son.,"So I saw a video dismissing the theory that Gendry was Cersei's supposedly deceased brown haired son and generally I've also always dismissed this theory but I might have changed my tune.

This only deals with the show since I've not read the books and this isn't necessarily stating that it will be revealed that Gendry is really Cersei's son on the show, only that there is some compelling evidence to that and it would make a very interesting story.

My theory goes that Cersei and Robert legit have a baby, the brown haired one she tells Cat about and that baby was Gendry.  Cersei obviously loves her children, it is her 1 redeeming feature aside from her cheek bones.  And we know that she is terrified about he Maggy the Frog prophecy about her children dying.


So what if Cersei faked the death of her first child in an attempt to trick prophecy and save her first born son?  We know Robert didn't love her, was constantly drunk and whoring and hunting and based on Joffrey we know he was not an attentive parent.
  So we know he likely isn't very informed about his kids.

What if Cersei conspires with the grand maester to give baby gendry a potion/poison that will fake his death like maybe some essence of nightshade or something.  There are real chemicals that mimic death but leave the person alive so perhaps something was used to fake the death of baby Gendry.

We know Cersei can act so she pretends to freak out to convince Robert, we know Pycell has ""always been loyal to house Lannister"" so he could definitely help and keep his trap shut and so Cersei can have the baby ""taken to the crypts"" where she never visits.


Gendry is then taken away to be cared for by someone else but Cersei being the loving mother she is still visits her son and sings to him like he remembers.  Maybe she even sings the rains of castermere because of course she would.  But Cersei has a problem when Gendry gets a little older and can recognize her better.  He would be in danger if he started claiming the queen was his mother and he was just some random lowborn kid.  So Cersei has to stop visiting him and Gendry is told his mother is dead.


Fast forward several years and Ned arrives, Robert dies, Joffrey goes nuts etc.  But what happens with Gendry?  Gendry is magically saved by being given to the Watch.  This is an important bit.


Ned meets Gendry and mentions that he is a very skilled smith.  His master agrees but later Gendry says his master gave him to the Nights Watch.  Why would a tradesman give away someone as skilled as Gendry?  It makes no sense.  Unless it was because of a royal decree.

We know it was Joffrey that ordered the death of all Roberts bastards.  What if Cersei finds out and she tells Gendry's master (name I forget) that he has to give Gendry to the Watch.  Maybe she forces him, maybe she pays him but the point is Cersei know that her hidden son who is thought to be a bastard must join the watch in order to be safe from a vengeful king...  Are we seeing the parallel yet?


Cersei saves Gendry by having him sent to the watch just like Ned did with Jon.  2 parents that both would do anything to protect their children sending their secret children who are both thought to be bastards to the wall for their protection from a king who would kill them because of the challenge to the their claim to the throne the child represents.  This would be a perfect parallel between Ned and Cersei in how they both love their family and act to protect it even when it costs them personally.

Now Gendry doesn't actually need to learn this or have this revealed in any big way since at this point his lineage isn't as relevant as Jons is but I do think that this could be an interesting twist on the dynamic between Cersei and Ned specifically as well as just a fun theory.

"[SPOILERS] Theory on Jon Snow, Melisandre and Davos","I dont know if this has been brought up or not and if it has then I'm sorry for doing it again.

I was watching season 6 again and the scene where Jon is brought back to life I just couldn't get out of my head something that Thoros said back in season 3. When Melisandre asked Thoros how was able to resurrect Beric. He said that just just asked to have his friend back. He had lost all faith in the Lord of Light and he just sat down next to Beric dead body and asked him to bring back his friend. A few seconds late his friend was back.

When watching Melisandre trying to bring back Jon she didn't have the same conviction. She was not trying to bring back one of her friends. She was just trying to see what she could do. It didn't matter to her if Jon was dead. She had already given up on Jon. Saying that the Lord of the Light had lied to her. She had seen Jon in the last great battle and now he was dead. There was one person there that has no faith in the Lord of Light and he just wanted his friend back. He went begging to the woman he hates just to see if she could help. My Theory is that Davos is really the person that brought Jon back to life. When was trying she looked like she had no hope or no will. She gave up and everyone left the room except Davos. Davos walks up to Jon's body and I think he prays to the Lord of the Light and asks him to bring back his friend. Just a few seconds later Jon wakes up. I think to be able to bring someone back they have to be someone that you really care for.",gameofthrones,True,1533072274,2018-07-31

[SPOILERS] Some things I noticed about the difference between Season 7 and Seasons 1-4,"I'm one episode away from finishing Game of Thrones (binge watched it in three weeks).

Season 1-3 of Game of Thrones have a very tight and almost perfect script, with many shocking twists and great storytelling, though I agree that they have a very slow narration. Season 4 for me is the greatest TV Season ever put to screen. Season 5 has some great moments in it, though it also has some filler and Season 6, while not having a tight script like S1-4, has two of the greatest TV episodes I have ever seen.

A couple of episodes into Season 7, I realized that something was different.  
Not necessarily bad, but different.

NUMBER ONE:

The show's pacing increased drastically. I mean, everything Moves, really REALLY fast. Maybe that's because in former Seasons everything was built up so carefully and ""slow"" that we're used to a comparably more methodic narration.  
But the pacing really stole some of the uniqueness. 

In S1-6 there were 4 big action battles; Blackwater, Watchers on Wall, Hardhome &amp; Battle of the Bastards. Each of them was built of very carefully. Every episode on the various plot lines (Kings Landing, the Wall, Beyond the Wall, Winterfell) lead to this battle and culmination. 6 Episodes into Season 7 and there are already like 4 battle scenes and I wasn't nearly as invested as I was in the other 4.

NUMBER TWO:

Of course, Season 7 has some great fan service. All the different families and characters, finally meet or meet again. Like Sansa &amp; Arya, Tyrion &amp; Jaime, Davos &amp; that kid he rescued in Season 2/3, Jorah &amp; Daenerys etc. But I really think that all this fan service takes the room that was there for the character development in Season 1-4(-6) . I mean, no character is really developing. And some characters really feel obsolete nowadays, like Littlefinger, Brienne or Melisandre.

I think the show runners had a very tough task. The problem with having such a great and fantastic story is, that the story culmination should be equally great or even greater, which, it sadly isn't.

NUMBER THREE (and the most important one):

This, now, is hard to explain. I think the most fascinating thing about GoT Season 1-6 is that it completely transcended and put me into this world. Into the (hedonistic) world of GOT. I watched GoT, not being able to ""complain"" because I was so invested. The story felt so real, that I was interested in the CHARACTER actions, not in the writers decisions. When The Red Wedding happened, I cried for the characters I loved. I hated Joffrey so much, but I didn't hate the writers for making him such a Bastard. It was like, I never needed to be ""angry"" about the writers, because I was so invested in the show that made so much sense.

But the thing is, you can only be that invested in the show, if the writing is spot on perfect. And that doesn't mean that I don't like Fantasy and I only want the Political Thriller in GoT (which it obviously isn't in S7 - more like Dragons fighting another army of Dragons and stuff). Because well, The Lord of The Rings also put me into that world of theirs, and I just feel with the characters without thinking about the writing. 

The problem with Season 7 is that the script, indeed is flawed, or at least, can't match the script of the other Seasons. And as hard as I try to again go into that world and see the characters as characters and not actors, and their actions as their actions and not as the writers decisions, I fail, because there always is something that bothers me writing wise. 

  
Example Given. In former Seasons every little misstep of a character was punished. Every little mistake could cost their life. Ned Stark trusting Littlefinger, out of nowhere costed his life. Robb, Talisa &amp; Caitlyn not holding their promise - out of nowhere costing their life, even a character like Renly (who technically didn't make a mistake) was killed out of nowhere.

In Season 7 I feel like every major character is like invincible. As much as I love Jon Snow, he is acting like an idiot. Why doesn't he jump on the fuck'n dragon, but decides to fight the Undead. And then, he falls into this cold water, with numerous of these guys trying to kill him. Than somehow he escapes, and again, he has to fight against thousands of them. And then out of nowhere his uncle Benjin appears. Gives him his horse and somehow Jon can escape with this horse, though there still are like thousand of these dead guys. And Benjin only came to die. Like, what? That's called bad writing. That's called making your protagonist feel invincible, like shitting on all the merciless and consequent decisions you made in other Seasons.

[SPOILERS]How would the series have turned out differently if GRRM had done the 5 year jump?,"For those that aren't aware, after a Storm of Swords (Basically, after Season 4) GRRM was planning on doing a 5 year time jump. So the 4th book/Season 5 would have opened approximately 5 years after the end of Storm/Season 4. But due to not getting all of the characters in the places that he needed them, he wasn't able to do that, and just wrote the 4th book to take place right after.

It seems like a large majority of the series' issues have stemmed from this lack of a five year jump. It's a comparison that I make a lot, but with the first three books, you can really tell that GRRM had a plan. The first book in particular is so tight and focused, and it seems like GRRM is writing to fulfill his plan. But starting with the 4th book, it really feels like he's writing just to write and see what happens. It doesn't feel like he really had a grand plan anymore, and was just writing things to see what happened. 

If he had utilized the 5 year jump, how do you think the series would have turned out? Where would the characters be? For one, I definitely think that he would have finished the series by now. That may be wishful thinking, but he cranked the first three books out with two years in between each and if he was able to stick to his plan I don't think we would have had the *huge* droughts between the books that we got. In terms of character locations, one of the biggest ones that makes me think is Jon. He would have spent those 5 years being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, so it makes me wonder if he still would have been killed. ",gameofthrones,True,1533092883,2018-07-31

[Spoilers] Thoughts after reading “A Game of Thrones” for the first time,"Hey everyone, I’m reading the books for the first time(i’ve seen the show) and I saw someone else do something like this a couple weeks ago and everyone seemed to enjoy it, I happened to also be reading the books for the first time after being a fan of the show, and just wanted to share some things I personally noticed. I’m sure there are plenty of things I missed but I didn’t look anything up, this is just what intrigued me, I don’t want it to just be a list of all the differences.


Some things I noticed:

Dany has this dream/memory thing towards the end of the book, and normally I would think nothing of it, but GoT has some insane foreshadowing, so ill definitely keep this in mind


The white walkers being called “Others” was interesting, I don’t think it means too much, could be that the show didn’t want them to get confused with the “Others” from the tv show LOST, or maybe they’re going to be separate things and they were dumbed down for the show or something, idk, doesn’t seem like a huge deal just wanted to put it out there.


Jeyne pool was a decently important character it seems, she didn’t have a huge role, but in the show most characters have a couple lines or are at least mentioned, i’m surprised they just completely cut her from the show, especially earlier on when they were trying to stay true to the books. Maybe she’s part of a bigger storyline later on that they knew they wouldn’t have time for or something with budget maybe?


This one seemed like it could be important later, but I couldn’t really figure out anything about it, it’s just the three eyed raven being called a three eyed crow, I have really no idea why they changed it and what it means, I guess i’ll just find out as I read, nothing really for that one.


Jeor Mormonts crow was by far the most interesting change, everything else seems pretty subtle and like minor foreshadowing or something, but this seems like it be a major part of the books, I really didn’t understand it at all and i excited to find out more about it.


The last thing is a quote from Mirri Maz Dur, something about telling Dany her baby had been dead for years, which just doesn’t make any sense, I found nothing on google and a couple days ago posted about it and I got one answer to do with time travel, I didn’t look into because I don’t want spoilers but that would be crazy, idk could be nothing though.


Alright that was pretty much all I found, if you guys like this then i’ll do for the other books, takes me about a month each book though so be patient, probably even more so when school starts back up.
Also please no spoilers for further books(broad things are ok, like “this will be more important/explained later) but not blatant spoilers, and you can point out stuff I missed too if it’s important",gameofthrones,True,1533096485,2018-08-01

I'm going to put something out there that may not be well-received purely because I haven't read the books and don't know all of the information.

So, Littlefinger, yeah? Is it possible his ""plan"" the entire time was...nothing? What if his plan was to disrupt the kingdom so that he could take advantage, but never had an endgame for that chaos.

Is this at all possible? I know the show isn't the best representation of character, but Petyr never seemed like he had a plan, he always seemed like he was just taking advantage of the chaos however he could at that time.

If he always has a backup plan, then he never commits to his first plan, so isn't all of his time spent, you know, guessing? Just always teetering on the edge of what he might want and what he has to do instead. To me, it doesn't seem like a ""plan"" so much as good planning in the moment.

[SPOILERS] Thoughts on Jon Snow,"I know this has been discussed before but I was re-watching the series and I got to Season 6, Episode 3 where Jon Snow executes the Nights Watch who betrayed him and it left me unfulfilled.  

The scene just felt incredibly weak compared to what could have been done.  In the first episode of the series, we see Ned Stark execute a deserter from the Watch and he does so with his sword and a block.  He even says that the person passing the judgment should dole out the punishment.  I think thematically that it would make more sense for Jon to have done the same thing when he executed those who betrayed him.  

I also think that it would have done a lot to show the change in Jon Snow if the show runners are going that route at all.  I know GRRM has stated, and we have seen with Beric Dondarrion, that being resurrected has a tole.  A beheading is a much colder and personal way of executing the Watch members and it would feel uncharacteristic of Jon to do so.  That is why I believe it would have worked so well.

I am just curious what anyone else's thoughts are on the topic and maybe if the hanging does fit better for the story, someone could weigh in on why that is the case.

As an aside, it would have been incredibly bad ass if Jon had done the beheadings.  When the episode first aired, someone wrote and alternate version where Jon Snow says, ""Ed... fetch me the block.""  That has stuck with me since and so I may just be biased.

[SPOILERS] Regarding Arya Stark and her sword fighting post season 6.,"Hello all, long time lurker, first time poster! (not sure if this needs a spoiler tag, but wouldn't want to risk it!)

So, I have watched all of Game of Thrones a couple of times now (and the first two books) and one thing confuses me about Arya. We see from her time with Syrio that she learns a practical form of water dancing (and is ok at it), after she leaves harrenhal and escapes the Brotherhood, and joins the hound, we see her several times ""practising"" her water dancing, but i presume most of it is made up, since it is so unlike her training with Syrio, but is understandable considering it has been 2-3 years since she trained properly. finally, when she trains with the faceless men, she hides needle and the only fight training we see her get is with a staff (nothing like waterdancing, or rapier fighting). What confuses me is how she suddenly gets so badass with needle (as shown in her fight with Brienne in S7) is there anything in the later books or in the shows that describe her Faceless man training?, while not a big detail, as someone who practises HEMA, I do tend to overthink movie/tv sword fighting scenes. But am really curious as to how she is suddenly an expert in sword fighting, even though in universe she has not properly used one for about 4-5 years. thanks for any help you guys can give!",gameofthrones,True,1533138269,2018-08-01
[SPOILERS] Jon killers have a point,"Ok, sorry for the inflammatory title, I don’t fully believe that. But I have seen too many Ollie and Thorne haters that I had to say something. 

We are lead to believe (correctly) that Jon is doing a good thing by forgiving the old grudge between Westeros and the wildlings and creating an alliance to confront the real enemy which is the night king. 

However, those who don’t agree with Jon are not entirely without merit. The wall has stood for a thousand years and even when it was poorly manned with only 3 out of 21 castles guarded, the white walkers never dared to approach the wall. This was because the magic woven in the wall rebelled them. However the people of the north were always suffering from the wilding vicious raids and viewed the night watch as protection from the wildlings rather than from the unnatural beings north of the wall. 

So when some people like Thorne and Ollie refuse to accept the alliance with the wildling, they are not being blind to the white walker threat, they just believe that the wall will hold on like it did for thousands of years. And so such alliance was not necessary. 

If Jon has simply allowed the wildling to pass as refugees, and if Mance has come asking for help before attacking the wall. Thorne and the others may have sympathized and accepted it. But the problem was that Jon was treating them like honored allies. And in case of Ollie, he was doing so with those same wildling who butchered his family. You can not ask a kid to be understanding with those who murdered his mother. 

I think Jon carries a big part of the responsibility for failing to explain his position clearly and taking these sensitivities into account.he could have taken measures such as separating the wildling from the night watch quickly instead of surrounding himself with them, or insisting on punishing the few who committed crimes south of the wall to satisfy victims like Ollie. 

Don’t get me wrong, I know Jon position is correct, but those who opposed him were not total villains. I think after his resurrection he should have forgiven them in the spirit of needing every living person to fight the against the dead as he has forgiven the wildlings who attacked the wall.

[SPOILERS] How I predict Valyrian steel is made.,"I’m not sure if this is a popularly stated and accepted opinion, but I only see one possible answer to the question of how Valyrian steel is made.

I believe it is created by infusing the molten metal with molten dragonglass during the forging process.

The main reasoning being that dragonglass and Valyrian steel swords are the only two known weapons that can kill a white walker. 

Secondly, Dragonstone has a mine of the stuff, so they probably had the largest known supply more so than anyone else.

There’s also the interesting aspect of both Valyrian Steel and dragonglass that once the Doom of Valyria happened there was a loss of knowledge of both.

Using the real world Obsidian as a reference, I believe like Obsidian being formed by Volcanoes, dragon glass is formed by a massive blast of dragon fire. 

My last point is that I believe dragonfire is needed to melt the dragonglass to then be used in the Valyrian Steel process.

I’m not sure how John will come to discover this, maybe Sam will find it in a book, but I think more Valyrian Steel will be made in the last arc.

I loved every season, and can’t wait for season 8. The ending of season 7 with the night king destroying the wall was crazy. I want to read the books now, but are they worth it? I’ve heard that it’s a lot of reading, and I just wanted some opinions. Also, I don’t care about spoilers for the books that much since I’ve seen the show but how far ahead of the books is the show?",gameofthrones,True,1533156868,2018-08-01
"[SPOILERS] I know everyone is probably sick of _ + _ = J posts, but I have one I haven't seen before that I want your opinion on","So I've had this idea for awhile. I've searched around online and haven't seen anyone discuss it. Also haven't seen anyone talk about it on here. So I just wanna throw this out there and see what you all think.

N + L = J.

That's right. Ned plus Lyanna equals Jon.

As far as timelines and all that goes, I don't know if it is logistically possible. (I've only read the books once through so everything is kinda hazy). I know they were at the tourney of Harrenhal together but that's all I know for sure.

I like this theory for a few reasons:

First off, GRRM has made this whole TOJ scenario very ambiguous. There are many theories as to who Jon's parents could be. (There are even theories that there was no baby at all, the baby wasn't even Jon, or there were multiple babies). So for everyone to theorize pretty much every pairing possible except for this one....and then to have it turn out it's actually N + L = J all along...a possible coupling that was there that we didn't consider...it would be interesting and throw us off guard.

Secondly, N + L would obviously mean incest, as Ned and Lyanna are siblings. For Ned to be portrayed as such an honorable, moral-compass driven character, then to find out he was guilty of incestual relations, would be a mind-blowing reveal.

Thirdly, I really like the idea of Jon being a pureblood Stark. Even though he would still be a bastard, he would have more Stark blood than the other Stark children. An N + L = J reveal would be kinda awesome because for all his life, Jon has wanted to be a Stark. Then to have it revealed he's the MOST Stark of all? By blood at least, even if not in name? It would be cool.

Of course I know there are many things to negate this theory, and when it comes down to it most of the ""supporting evidence"" for the theory hangs on your interpretation of Ned's assumed brotherly affections for his sister. But I enjoy indulging in it nonethless. What are your thoughts on it?",gameofthrones,True,1533157443,2018-08-01

[SPOILERS] I have started to read the books...,"I am halfway through the first book, and it is a true masterpiece. There is so much more little details that the show missed out on. My favorite part of the  book so far is the developing friendship between Tyrion and Jon. Right before Tyrion leaves Castle Black, they both acknowledge each other and each other their first true friend. I thought this was a beautiful scene, them both being ""bastards"" and all. I also didn't know that Hodor had a great grandmother. Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think the show mentioned that the old nan was his grandmother. I have to re-watch the show for a third time. ",gameofthrones,True,1533159498,2018-08-01
[No Spoilers] A business idea,"So i posted this in a thread, sub: Riverrun castle for sale.. or something similar. Ive actually been considering this so i wanted to post on the main page. Im just going to copy paste

Lets all invest and turn it into a live castle GOT complete with people playing the part. It could be turned into a profitable business too, as you can charge a decent amount for the experience. GoT is fuckin huge, and the train aint stopping for a long time as prequel shows are gonna be made and its always going have a cult following in the future. Im sure the technicalities can be worked out and licencing from the corps will be hard to obtain and probably expensive. But i see this business as a franchise, maybe the next disneyland of amusement parks, but its gomma be ASOIAF.. I'll pay good money for that shit and im 31",gameofthrones,True,1533169876,2018-08-01
[Spoilers] GoT Ending?,"In season 1 Jamie tells Need the story of him killing the mad king. Jamie tells him he could have taken the iron throne for himself, but he let Robert Baratheon take it...
Will we see something like this again with Jamie killing the mad Queen and Jon walking in on this betrayal and denying the throne? Will he take the throne unlike Ned? Would Jon judge Jamie like Ned judged him? Will Jamie die shortly after in the arms  of the woman he loves? 

I feel like there are so many parallels that we are thinking will come through. But we seem to forget that everything the characters are doing bright now is to ""break the wheel"". It will be interesting to see what story lines come full circle and which ones do not.

"[SPOILERS] THE MEANING OF ICE AND FIRE, AND A LOVE STORY HIDDEN IN BLOOD."," I finished re-watching the whole series of Game of Thrones (as a distraction from the wait of season 8), and found a lot of evidence that Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen were on similar character arcs that were always leading toward each other. And not just that, but that maybe they are actually each a part of the Azor Ahai prophecy/the meaning of the series' title: A Song of Ice and Fire. This strictly show related. However, the show-runners of Game of Thrones have been told the ending of the series from the man himself, GRRM. So could this possibly be how the book is going to end???? Probably not, but you never know. These are also not my personal opinions. May include spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm not perfect, and some events may be slightly out of order. This was mainly for fun so read for enjoyment. I've broken down the evidence by season so (WARNING HEAVY SPOILERS FOR SEASONS 1-7):

**Season 1:**

**Before the series begins**:

•	*Prince/Princess who was promised prophecy (PWWP).*

\- 1/2. Born in sand amongst a bleeding star. This applies to Jon, as we find out in the finale of Season 6 that he was born in the desert region of Westeros called Dorne, while Sir Arthur Dayne's sword Dawn (forged from a falling star) sat beside him freshly covered in blood.

\- Jon's house sigil is a direwolf, a mythical creature. The Starks have pet dire-wolves in the series (although this was the first time on record of this occurring). Jon and the Starks are Ice.

\- 2/2. Born amongst salt and smoke. This applies to Daenerys (Dany), as she was born on Dragonstone, a smoky island off the coast of King's Landing that was the original seat of Aegon the Conqueror and House Targaryen.

\- Dany's family sigil is a dragon, a mythical creature. Their families could ride dragons. Dany and the Targaryens are Fire.

•	*Had mother's who died during childbirth.*

\- Lyanna Stark died giving birth to Jon.

\- Rhaella Targaryen died giving birth to Dany.

•	*Were hidden at birth and raised in secret.*

\- Jon was raised as the son of Ned Stark, in order to keep the secret that his parents are really Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.

\- Dany was moved from place to place as a child, along with her older brother Viserys, in order to avoid assassins sent by King Robert Baratheon.

•	*Can trace their lineage to the Mad king.*

\- Jon is his grandson.

\- Dany is his daughter.

**Series begins:** 

\- Jon leaves his Stark home of Winterfell, and decides to join the Night's Watch, a group that defends the Wall from any threats beyond it.

•	*Leave their homes and join a new group*.

\- Dany (begrudgingly) agrees to marry Khal Drogo, the head of a very large Dothraki khalasar, and to join the Dothraki as the khalasar's version of a queen..

•	*Begin to thrive in their new groups.*

\- Jon proves that he is much more skilled than any other new recruit, begins training the new recruits, and is named the steward to the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont. This sets up Jon to be a strong candidate for the next Lord Commander.

\- Dany forms a real love and partnership with Drogo, learns the Dothraki language, controls some of their customs and adopts their policies, gains confidence in her role, and grows stronger, even standing up to her abusive brother.

•	*Form a valuable friendship.*

\- Jon with Samwell Tarly, a smart but naive recruit and Jon's first friend in the Night's Watch.

\- Dany with Ser Jorah Mormont as a sell-sword/bodyguard from Westeros.

•	*Survive a near-death experience.*

\- Jon stops a white that attacks him and his direwolf Ghost inside a Night's Watch tower. This marks the first appearance of a white inside the Wall.

\- Dany is almost poisoned by a wine merchant, but is luckily saved by Ser Jorah.

•	*Say goodbye to two people close to them.*

\- Jon receives news that Ned Stark, his ""father"", has been beheaded in King's Landing. Then, his ""uncle"" who is also in the Night's Watch, Benjen Stark, goes missing during a ranging mission. Benjen is presumed dead, and is not seen again until the end of Season 7 as a half-white. 

\- Dany loses Viserys and Khal Drogo. After multiple offenses to both Dany and the Dothraki, Khal Drogo pours molten gold onto the head of her brother Viserys, killing him instantly. Then, Drogo suffers from an infected cut and the blood-magic of a scorned witch, which leads to his death.

•	*Given powerful weapons.*

\- Jon, receives a Valyrian steel sword from Jeor Mormont after saving his life from the white. Valyrian steel is the strongest and lightest steel in the world, and only a few swords remain in the Seven-Kingdoms.

\- In the Season 1 finale, Dany manages to hatch three baby dragons from petrified eggs, by climbing into Drogo's funeral pyre. Creatures who were thought to have been extinct for over one-hundred years.

•	*Start journeys of Ice and Fire.*

\- Jon, and his fellow Night's Watch members start a journey to the icy, cold, deep-north, in order to find out what has been happening beyond the wall. Rumors swirl of white-walker sightings, and of the largest wild-ling army to ever exist.

\- Dany, after hatching her dragons, takes her remaining khalasar into the hot, desert terrain, to find a place to keep them safe and plan her next move towards retaking her home and all of Westeros.

**Season 2:**

•	*Trekking through a wasteland.*

\- Jon, and his weather-torn group, are looking for reports of the largest wildling army to ever exist. As well as suitable shelter to escape the fierce ice and cold.

\- Dany, and her weather-torn group, looking for shelter from the fierce heat and fire of the Red Waste.

•	*Enjoy their new roles.*

\- Jon also begins to come into his own as a Night's Watch member. He's volunteering for duties, teaching new recruits, and no longer carrying a chip on his shoulder.

\- Dany begins to come into her own as leader of her khalasar. The shy girl from the first season is almost gone.

•	*Opposite sex advances.*

\- While Jon is on a scouting mission, he comes across a few wild-lings. One is a female named Ygritte, who Jon takes captive. While captive, Ygritte makes many sexual advances toward Jon, and every time she is rejected.

\- When Dany makes it to the end of the Red Waste, she is invited into a city called Qarth. Within Qarth thirteen members make up a council that together rule the city. One member is man known as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, or the Spice King. Daxos proposes marriage to Dany many times, and every time he is rejected.

•	*Taken captive*.

\- While Jon has Ygritte captive, she manages to escape, lure Jon into an ambush, and take him as her prisoner.

\- While a guest within Qarth, warlocks use magic and betrayal to steal Dany's dragons and lure her into their tower of a hideout. Once within the tower and past her visions (will discuss next), she is put into chains by the warlocks. She manages to escape by having her three dragons burn the warlock in front of her.

•	*Gain knowledge from enemies*.

\- Jon and his group come to a house known as Craster's Keep, belonging to a man known for housing the Night's Watch north of the Wall. Jon comes to find out that Craster marries all his daughter's, they have his children, and the cycle repeats. If that wasn't bad enough, he then finds out Craster has been giving all of his son's to the White-Walkers (WW), as a sacrifice so they would leave him in peace.

\- When Dany first enters the warlocks' tower, she begins to have visions. One is of King's Landing , only it's ruined and covered in snowy ash. (Possibly foreshadowing the series finale?????) After Dany escapes the visions and is put into chains, the warlocks' explain to tell her that her dragons are the source of the warlock's restored magic. Meaning it's possible her dragons brought magic back into the world.

•	*Make a bold decision and head into the unknown.*

\- Now that Jon is a wild-ling captive, he makes the choice to go undercover and infiltrate the supposed ""largest wild-ling army ever"", by killing a fellow Night's Watchmen, Qhorin Half-Hand (Qhorin's idea). By doing so, the wild-lings believe he is a true deserter of the Night's Watch, keeping his cover for now.

\- After getting revenge on those within Qarth who plotted to steal her dragons and potentially harm her, Dany decides to take the now deceased Spice King's ships deeper into Essos towards Astapor and Slaver's Bay. This decision is bold because Dany doesn't know much about Essos and it's lands, and also it's the opposite direction of Westeros and the Iron Throne, Dany's ultimate goal.

**Season 3:**

•	*Pretend to be naive and but up a powerful bluff.*

\- In the deep North, Jon is under watch by the wild-lings, as few truly believe he has left the Night's Watch. His bluff is working, for now.

\- Once is Astapor, Dany meets a slaver who frequently insults her in Valyrian. Little does he know Valyrian is Dany's native tongue, and Dany uses this to her advantage. Dany strikes up a bargain with the slaver: one dragon for eight-thousand Unsullied soldiers. Some of the fiercest warriors in the world. Dany is told by many not to make the deal, as a dragon is too powerful, but she is confident in her decision. When the time comes to make the deal, Dany commands one of her dragons to kill the slave-master, and takes the Unsullied for her own.

•	*Overcome a large obstacle.*

\- As a wild-ling, Jon and a small group are tasked with climbing the Wall itself. After almost falling on the way up, Jon survives the climb, largely with the help of Ygritte.

\- After Astapor, Dany sets her sights on the city of Yunkai. The Yunkai send sell-swords named the Second Sons to fight Dany's army, and one in particular named Daario Naharis to kill Dany. Daario decides to instead join Dany, and with his help, Dany's army conquers Yunkai.

•	*Intimate relationships.*

\- After the thrill of conquering the Wall, Jon and Ygritte start an intimate relationship, but this one becomes serious. They form a relationship based on real love.

\- Dany feels an initial attraction to Daario, and although they don't officially hook-up until Season 4, they form a ""friends-with-benefits"" relationship. Her first since the death of Drogo at the end of Season 1.

•	*Begin to become true leaders.*

\- After escaping the wild-ling camp, and taking multiple arrows from Ygritte and his way out, Jon makes it back to the Wall and Castle Black. The first time in two seasons. He is now battle-tested, knows the wild-lings, and is ready to become a leader when his men need him most.

\- Dany has now conquered and liberated two cities. She has three dragons, an army, and thousands of former slaves following her. The freed slaves have even taken to calling her ""mhysa"", which means Mother. She is becoming a queen.

**Season 4:**

•	*Fight for a moral high-ground.*

\- Now that Jon has returned to The Wall, he is immediately faced with a problem. While Jon was undercover with the wild-lings, the Night's Watch party he began with were attacked by whites. The surviving men went to Craster's Keep, and while there, led a mutiny that resulted in Craster's death. As well as the death of their own Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont. Jon volunteers to take down the mutiny on the moral obligation to get revenge for his Lord Commander, but also because Jon grossly exaggerated the numbers of the Night's Watch. If the wild-lings make it to Crater's Keep and find out the real numbers, the wild-lings would attack the Wall and easily take it.

\- Dany has now conquered two cities in Slaver's Bay, and makes her way towards a third, the city of Meereen. After approaching the city, and having Daario Naharis defeat Meereen's champion outside the city gates, Dany launches the collars of all the slaves she has already freed into the city. This sends a message that she is done with slavery, and anyone who joins her will never again be put into chains.

•	*Answer injustice with justice.*

\- As mentioned above, Jon is on the way to put down the mutiny at Craster's. And as much as this was done to make sure the Night's Watch members there don't tell any wild-lings their true numbers, this was also done to get justice for Jeor. Jeor made Jon his steward, gifted him a Valyrian steel sword, mentored him like a father, and helped him grow into a man and a leader. Jon wants to avenge Jeor, and get some kind of justice against his fellow Night's Watch members that killed their own leader.

\- Dany dispatches her Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen, start a slave revolt, and then open the city gates for the rest of her army. The plan works, and the city is hers. She then has 163 Great Masters killed, in response to the 163 children that were killed and strung-up along the path from Yunkai to Meereen.

•	*Forced to cage their beasts*.

\- While putting down the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Jon reunites with his direwolf Ghost, who he had not seen since being capture by wild-lings in Season 2. But once he returns to Castle Black, he is ordered by Alliser Thorne, a high-raking member of the Watch that also hates Jon, to cage Ghost. Or risk it becoming food for the men.

\- While in Meereen, a shepherd brings Dany the bones of his daughter, who was accidentally killed by her largest Dragon, Drogon. In response, Dany agrees to cage her dragons under the Great Pyramid of Meereen. She isn't able to catch Drogon, so only her other two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, are successfully caged.

**Season 5:**

•	*Tempted by lineage.*

\- After the remaining wild-ling army was smashed by Lord Stannis Baratheon, the younger brother of former King Robert and technically the true king of Westeros , Stannis takes refuge at Castle Black. While there he makes Jon an offer, join him and rise as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. After some consideration, Jon declines, stating he made a vow to the Night's Watch.

\- Meereen is growing chaotic. Former slaves and masters are constantly fighting, and a secret organization known as the Sons of the Harpy are killing Unsullied soldiers. One such Harpy is found, and Dany at first wants the man executed. Her adviser, Ser Barristan Selmy, argues the man should have a trial. He then warns her of how her father, the Mad-King, acted. He went for execution over trial, and soon lost himself inside his own murderous desires.

•	*Granted official titles.*

\- At Castle Black, it's now time to elect a new Lord Commander. At first, Alliser Thorne is the clear favorite and seems to have the election locked up. But then Samwell Tarly gives a passionate speech for Jon, and it's enough to sway his fellow men, leading Jon to become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch

\- In order to keep the piece in Meereen, Dany agrees to marry a noble from one of the city's most well-known houses, Hizdahr zo Loraq. Through this marriage, she is officially the Queen of Meereen, to those who already saw her this way and to the nobles who refused her claim..

•	*Working with different groups isn't easy.*

\- Things at Castle Black aren't going so well. Lord Stannis expects his troops taken care of, and is even trying to recruit wild-lings to his cause, a move that upsets the Night's Watch. The Night's Watch want revenge against any remaining wild-lings. The wild-lings that survived want revenge against the Night's Watch. And members of the Night's Watch are growing uneasy with: their new Lord Commander, lack of men and supplies, and wild-lings and Stannis' men always around them. This comes to a blow when Janos Slynt, the man responsible for betraying New Stark back in Season 1, publicly refuses the orders given by Jon. Jon responds by publicly executing Slynt, a move that pleases some and angers others.

\- Meereen is still at odds. Former slaves hate former masters, and vice versa. One slave murders the man that Dany wanted to put on trial. To try and fix the situation, Dany has that slave publicly executed. The other former slaves immediately turn on her, and any masters preset. Neither group is any happier, and worst now Dany has lost members from the one group that was originally with her.

•	*Working with the enemy.*

\- Jon must also work with his enemies. The Wall needs more men, and one of Jon's duties is to ask the lords of Westeros to send anyone they can spare. This includes Roose Bolton, the current warden of the North who betrayed the Starks and stole Winterfell. At first Jon refuses to send a letter to Roose, but is reminded the Night's Watch remains neutral. So he reluctantly asks. His next move is even bolder, he plans to allow the wild-lings to pass through the Wall and settle in the North as subjects of the Seven Kingdoms, or even let them join the Watch. Jon's idea is met with harsh criticism, but he points out that every single wildling left on the north side of the Wall will be killed, then resurrected, and then added to the White Walkers ever-growing army. Jon then leads a rescue mission to a place beyond-the-wall called Hardhome, in order to save wild-lings who were separated during Stannis' attack. The mission is a success, however; bringing even more wild-lings into Castle Black does not go over well with many of the Night's Watch.

\- As mentioned above, Dany marries a noblemen in order to better unite Meereen. And she also agrees to re-open the fighting pits to freedman only, something she has constantly been against. This move is a way of showing the masters she can respect their old traditions. And during her fist visit to a fighting pit practice exhibition, she is given a gift, Tyrion Lannister. All Dany knows of house Lannister is that they played a role in casting out her family, so naturally Tyrion is first seen as an enemy. But after some discussion, Dany agrees to allow Tyrion to counsel her. His knowledge of ruling and of Westeros are of great value.

•	*Consequences of one's actions.*

\- The night Jon returns from Hardhome, his squire Olly comes and tells him one of the wild-lings knows of the whereabouts of his uncle Benjen Stark, who has been missing since Season 1. Jon goes down and follows Thorne to a gathering of his Watch brothers, only to find a sign marked ""Traitor"". Thorne, Olly, and other members of the Night's Watch begin to stab Jon, each saying ""For the Watch"". Jon siding with the wild-lings may have been the right decision, but men who have fought them all their lives did not seen it this way. Jon collapses and seemingly dies from his wounds, bleeding out onto the cold snow.

\- Dany is in attendance at the official opening of the fighting pits. Lately things in Meereen have cooled down, and everyone has relaxed their guard. Suddenly, Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering both masters and freedmen alike – Hizdahr included. The new found peace was simply a distraction for this main attack. Dany and her companions are pushed toward the center of the pit, and just when they look to be in trouble, Drogon swoops down, defends Dany, and then leaves with her to an unknown location. Her city is at war again, this time without its queen.

**Season 6:**

•	*Both are reborn, new, and improved?*

\- Jon was last seen bleeding out from his wounds delivered by his fellow Night's Watch members. The worst happens, and Jon dies. But Ser Davos isn't giving up. He enlists the help of the Red Witch Melisandre, to see if she can resurrect him. She is reluctant, but tries anyways. She preforms her spell, and it looks like it failed. But as everyone is leaving, Jon Snow opens his eyes, alive once again. His death also allows him to leave the Night's Watch, as his vows end now that he has died.

\- After Drogon takes Dany away from Meereen, she is met by a massive Dothraki khalasar. She is taken prisoner, but once it's discovered she was married to a Khal, she is told she must join the Dosh Khalleen. A group of all the wives of fallen Khals. This doesn't sit well with Dany. All the Khals from across the land are gathered in their city Vaes Dothrak, and are deciding if Dany is allowed to join the Khalleen. Dany has another idea. She traps the Khals inside their meeting hut, sets the place on fire killing them all, and emerges reborn from fire once again as Daenerys Targaryen, the Unburnt.

•	*Revenge.*

\- A newly resurrected Jon has to take care of some unfinished business. The Night's Watchmen who killed him had all been captured, and were to face justice. Jon offers Thorne, Olly, and two other men a chance for any last words, and then has all four publicly hung. Revenge is his, even if it isn't so sweet.

\- As mentioned above, Dany kills all the former Khals. They took her prisoner, insulted her, would have raped her, abused her, and would have made her remain a Dosh Khalleen. Her revenge was swift and powerful.

•	*Form a new army.*

\- Now that Jon is no longer apart of the Night's Watch, he isn't sure what to do. That changes when his ""sister"", Sansa Stark, arrives at Castle Black. She informs him that she ran from Winterfell, where she was married to the abusive Ramsay Bolton, and that his forces are looking for her. They eventually devise a plan to take back Winterfell, and defeat the Boltons. To do so, Jon and his allies ask any northern lords who haven't joined the Boltons to fight with him, as well as the wild-lings. Some agree, and an army is formed, but one smaller than they need.

\- Once Dany burns all the Khals, she asks all the Dothraki to join her and her cause. They all agree, and suddenly Dany has a much larger force.

•	*Fight for their future.*

\- Jon, and his out-numbered men, get ready to battle the Bolton's army for control of the North. They have a plan to make up for their lack of men, but that goes away once Ramsay releases Jon's youngest ""brother"" Rickon and has him run across the battlefield, while he shoots arrows at him. Jon makes it feet away from Rickon, right before an arrow hits and kills him. Enraged, Jon attacks the whole army, and his men follow. The battle is fierce, but it seems Ramsay has led Jon into a trap. Right when hope is lost, Sansa comes in with the Knights of the Vale and smash Ramsay's forces. Jon follows a fleeing Ramsay to Winterfell, and proceeds to beat the living crap out of Ramsay. The battle is won, and once again Starks rule Winterfell. 

\- While Dany has been gone, Tyrion has ruled Meereen in her place. He's a good ruler, but not as threatening as ""the mother of dragons"". So finally, all the slavers from Slaver's Bay begin an assault on Meereen. Just then, Dany and Drogon arrive and ready for battle. With a newly freed Rhaegal and Viserion, Dany and her three dragons begin burning the Slaver's fleet. They quickly begin retreating, but a message must be sent, so Dany has 2/3 of the former high-masters executed, and tells the third to spread the tale of what happened here. Of what happened when slavery tried to return to Meereen. 

•	*Begin a new chapter, stronger than ever.*

\- With the battle won the North is safe, and a Stark once again holds the North and Winterfell. Now they must figure out what's next. A lot of powerful, northern houses have been hurt in the constant warfare, and someone needs to lead. Lyanna Mormont, the new leader of House Mormont, stands and makes a case for Jon Snow. Although he's a Snow, he's still a Stark, and for the most part a Stark has always ruled the North. This fact, and Jon's proven merit, sway the other lords in attendance, and soon chants of ""the White Wolf"" and ""King of the North"" are shouted by almost everyone. Jon hesitantly, accepts the honor, out of duty and not for personal glory. A new chapter begins, and from a bastard to King of the North! 

\- Now that the slavers have been put down, ships and soldiers are plentiful, and the dragons are battle-ready, Dany is ready to set sail for Westeros. She has three dragons, and Unsullied army, a Dothraki horde, and alliances with both House Tyrell and Martell, two old and respected houses in Westeros. A new chapter begins, one that finally has Dany in Westeros!

**Season 7:**

•	*Plan for the future.*

\- Now as King of the North, Jon has more responsibility than ever. But the biggest threat is still that beyond the Wall, the WWs. Jon begins planning his tactics, one of which is convincing those in Westeros that the threat is even real.

\- Now in Westeros, Dany plans to fight for the Iron Throne, and the Lannisters are her target. With all her strength at the ready, she and her advisers plan for war. 

•	*End of similarities (mostly), because the meeting is here!*

\- Dany is advised to invite Jon to Dragonstone, as he is gaining quite a reputation. 

\- Jon agrees and he and Davos make the journey. 

\- Jon arrives, and Ice and Fire are officially united!!!!!!!!!! 

\- Instantly the contrasts in styles are on full display. Jon is relaxed and focused on the bigger threat (Ice), while 

 Dany is aggressive and more power-hungry (Fire).

\- Both at some point in the season go into battle, and each put themselves on the front-line. 

Over the course of the rest of the season, their bond grows stronger. And finally, in the season finale, they hook up for the first time. This sets the stage for a wedding, and maybe even a child in Season 8?

That's all! A lot of info, but after seeing all their similarities it seems very much like Jon and Dany are the embodiment of Ice and Fire. I'm not sure how the book will deal with the Azor Ahai prophecy, but it seems like the show is simplifying it, and making Jon and Dany each a half of the prophecy. It works! And who knows, this could all be right. Or completely wrong. Just my interpretation of the material. Thanks for the read! ",gameofthrones,True,1533188524,2018-08-02
"[SPOILERS] The meaning of Fire and Ice, and a love story hidden in blood.","I finished re-watching the whole series of Game of Thrones (as a distraction from the wait of season 8), and found a lot of evidence that Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen were on similar character arcs that were always leading toward each other. And not just that, but that maybe they are actually each a part of the Azor Ahai prophecy/the meaning of the series' title: A Song of Ice and Fire. This strictly show related. However, the show-runners of Game of Thrones have been told the ending of the series from the man himself, GRRM. So could this possibly be how the book is going to end???? Probably not, but you never know. These are also not my personal opinions. May include spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm not perfect, and some events may be slightly out of order. This was mainly for fun so read for enjoyment. I've broken down the evidence by season so (WARNING HEAVY SPOILERS FOR SEASONS 1-7):

**Season 1:**

**Before the series begins**:

* *Prince/Princess who was promised prophecy (PWWP).*

\- 1/2. Born in sand amongst a bleeding star. This applies to Jon, as we find out in the finale of Season 6 that he was born in the desert region of Westeros called Dorne, while Sir Arthur Dayne's sword Dawn (forged from a falling star) sat beside him freshly covered in blood.

\- Jon's house sigil is a direwolf, a mythical creature. The Starks have pet dire-wolves in the series (although this was the first time on record of this occurring). Jon and the Starks are Ice.

\- 2/2. Born amongst salt and smoke. This applies to Daenerys (Dany), as she was born on Dragonstone, a smoky island off the coast of King's Landing that was the original seat of Aegon the Conqueror and House Targaryen.

\- Dany's family sigil is a dragon, a mythical creature. Their families could ride dragons. Dany and the Targaryens are Fire.

* *Had mother's who died during childbirth.*

\- Lyanna Stark died giving birth to Jon.

\- Rhaella Targaryen died giving birth to Dany.

* *Were hidden at birth and raised in secret.*

\- Jon was raised as the son of Ned Stark, in order to keep the secret that his parents are really Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.

\- Dany was moved from place to place as a child, along with her older brother Viserys, in order to avoid assassins sent by King Robert Baratheon.

* *Can trace their lineage to the Mad king.*

\- Jon is his grandson.

\- Dany is his daughter.

**Series begins:** 

* *Leave their homes and join a new group*.

\- Jon leaves his Stark home of Winterfell, and decides to join the Night's Watch, a group that defends the Wall from any threats beyond it.

\- Dany (begrudgingly) agrees to marry Khal Drogo, the head of a very large Dothraki khalasar, and to join the Dothraki as the khalasar's version of a queen..

* *Begin to thrive in their new groups.*

\- Jon proves that he is much more skilled than any other new recruit, begins training the new recruits, and is named the steward to the Lord Commander himself, Jeor Mormont. This sets up Jon to be a strong candidate for the next Lord Commander.

\- Dany forms a real love and partnership with Drogo, learns the Dothraki language, controls some of their customs and adopts their policies, gains confidence in her role, and grows stronger, even standing up to her abusive brother.

* *Form a valuable friendship.*

\- Jon with Samwell Tarly, a smart but naive recruit and Jon's first friend in the Night's Watch.

\- Dany with Ser Jorah Mormont as a sell-sword/bodyguard from Westeros.

* *Survive a near-death experience.*

\- Jon stops a white that attacks him and his direwolf Ghost inside a Night's Watch tower. This marks the first appearance of a white inside the Wall.

\- Dany is almost poisoned by a wine merchant, but is luckily saved by Ser Jorah.

* *Say goodbye to two people close to them.*

\- Jon receives news that Ned Stark, his ""father"", has been beheaded in King's Landing. Then, his ""uncle"" who is also in the Night's Watch, Benjen Stark, goes missing during a ranging mission. Benjen is presumed dead, and is not seen again until the end of Season 7 as a half-white. 

\- Dany loses Viserys and Khal Drogo. After multiple offenses to both Dany and the Dothraki, Khal Drogo pours molten gold onto the head of her brother Viserys, killing him instantly. Then, Drogo suffers from an infected cut and the blood-magic of a scorned witch, which leads to his death.

* *Given powerful weapons*

\- Jon, receives a Valyrian steel sword from Jeor Mormont after saving his life from the white. Valyrian steel is the strongest and lightest steel in the world, and only a few swords remain in the Seven-Kingdoms.

\- In the Season 1 finale, Dany manages to hatch three baby dragons from petrified eggs, by climbing into Drogo's funeral pyre. Creatures who were thought to have been extinct for over one-hundred years.

* *Start journeys of Ice and Fire.*

\- Jon, and his fellow Night's Watch members start a journey to the icy, cold, deep-north, in order to find out what has been happening beyond the wall. Rumors swirl of white-walker sightings, and of the largest wild-ling army to ever exist.

\- Dany, after hatching her dragons, takes her remaining khalasar into the hot, desert terrain, to find a place to keep them safe and plan her next move towards retaking her home and all of Westeros.

**Season 2:**

* *Trekking through a wasteland.*

\- Jon, and his weather-torn group, are looking for reports of the largest wildling army to ever exist. As well as suitable shelter to escape the fierce ice and cold.

\- Dany, and her weather-torn group, looking for shelter from the fierce heat and fire of the Red Waste.

* *Enjoy their new roles.*

\- Jon also begins to come into his own as a Night's Watch member. He's volunteering for duties, teaching new recruits, and no longer carrying a chip on his shoulder.

\- Dany begins to come into her own as leader of her khalasar. The shy girl from the first season is almost gone.

* *Opposite sex advances.*

\- While Jon is on a scouting mission, he comes across a few wild-lings. One is a female named Ygritte, who Jon takes captive. While captive, Ygritte makes many sexual advances toward Jon, and every time she is rejected.

\- When Dany makes it to the end of the Red Waste, she is invited into a city called Qarth. Within Qarth thirteen members make up a council that together rule the city. One member is man known as Xaro Xhoan Daxos, or the Spice King. Daxos proposes marriage to Dany many times, and every time he is rejected.

* *Taken captive*.

\- While Jon has Ygritte captive, she manages to escape, lure Jon into an ambush, and take him as her prisoner.

\- While a guest within Qarth, warlocks use magic and betrayal to steal Dany's dragons and lure her into their tower of a hideout. Once within the tower and past her visions (will discuss next), she is put into chains by the warlocks. She manages to escape by having her three dragons burn the warlock in front of her.

* *Gain knowledge from enemies*.

\- Jon and his group come to a house known as Craster's Keep, belonging to a man known for housing the Night's Watch north of the Wall. Jon comes to find out that Craster marries all his daughter's, they have his children, and the cycle repeats. If that wasn't bad enough, he then finds out Craster has been giving all of his son's to the White-Walkers (WW), as a sacrifice so they would leave him in peace.

\- When Dany first enters the warlocks' tower, she begins to have visions. One is of King's Landing , only it's ruined and covered in snowy ash. (Possibly foreshadowing the series finale?????) After Dany escapes the visions and is put into chains, the warlocks' explain to tell her that her dragons are the source of the warlock's restored magic. Meaning it's possible her dragons brought magic back into the world.

* *Make a bold decision and head into the unknown.*

\- Now that Jon is a wild-ling captive, he makes the choice to go undercover and infiltrate the supposed ""largest wild-ling army ever"", by killing a fellow Night's Watchmen, Qhorin Half-Hand (Qhorin's idea). By doing so, the wild-lings believe he is a true deserter of the Night's Watch, keeping his cover for now.

\- After getting revenge on those within Qarth who plotted to steal her dragons and potentially harm her, Dany decides to take the now deceased Spice King's ships deeper into Essos towards Astapor and Slaver's Bay. This decision is bold because Dany doesn't know much about Essos and it's lands, and also it's the opposite direction of Westeros and the Iron Throne, Dany's ultimate goal.

**Season 3:**

* *Pretend to be naive and but up a powerful bluff.*

\- In the deep North, Jon is under watch by the wild-lings, as few truly believe he has left the Night's Watch. His bluff is working, for now.

\- Once is Astapor, Dany meets a slaver who frequently insults her in Valyrian. Little does he know Valyrian is Dany's native tongue, and Dany uses this to her advantage. Dany strikes up a bargain with the slaver: one dragon for eight-thousand Unsullied soldiers. Some of the fiercest warriors in the world. Dany is told by many not to make the deal, as a dragon is too powerful, but she is confident in her decision. When the time comes to make the deal, Dany commands one of her dragons to kill the slave-master, and takes the Unsullied for her own.

* *Overcome a large obstacle.*

\- As a wild-ling, Jon and a small group are tasked with climbing the Wall itself. After almost falling on the way up, Jon survives the climb, largely with the help of Ygritte.

\- After Astapor, Dany sets her sights on the city of Yunkai. The Yunkai send sell-swords named the Second Sons to fight Dany's army, and one in particular named Daario Naharis to kill Dany. Daario decides to instead join Dany, and with his help, Dany's army conquers Yunkai.

* *Intimate relationships.*

\- After the thrill of conquering the Wall, Jon and Ygritte start an intimate relationship, but this one becomes serious. They form a relationship based on real love.

\- Dany feels an initial attraction to Daario, and although they don't officially hook-up until Season 4, they form a ""friends-with-benefits"" relationship. Her first since the death of Drogo at the end of Season 1.

* *Begin to become true leaders.*

\- After escaping the wild-ling camp, and taking multiple arrows from Ygritte and his way out, Jon makes it back to the Wall and Castle Black. The first time in two seasons. He is now battle-tested, knows the wild-lings, and is ready to become a leader when his men need him most.

\- Dany has now conquered and liberated two cities. She has three dragons, an army, and thousands of former slaves following her. The freed slaves have even taken to calling her ""mhysa"", which means Mother. She is becoming a queen.

**Season 4:**

* *Fight for a moral high-ground.*

\- Now that Jon has returned to The Wall, he is immediately faced with a problem. While Jon was undercover with the wild-lings, the Night's Watch party he began with were attacked by whites. The surviving men went to Craster's Keep, and while there, led a mutiny that resulted in Craster's death. As well as the death of their own Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont. Jon volunteers to take down the mutiny on the moral obligation to get revenge for his Lord Commander, but also because Jon grossly exaggerated the numbers of the Night's Watch. If the wild-lings make it to Crater's Keep and find out the real numbers, the wild-lings would attack the Wall and easily take it.

\- Dany has now conquered two cities in Slaver's Bay, and makes her way towards a third, the city of Meereen. After approaching the city, and having Daario Naharis defeat Meereen's champion outside the city gates, Dany launches the collars of all the slaves she has already freed into the city. This sends a message that she is done with slavery, and anyone who joins her will never again be put into chains.

* *Answer injustice with justice.*

\- As mentioned above, Jon is on the way to put down the mutiny at Craster's. And as much as this was done to make sure the Night's Watch members there don't tell any wild-lings their true numbers, this was also done to get justice for Jeor. Jeor made Jon his steward, gifted him a Valyrian steel sword, mentored him like a father, and helped him grow into a man and a leader. Jon wants to avenge Jeor, and get some kind of justice against his fellow Night's Watch members that killed their own leader.

\- Dany dispatches her Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen, start a slave revolt, and then open the city gates for the rest of her army. The plan works, and the city is hers. She then has 163 Great Masters killed, in response to the 163 children that were killed and strung-up along the path from Yunkai to Meereen.

* *Forced to cage their beasts*.

\- While putting down the mutiny at Craster's Keep, Jon reunites with his direwolf Ghost, who he had not seen since being capture by wild-lings in Season 2. But once he returns to Castle Black, he is ordered by Alliser Thorne, a high-raking member of the Watch that also hates Jon, to cage Ghost. Or risk it becoming food for the men.

\- While in Meereen, a shepherd brings Dany the bones of his daughter, who was accidentally killed by her largest Dragon, Drogon. In response, Dany agrees to cage her dragons under the Great Pyramid of Meereen. She isn't able to catch Drogon, so only her other two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, are successfully caged.

**Season 5:**

* *Tempted by lineage.*

\- After the remaining wild-ling army was smashed by Lord Stannis Baratheon, the younger brother of former King Robert and technically the true king of Westeros , Stannis takes refuge at Castle Black. While there he makes Jon an offer, join him and rise as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. After some consideration, Jon declines, stating he made a vow to the Night's Watch.

\- Meereen is growing chaotic. Former slaves and masters are constantly fighting, and a secret organization known as the Sons of the Harpy are killing Unsullied soldiers. One such Harpy is found, and Dany at first wants the man executed. Her adviser, Ser Barristan Selmy, argues the man should have a trial. He then warns her of how her father, the Mad-King, acted. He went for execution over trial, and soon lost himself inside his own murderous desires.

* *Granted official titles.*

\- At Castle Black, it's now time to elect a new Lord Commander. At first, Alliser Thorne is the clear favorite and seems to have the election locked up. But then Samwell Tarly gives a passionate speech for Jon, and it's enough to sway his fellow men, leading Jon to become the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch

\- In order to keep the piece in Meereen, Dany agrees to marry a noble from one of the city's most well-known houses, Hizdahr zo Loraq. Through this marriage, she is officially the Queen of Meereen, to those who already saw her this way and to the nobles who refused her claim..

* *Working with different groups isn't easy.*

\- Things at Castle Black aren't going so well. Lord Stannis expects his troops taken care of, and is even trying to recruit wild-lings to his cause, a move that upsets the Night's Watch. The Night's Watch want revenge against any remaining wild-lings. The wild-lings that survived want revenge against the Night's Watch. And members of the Night's Watch are growing uneasy with: their new Lord Commander, lack of men and supplies, and wild-lings and Stannis' men always around them. This comes to a blow when Janos Slynt, the man responsible for betraying New Stark back in Season 1, publicly refuses the orders given by Jon. Jon responds by publicly executing Slynt, a move that pleases some and angers others.

\- Meereen is still at odds. Former slaves hate former masters, and vice versa. One slave murders the man that Dany wanted to put on trial. To try and fix the situation, Dany has that slave publicly executed. The other former slaves immediately turn on her, and any masters preset. Neither group is any happier, and worst now Dany has lost members from the one group that was originally with her.

* *Working with the enemy.*

\- Jon must also work with his enemies. The Wall needs more men, and one of Jon's duties is to ask the lords of Westeros to send anyone they can spare. This includes Roose Bolton, the current warden of the North who betrayed the Starks and stole Winterfell. At first Jon refuses to send a letter to Roose, but is reminded the Night's Watch remains neutral. So he reluctantly asks. His next move is even bolder, he plans to allow the wild-lings to pass through the Wall and settle in the North as subjects of the Seven Kingdoms, or even let them join the Watch. Jon's idea is met with harsh criticism, but he points out that every single wildling left on the north side of the Wall will be killed, then resurrected, and then added to the White Walkers ever-growing army. Jon then leads a rescue mission to a place beyond-the-wall called Hardhome, in order to save wild-lings who were separated during Stannis' attack. The mission is a success, however; bringing even more wild-lings into Castle Black does not go over well with many of the Night's Watch.

\- As mentioned above, Dany marries a noblemen in order to better unite Meereen. And she also agrees to re-open the fighting pits to freedman only, something she has constantly been against. This move is a way of showing the masters she can respect their old traditions. And during her fist visit to a fighting pit practice exhibition, she is given a gift, Tyrion Lannister. All Dany knows of house Lannister is that they played a role in casting out her family, so naturally Tyrion is first seen as an enemy. But after some discussion, Dany agrees to allow Tyrion to counsel her. His knowledge of ruling and of Westeros are of great value.

* *Consequences of one's actions.*

\- The night Jon returns from Hardhome, his squire Olly comes and tells him one of the wild-lings knows of the whereabouts of his uncle Benjen Stark, who has been missing since Season 1. Jon goes down and follows Thorne to a gathering of his Watch brothers, only to find a sign marked ""Traitor"". Thorne, Olly, and other members of the Night's Watch begin to stab Jon, each saying ""For the Watch"". Jon siding with the wild-lings may have been the right decision, but men who have fought them all their lives did not seen it this way. Jon collapses and seemingly dies from his wounds, bleeding out onto the cold snow.

\- Dany is in attendance at the official opening of the fighting pits. Lately things in Meereen have cooled down, and everyone has relaxed their guard. Suddenly, Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering both masters and freedmen alike – Hizdahr included. The new found peace was simply a distraction for this main attack. Dany and her companions are pushed toward the center of the pit, and just when they look to be in trouble, Drogon swoops down, defends Dany, and then leaves with her to an unknown location. Her city is at war again, this time without its queen.

**Season 6:**

* *Both are reborn, new, and improved?*

\- Jon was last seen bleeding out from his wounds delivered by his fellow Night's Watch members. The worst happens, and Jon dies. But Ser Davos isn't giving up. He enlists the help of the Red Witch Melisandre, to see if she can resurrect him. She is reluctant, but tries anyways. She preforms her spell, and it looks like it failed. But as everyone is leaving, Jon Snow opens his eyes, alive once again. His death also allows him to leave the Night's Watch, as his vows end now that he has died.

\- After Drogon takes Dany away from Meereen, she is met by a massive Dothraki khalasar. She is taken prisoner, but once it's discovered she was married to a Khal, she is told she must join the Dosh Khalleen. A group of all the wives of fallen Khals. This doesn't sit well with Dany. All the Khals from across the land are gathered in their city Vaes Dothrak, and are deciding if Dany is allowed to join the Khalleen. Dany has another idea. She traps the Khals inside their meeting hut, sets the place on fire killing them all, and emerges reborn from fire once again as Daenerys Targaryen, the Unburnt.

* *Revenge.*

\- A newly resurrected Jon has to take care of some unfinished business. The Night's Watchmen who killed him had all been captured, and were to face justice. Jon offers Thorne, Olly, and two other men a chance for any last words, and then has all four publicly hung. Revenge is his, even if it isn't so sweet.

\- As mentioned above, Dany kills all the former Khals. They took her prisoner, insulted her, would have raped her, abused her, and would have made her remain a Dosh Khalleen. Her revenge was swift and powerful.

* *Form a new army.*

\- Now that Jon is no longer apart of the Night's Watch, he isn't sure what to do. That changes when his ""sister"", Sansa Stark, arrives at Castle Black. She informs him that she ran from Winterfell, where she was married to the abusive Ramsay Bolton, and that his forces are looking for her. They eventually devise a plan to take back Winterfell, and defeat the Boltons. To do so, Jon and his allies ask any northern lords who haven't joined the Boltons to fight with him, as well as the wild-lings. Some agree, and an army is formed, but one smaller than they need.

\- Once Dany burns all the Khals, she asks all the Dothraki to join her and her cause. They all agree, and suddenly Dany has a much larger force.

* *Fight for their future.*

\- Jon, and his out-numbered men, get ready to battle the Bolton's army for control of the North. They have a plan to make up for their lack of men, but that goes away once Ramsay releases Jon's youngest ""brother"" Rickon and has him run across the battlefield, while he shoots arrows at him. Jon makes it feet away from Rickon, right before an arrow hits and kills him. Enraged, Jon attacks the whole army, and his men follow. The battle is fierce, but it seems Ramsay has led Jon into a trap. Right when hope is lost, Sansa comes in with the Knights of the Vale and smash Ramsay's forces. Jon follows a fleeing Ramsay to Winterfell, and proceeds to beat the living crap out of Ramsay. The battle is won, and once again Starks rule Winterfell. 

\- While Dany has been gone, Tyrion has ruled Meereen in her place. He's a good ruler, but not as threatening as ""the mother of dragons"". So finally, all the slavers from Slaver's Bay begin an assault on Meereen. Just then, Dany and Drogon arrive and ready for battle. With a newly freed Rhaegal and Viserion, Dany and her three dragons begin burning the Slaver's fleet. They quickly begin retreating, but a message must be sent, so Dany has 2/3 of the former high-masters executed, and tells the third to spread the tale of what happened here. Of what happened when slavery tried to return to Meereen. 

* *Begin a new chapter, stronger than ever.*

\- With the battle won the North is safe, and a Stark once again holds the North and Winterfell. Now they must figure out what's next. A lot of powerful, northern houses have been hurt in the constant warfare, and someone needs to lead. Lyanna Mormont, the new leader of House Mormont, stands and makes a case for Jon Snow. Although he's a Snow, he's still a Stark, and for the most part a Stark has always ruled the North. This fact, and Jon's proven merit, sway the other lords in attendance, and soon chants of ""the White Wolf"" and ""King of the North"" are shouted by almost everyone. Jon hesitantly, accepts the honor, out of duty and not for personal glory. A new chapter begins, and from a bastard to King of the North! 

\- Now that the slavers have been put down, ships and soldiers are plentiful, and the dragons are battle-ready, Dany is ready to set sail for Westeros. She has three dragons, and Unsullied army, a Dothraki horde, and alliances with both House Tyrell and Martell, two old and respected houses in Westeros. A new chapter begins, one that finally has Dany in Westeros!

**Season 7:**

* *Plan for the future.*

\- Now as King of the North, Jon has more responsibility than ever. But the biggest threat is still that beyond the Wall, the WWs. Jon begins planning his tactics, one of which is convincing those in Westeros that the threat is even real.

\- Now in Westeros, Dany plans to fight for the Iron Throne, and the Lannisters are her target. With all her strength at the ready, she and her advisers plan for war. 

* *End of similarities (mostly), because the meeting is here!*

\- Dany is advised to invite Jon to Dragonstone, as he is gaining quite a reputation. 

\- Jon agrees and he and Davos make the journey. 

\- Jon arrives, and Ice and Fire are officially united!!!!!!!!!! 

\- Instantly the contrasts in styles are on full display. Jon is relaxed and focused on the bigger threat (Ice), while 

Dany is aggressive and more power-hungry (Fire).

\- Both at some point in the season go into battle, and each put themselves on the front-line. 

Over the course of the rest of the season, their bond grows stronger. And finally, in the season finale, they hook up for the first time. This sets the stage for a wedding, and maybe even a child in Season 8?

That's all! A lot of info, but after seeing all their similarities it seems very much like Jon and Dany are the embodiment of Ice and Fire. I'm not sure how the book will deal with the Azor Ahai prophecy, but it seems like the show is simplifying it, and making Jon and Dany each a half of the prophecy. It works! And who knows, this could all be right. Or completely wrong. Just my interpretation of the material. Thanks for the read! ",gameofthrones,True,1533189390,2018-08-02

[SPOILERS] for season 7. Finale theory: Daenerys will become Azor Ahai but also the Mad Queen,"
Okay so here’s my theory for the finale or at least what I think would be a great ending. 
1. Jon is somehow not totally dead. So he and Danny are going to team up and fight the white walkers. Danny kills most of them with her dragons (epic fight between the ice dragons leaves only Drogon alive) Jon goes to fight the night king. The night king stabs him in the heart, but somehow Jon stays alive. But how? Because he’s already dead. He then proceeds to kill the Night King. 
Danny kills Cersei. 
2. Danny let’s Jon know she is pregnant with his baby. 
3. Danny is all set to take the thrown bc in the battle the Lannisters we destroyed except for Tyrion. 
4. Sam jumps in and claims that Jon is the rightful king and the people agree. 
5. Jon (as always) begrudgingly accepts. 
6. Danny mad with rage and power-hungry decides to kill Jon. 
7. She publicly attacks John with Drogon. 
8. John fights back but just as he is about to kill her, he remembers that she is pregnant and can’t do it 
9. She stabs him in the heart with little finger’s knife which is given to her as a baby gift. 
10. This does kill John. And she orders Drogon to burn is body. 
11. After the flames die down a sword is found to have replaced the knife. 
12. The sword is Lightbringer
13. Then the narrator tell us that everyone had the Azor Ahai prophecy wrong. They thought the it meant that a great warrior be a hero for men but it actually foretold the warrior that would end Westeros. The light brought was the fire of dragons. 
14. Danny goes onto to become a mad queen who destroys Westeros and all the characters we know and love in her quest for power and her version of justice. She became know as the worst ruler ever. 
15. After the tragic tale ends, a very old Tyrion Lannister is seen dictating this story to a young scribe. He lives across the narrow sea now. He briefly describes to the scribe how he escaped  one night from King’s Landing and from Danny’s reign. 
16. And some way, either a young man comes to Tyrion’s home or he goes in another room where this man is...in some way we (the audience) find out that not only did he escape but he also took something with him . . . Jon and Danny’s son. His name is Aegon or Eddard or something significant and heartbreaking for the audience. 

As a side note: I think it would be interesting for Cersei to find out Danny is pregnant and give her some ominous warning about what mothers will do to protect their children and make a better world for them. She would then be killed. But this warning settles into Danny’s mind and becomes part of her logic when she takes action against Jon and Westeros.

[Spoilers] Wait so Prince Doran...,"Has gout?!?!

I apologize if I’m ignorant and this is something people with gout suffer from but...

If he’s in a special chair, is skipping events, and generally doesn’t leave his palace because his spoiled ass is sitting around stuffing his face with liver, that TOTALLY changes my view of him and his death.

I had always assumed it was an injury or disability.

Do they say this in the show and I missed it?  I’m confused because usually this show would make it a point to highlight this.  Like a scene with him grossly tearing into a big juicy steak while telling others to exercise more control.

I’m only about half way through ASOS so I may be jumping the gun but I’ve seen the show twice so no worries about spoiling it for me.

Him being more of a glutton rather than an unlucky soul like Tyrian totally changes the plot around him for me.

Because all undead are killed in one hit by dragonglass and it doesn't matter where they are hit. Danearys apparantly has a mountain of it under her castle. So they could just build a thousand big dragonglass arrows for those ballistas or just give them to archers and crossbowmen and then shoot that thing down in an instant. (as far as i know a scratch is enough?) They are also good vs the common undead and you can make veeery many arrows out of a mountain of that stuff. I wonder how they adress this or if at all.

[SPOILERS] Arthurian legend and the crypts of Winterfell,"First time poster so be kind! Had the tv on idly while doing chores and it spoke about Alderley Edge. Supposedly this is important in folklore as the resting place of King Arthur and the knights of the round table... the story went that their burial place would be opened by a wizard (maybe ascendant of / reincarnated / immortal Merlin) when England was facing its darkest threat, and the knights would rise to fight and vanquish its foes on the plains below. Given Jon’s dreams of the Winterfell crypts and the return of magic, could this be grrm’s inspiration for the collapsed crypts at Winterfell? And does this mean an ancient wizard needs to open them? Thinking bran if he is truly immortal now he’s the 3 eyed crow. Could mean the turn of the tide in the (almost) inevitable battle for Winterfell (at least in the series rather than the books).

"[SPOILERS] Rewatching the series, this scene early in Season 1 makes a lot more sense when you think about it.","In Season 1 episode 2, Robert is joking around with Ned remembering the prostitutes he kept around during the war. Things go sour when Robert starts inquiring about Jon Snow's mother, saying Ned never told him what she looked like. Ned says he never will, Robert misinterprets this as Ned being angry at himself, but of course we know it's because Lyanna was Jon's mother. It didn't help that Robert starts joking about what it took to make Ned break his honour. It was of course Robert who made Ned sully his name due to his murderous desire for revenge against all Targaryens. I think Ned looks angry by this point.

Then things get worse because Robert brings out the message he got about Daenerys' wedding. Now it makes total sense why Ned is so frustrated at Robert right off the bat when he reads it. Robert had already rubbed Ned wrong by making him remember what he was forced to do to protect Jon, and now the conversation is going right back to the Targaryens and some plot to murder yet another innocent kid.

[SPOILERS] A humble endgame theory about life &amp; death,"TL;DR It’s all about the imminent baby, isn’t it?

The series has always been about one simple premise: the parallels of life (what must exist) and death (what threatens the balance, magic), each one represented by a character. Each one a parallel of the other.

Let’s start with Daenerys.
Life: fire.
The core of her story and character has always resolved around her as a mother, a life giver. The matriarch. The one to kill death with dragons.
Her obstacle: She faced death (magic) and lose her purpose as the “life character” (birth).

Then there’s Jon.
Death: ice.
The core of his character resolves around the white walkers’ threat. He becomes the leader to fight the coming of death.
His obstacle: He died, then came back to life using the same magic he’s trying to defeat.

- She’s the representation of the hope of life.
- He’s the good-guys representation of death.

So, Life and Death’s destinies meet and we have a child: the union between life and death, ice and fire, into a new being. The key to everything.

The last time the representations of life (Azor Ahai) and death (Nissa) “created” something, was a “power” (Lightbringer) able to defeat the while walkers.

The twist: the white walkers ultimate goal has always been to stop/kill D&amp;J’s baby. They knew from the start this being would exist in the future, and that it represents the power to defeat them all, somehow.

The series has had these 3 stories (Jon’s, Dany’s and the WW/NK’s) advancing since the beginning to meet at this point.

So... the infamous bittersweet ending may have 2 scenarios:
- The baby is sacrificed to end it all (unlikely).
- Jon must take death’s side and they won’t ever be together (because there’s only “what must exist” and death must cease to exist in this world) and Dany and the baby are safe. (Likely).


PD: I’m not a native english-speaker, nor have I read the books (just theories) and it’s also my first time posting here, so gods please have mercy!

[SPOILERS] White walkers as opposed to Wights,"First of all this post is regarding the show (haven't read the books yet):

As I'm thinking of it and watching White Walker scenes, most people think the White Walkers and the Wights (the people that the WW's raise from the death) often have the same objective. But I find it very interesting that the primary instinct of the wights are to kill the first living thing they see ahead of them, no matter where they are or who is with them. While I can't recall the White Walkers ever solely going for a kill, if they do it's because there's an agressor (or threat). Otherwise they aren't actually as aggressive themselves as I and probably most people assume on first sight. It's like were getting lead on the wrong foot by thinking the White Walkers have this killer instinct while actually if you watch the scenes objectively they really don't (in the scenes that we see in the show).

Could there be a deeper meaning to this behavior and maybe including a major plot twist as to why the White Walkers are heading south? PS: I could be completely wrong based on the books, idk.",gameofthrones,True,1533310757,2018-08-03

[SPOILERS] Theory: What did Tyrion promise Cersi to change her mind?,"In the opening of the season finale, they all meet in the Dragon. Jon Snow fucks it up, and Tyrion goes to speak with Cersi alone.

After discovering she's pregnant, the cut to her returning and declaring an alliance. 

So what did Tyrion promise her?

Well, if you go back a few episodes, Tyrion and Dany have a heated conversation about concession, since the witch prophesied that she could not bare children.

My theory is that he promised that if Dany won, they would take her child and raise it to be the heir to the throne. It makes sense that Cersi would agree to this, as she knows her army (as it stands) can't defeat Dany's, as well as gives her a chance to both look like the hero while also planning what she imagines is the perfect betrayal; Euron returns with the Gold Company and together, she believes they would have the strength to defeat either what remains of Jon and Dany's forces, or to battle the Night King and  defend Kings Landing.

Which is also why Tyrion has such a look of dread when Dany and Jon hook-up. While he was sure he could talk Dany into raising a Lannister as her own and leaving the kingdom to that child, he's less sure he could convince Jon if a bond between the two was formed. Furthermore, on the off chance Dany could get preggers, a child born of the two of them would have a significantly greater claim to the thrown than a bastard Lannister.

[NO SPOILERS] Lord Rickard Stark possible involvement with Rhaegar and Lyanna,"The argument of R+L and whether they ran away in secret or were blessed by Lord Stark. 

My stance: Lord Rickard Stark knew and allowed the marriage between Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. 

My Reason: Why wouldn't he? 

The whole idea that Lyanna defied her father and ran away with Rhaegar, or allowed herself to be kidnapped, thus inciting a war and getting her and Rhaegar's family killed, just doesn’t seem right to me. 

The North is all about Honor and respect and the value of family, everything Lyanna did (at face value) speaks the opposite of that. Why would a true born, northern woman, daughter of the Warden of the North, defy the very foundations of the Northern beliefs and morales? For a man she didn’t know ?? (Because if she was the KOTLT -Knight of the Laughing Tree \*see Tourney of Harrenhall for further details- she would have only come face to face with Rhaegar for an extremely short period of time ONCE and then left the tourney and didn’t see him again until the night she vanished.)

Let’s review the events that led to the night of her departure with Rhaegar.

Whatever happens at the Tourney, Happens. Strangely enough, Ashara Dayne -best friend to Elia Martell/Targaryen- danced with men who were either directly involved in the Rebellion or related to someone who was. She danced with Oberyn-Brother to Elia. With her own Brother, Arthur Dayne- siblings that had connections to the Tower of Joy (TOJ) as it was near THEIR home. She also danced with the boy who loved her, Ned Stark- brother to Lyanna. Jon Connington- man involved with King Aerys directly. And Berristan Selmy- another man in direct service to the King. 

I believe that she was indeed the KOTLT as the events surrounding THAT point at Lyanna being a knight in disguise for Honor’s sake! (let me just stop right there and point out how HONORABLE Lyanna was. She went to fight against men far more experienced and stronger than her and WINS to teach a lesson of honor. Now this is either tragically ironic, or has a meaning behind her actions. She went through all of that to teach them honor and then turns her back on her own beliefs just a year later for a guy she doesn’t know?) 

Rhaegar, attending with his wife (Who may have just gotten pregnant with Aegon, see my birth timeline for details) is sent out to find this mystery knight and bring them back so that Aerys can execute the apparent Him. But Rhaegar does not find a man, he finds a young woman. Not just ANY woman, but Lyanna Stark -whether she said her name or Rhaegar knew this, or didn't know it at the time is yet to be determined. Rhaegar cannot allow her to be killed for MANY reasons, the foremost being that she’s a Woman who was simply teaching a lesson to some knights. Impressed with her power, skills and sense of honor he of course lets her go.

Now it is said that Elia and Rhaegar WERE NOT IN LOVE and I cannot stress this point enough when talking about E+R. Plutonic love and caring for each other yes, but passionately in love, no. They were FORCED into marriage and had to deal with it the best way possible. (Thus the possibility that ending their union was mutual.)

It is Also rumored that this tourney was cover for a secret meeting between Rhaegar and some Lords and with that blown by the presence of King Aerys, Rhaegar is not sure who he can trust and what he can say. But in the privacy of their tent, Rhaegar tells his wife who the KOTLT really was; a young northern woman.  

Imagine them having a conversation along these lines…….

After Rhaegar tells Elia what he found in the forest…..

E: “Who was she?”

R: “I don’t know her name.”

E: “Then if you see her if you win the tourney, place the crown on her head.”

R: “Are you sure? As my wife I should crown You.”

E: “What use have I for a crown of roses when I was born with a Real crown?”

I believe Elia was not petty enough to be upset if she was not given the crown of roses should Rhaegar win the tourney. She was born a REAL princess, to be a REAL queen. Why would a real princess worry about a fake crown at some tourney? She wouldn’t, instead she allows Rhaegar to crown the mystery woman should he win to recognize this Lady Knight for her honor and strength. 

Rhaegar wins the Turney. When the moment comes to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, Rhaegar sees the girl as Lyanna and places it on her head. Elia realizes what she allowed him to do, so does Rhaegar, but they both agreed and stay true to their word and crown the woman who was the KOTLT. After that everyone leaves with a bit of tension on the matter.

Fast forward nine months to the birth of Aegon. Rhaegar, having not been able to bring all the lords together at Harrenhall, has done what other Princes failed to do by bringing Dorne into the royal family and having a son by their Princess Elia.

 Rhaegar was a BOOKWORM before he took up the sword and I believe his whole reason for doing everything he did was due to something HE READ. He also lived on Dragonstone so I wouldn’t doubt that he possibly saw the same things Jon discovered in THAT CAVE and possibly even showed/told Elia (she was after all on his “side” and was smart and his wife). Rhaegar might have known all along that the Night King was coming but who the HECK WOULD BELIEVE HIM?! No one in power.....except maybe some Northerns who lived where the Night King would come from… So Rhaegar has to do all of this without anyone’s knowledge except those he knew he could trust to be involved. 

But who could he trust? His wife and Ashara Dayne, his best friend Arthur Dayne and very few others.  

After Aegon is born Rhaegar KNOWS Elia will die if she has ONE MORE CHILD. Not wanting to leave his children motherless and force Elia to have another, they agree that he must seek a wife and third child else where. He really wants to bring his sigil to life and reincarnate Aegon/Rhaenys/Visenya, his two children where named Aegon and Rhaenys after all. This he believed would unite the kingdom behind him and break them away from Aerys so that Rhaegar could dispose of his insane father with the least amount of friction possible and then implant himself as king and prepare the lands for the Long Night. So he MUST have a third child……perhaps some vision was sent to him through a certain red lady...

Somehow, Lyanna is brought up. Though Rhaegar will have to convince Lord Stark of breaking the engagement between Lyanna/Robert… Ashara -involved with their plan- goes back to Dorne under the rumor that SHE is with child. No one objects to her returning home……where she will then prepare the Tower of Joy for Rhaegar’s new wife and possibly Elia when she is well enough to travel.

I think she danced with the men at Harrenhall for information. Somehow her dance partners are involved with the choices Elia/Rhaegar and Ashara make at this point. 

Rhaegar leaves Dragonstone -where he was with his family. When Aerys imprisoned Elia in KL he had her brought there from DS- and goes across Westeros to find Lord Stark. Lyanna is not yet wed to Robert Baratheon (Side note, LYANNA HATED ROBERT. He was a father to a bastard ALREADY before they even wed and she looked down upon him. Of course she would take any chance to get out of her betrothal to him. Robert’s father was her father’s friend and was long since dead.) While they were coming down from the north on the way to Riverrun for the wedding, they would have been traveling around Harrenhall. Camping out along the way and Brandon was someways ahead.

(Hold onto your tinfoil hats out there)

Rhaegar rode around with a handful of guards and finally found the Starks. I am convinced he spoke to Rickard Stark about the Long Night, something Rickard is extremely surprised about seeing that its mostly a Northern story and a southern Prince seems to know all about it and actually believes in it. Rhaegar somehow convinces Rickard to end the engagement with Robert Baratheon and wed Lyanna to him. But he is married? His wife is annulling the marriage as they speak so that she may return to Dorne and live a full life. She has done her duty as a royal wife and given him a son. Not to mention that Rhaegar knows Lyanna was the KOTLT at the Tourney of Harrenhall, (blackmail?). It was Rickard who arranged for Lyanna to marry Robert as Robert’s father was dead by that time and Robert was still being fostered in the Eryie so Rickard has the power to end that engagement and make a new one.

Given Lyanna’s contempt of Robert and her emotional response towards Rhaegar, she makes him consider the marriage. After all, Rickard had “southern ambitions”. What better arrangement than for the first Stark to become Queen of Westeros? But that probably wasn’t enough to make Rickard break the vow at first…so Rhaegar has one last moment to convince him and does so by telling him SOMETHING, maybe showing him something in flames? He says that he wishes to dethrone Aerys and team with the North?

Rhaegar convinces Rickard to let Lyanna go with him to Dorne and wed him and have his child there. Somehow, Lord Stark agrees. But this is not something that can be simply sent by raven to tell Robert about, its way too involved, elaborate and sensitive, so Stark allows Lyanna to go to Dorne with Rhaegar and commence with the plans all in secret. Robert wouldn’t be able to retaliate because they would have already been wed by the time he found out and it couldn’t be undone, all at the behest of the one who arranged it in the first place. Rickard would wait until After Brandon married Cat and he could personally tell Robert what happened and why.

There are those who think Lord Rickard did not agree, but Rhaegar would not kidnap Lyanna, that doesn’t make sense. He was not his father. Lyanna could have run away, but both of them were too smart to ignore the repercussions of her simply abandoning her father’s arrangement to Robert and putting everyone in jeopardy by running away with the Prince. I doubt Rhaegar would have been ok with her turning her back on everyone and everything so the only logical explanation has to be that Lord Rickard Stark knew everything all along. Neither R nor L would have been dumb enough to not expect fall out after running away for no other reason than a summer fling. (Even if both were married, there are easier ways of sneaking around to see each other than running away.)

Why Lyanna at all? To secure the North. He had the South, Dorne, and was secure with a son. As I read somewhere, about some Targaryen, he married once for duty and once for love. Not only love but the North is what Rhaegar was after. In the event of dethroning Aerys he would have the ENTIRE support of the North AND the South! Through wives and children. To crush everything and everyone in-between who would have sided with Aerys. Rhaegar was covering all his bases so to speak, the North from where the Night King would come, and the south were he would eventually hide his family in the event of the Long Night.

But SOMEONE (through all of GRRM's details this one seems to be missing, who told Brandon? It may have relevance, it may not. But I want to know.) told Brandon THE LIE that Lyanna had been forcibly kidnapped by Rhaegar. He abandoned his wedding, which was stupid because he could have gone to KL with an ARMY behind him but no! He ran off with a handful of buddies to KL (King's Landing) and his noble and honorable ways got himself locked up due to his brash behavior. King Aerys was in KL, Rhaegar and his family would have been on Dragonstone. Aerys had no idea what Rhaegar had/has been up to and when Brandon comes in saying everything he does Aerys takes it as a threat. Since he’s insane of course he doesn’t believe anything anyone says……we know what happened afterwards.

So why do I believe Rickard Stark agreed? Because GRRM, a stickler for the finest, smallest of details, didn’t seem to mention Rickard’s actions and stance on the matter of his only betrothed daughter being allegedly Kidnapped by the very noticeable Prince who was- at face value- already married. Logically, Lord Stark should have been the one to inform his son that Lyanna was taken right out from under him. Lyanna would have been traveling with her father because no engaged noble Lady traveled without a guardian, father, brother or husband present. As far as we know, Lord Stark DID NOT tell Brandon what happened and DID NOT react to the ""abduction"" of Lyanna in any mentionable way. (Which is unusual for GRRM to neglect details as important as that as he does not neglect details by accident or laziness. I believe the lack of action on Lord Stark's part might mean something after all.)

Rickard apparently didn’t do ANYTHING until Aerys told him to come to KL. Now lets take into account how long it took Brandon to actually get to KL, roughly a short week riding alone as it was mentioned later that it took Tywin two weeks (a fortnight) to get to KL from Casterly Rock -which is at the other side of the continent- with an entire provisioned army in tow. In the span of the time it took Brandon to get there, no one mentions how angry Lord Stark was at Rhaegar for running off with Lyanna. If we go by what is told, it appears Lord Stark didn’t even know his son had ridden to KL or that his daughter -who was traveling with him- had been kidnapped at all. 

If Lyanna had truly been taken without Rickard’s consent, it seems that it would make sense if he expressed anger and did something about it. But why isn't Rickard's reaction or feelings about it mentioned? He would have been with her at the time, yet the lack of his reaction, and the focus on only Brandon's, seems strange. It's like they heard two versions of same event. Why doesn't Rickard gather his sons and go to war? Or they might have even ridden after the Prince himself, he was hard to miss. Lyanna was good at disguise?  (GRRM could have done a lot with those events, he could have elaborated but he is telling us details without telling us anything at all. )

The very lack of mentioning of Lord Stark doing anything in Lyanna’s defense speaks volumes to me -Very clearly- that Lord Stark was somehow involved with R+L running off. Had Brandon NOT been misinformed of her disappearance, R+L could have married/procreated in the TOJ (Tower of Joy) in Dorne, Brandon/Cat could have married, Robert would have been out of luck. A war would have come, but if Rhaegar had his way not until Elia was well enough to travel  home without suspicion. (In other words, it would be a totally different story but what shaped the line of events is missing pieces)

But someone lies to Brandon and in the span of nearly two weeks since then, he gets himself and his father killed. Rickard cannot tell Aerys the truth as the truth is extremely dangerous. Either Rickard was an idiot or he was involved, his actions speak that. He knows the truth of R+L but can’t say it because Aerys wouldn’t believe it anyways. In the accounts of what happened in King's Landing that day, Rickard doesn’t even bring up the subject of Lyanna, he only speaks in Brandon’s defense. Why?? Because he knew where and why R+L ran off to and under what circumstances they did. 

The Starks are killed and it would have been another few days for Ned/Robert/Jon Arryn to receive word about it all. Nearly two to three weeks after Lyanna’s “disappearance” is when Robert finally hears about anything! AND it was Jon Arryn who started the fighting by attacking Gull Town and refusing to give up Robert/Ned.  

Now there is Always the possibility that R+L truly did run away, that Rickard sent the message to Brandon about it. But that does not explain why Rickard -according to the books or even anywhere in the show as far as I know and could find- did not go with Brandon to KL for Lyanna, he did not inform Winterfell or Ned/Robert of the events happening, he did not raise alarm the very moment he would have known she was gone against his wishes. He did seemingly nothing at all about anything except Brandon in KL. Again, either GRRM made Rickard a completely idiot or he knew something. knowledge of R+L. Knowing GRRM like we do its most likely he had Rickard in on the entire arrangement the whole time. But the twist came in Brandon’s brash reaction and the lie someone told him about R+L.

Now there is Always the possibility that R+L truly did run away, that Rickard sent the message to Brandon about it. But that does not explain why Rickard -according to the books or even anywhere in the show as far as I know and could find- did not go with Brandon to KL for Lyanna, he did not inform Winterfell or Ned/Robert of the events happening, he did not raise alarm the very moment he would have known she was gone against his wishes. He did seemingly nothing at all about anything except Brandon in KL. Again, either GRRM made Rickard a completely idiot or he knew something. knowledge of R+L.

[SOILERS] [EVERYTHING] Lord Rickard Stark Theory,"The argument of R+L and whether they ran away in secret or were blessed by Lord Stark.

My stance: Lord Rickard Stark knew and allowed the marriage between Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen.

My Reason: Why wouldn't he?

The whole idea that Lyanna defied her father and ran away with Rhaegar, or allowed herself to be kidnapped, thus inciting a war and getting her and Rhaegar's family killed, just doesn’t seem right to me.

The North is all about Honor and respect and the value of family, everything Lyanna did (at face value) speaks the opposite of that. Why would a true born, northern woman, daughter of the Warden of the North, defy the very foundations of the Northern beliefs and morales? For a man she didn’t know ?? (Because if she was the KOTLT -Knight of the Laughing Tree \*see Tourney of Harrenhall for further details- she would have only come face to face with Rhaegar for an extremely short period of time ONCE and then left the tourney and didn’t see him again until the night she vanished.)

Let’s review the events that led to the night of her departure with Rhaegar.

Whatever happens at the Tourney, Happens. Strangely enough, Ashara Dayne -best friend to Elia Martell/Targaryen- danced with men who were either directly involved in the Rebellion or related to someone who was. She danced with Oberyn-Brother to Elia. With her own Brother, Arthur Dayne- siblings that had connections to the Tower of Joy (TOJ) as it was near THEIR home. She also danced with the boy who loved her, Ned Stark- brother to Lyanna. Jon Connington- man involved with King Aerys directly. And Berristan Selmy- another man in direct service to the King.

I believe that she was indeed the KOTLT as the events surrounding THAT point at Lyanna being a knight in disguise for Honor’s sake! (let me just stop right there and point out how HONORABLE Lyanna was. She went to fight against men far more experienced and stronger than her and WINS to teach a lesson of honor. Now this is either tragically ironic, or has a meaning behind her actions. She went through all of that to teach them honor and then turns her back on her own beliefs just a year later for a guy she doesn’t know?)

Rhaegar, attending with his wife (Who may have just gotten pregnant with Aegon, see my birth timeline for details) is sent out to find this mystery knight and bring them back so that Aerys can execute the apparent Him. But Rhaegar does not find a man, he finds a young woman. Not just ANY woman, but Lyanna Stark -whether she said her name or Rhaegar knew this, or didn't know it at the time is yet to be determined. Rhaegar cannot allow her to be killed for MANY reasons, the foremost being that she’s a Woman who was simply teaching a lesson to some knights. Impressed with her power, skills and sense of honor he of course lets her go.

Now it is said that Elia and Rhaegar WERE NOT IN LOVE and I cannot stress this point enough when talking about E+R. Plutonic love and caring for each other yes, but passionately in love, no. They were FORCED into marriage and had to deal with it the best way possible. (Thus the possibility that ending their union was mutual.)

It is Also rumored that this tourney was cover for a secret meeting between Rhaegar and some Lords and with that blown by the presence of King Aerys, Rhaegar is not sure who he can trust and what he can say. But in the privacy of their tent, Rhaegar tells his wife who the KOTLT really was; a young northern woman.

Imagine them having a conversation along these lines…….

After Rhaegar tells Elia what he found in the forest…..

E: “Who was she?”

R: “I don’t know her name.”

E: “Then if you see her if you win the tourney, place the crown on her head.”

R: “Are you sure? As my wife I should crown You.”

E: “What use have I for a crown of roses when I was born with a Real crown?”

I believe Elia was not petty enough to be upset if she was not given the crown of roses should Rhaegar win the tourney. She was born a REAL princess, to be a REAL queen. Why would a real princess worry about a fake crown at some tourney? She wouldn’t, instead she allows Rhaegar to crown the mystery woman should he win to recognize this Lady Knight for her honor and strength.

Rhaegar wins the Turney. When the moment comes to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, Rhaegar sees the girl as Lyanna and places it on her head. Elia realizes what she allowed him to do, so does Rhaegar, but they both agreed and stay true to their word and crown the woman who was the KOTLT. After that everyone leaves with a bit of tension on the matter.

Fast forward nine months to the birth of Aegon. Rhaegar, having not been able to bring all the lords together at Harrenhall, has done what other Princes failed to do by bringing Dorne into the royal family and having a son by their Princess Elia.

Rhaegar was a BOOKWORM before he took up the sword and I believe his whole reason for doing everything he did was due to something HE READ. He also lived on Dragonstone so I wouldn’t doubt that he possibly saw the same things Jon discovered in THAT CAVE and possibly even showed/told Elia (she was after all on his “side” and was smart and his wife). Rhaegar might have known all along that the Night King was coming but who the HECK WOULD BELIEVE HIM?! No one in power.....except maybe some Northerns who lived where the Night King would come from… So Rhaegar has to do all of this without anyone’s knowledge except those he knew he could trust to be involved.

But who could he trust? His wife and Ashara Dayne, his best friend Arthur Dayne and very few others.

After Aegon is born Rhaegar KNOWS Elia will die if she has ONE MORE CHILD. Not wanting to leave his children motherless and force Elia to have another, they agree that he must seek a wife and third child else where. He really wants to bring his sigil to life and reincarnate Aegon/Rhaenys/Visenya, his two children where named Aegon and Rhaenys after all. This he believed would unite the kingdom behind him and break them away from Aerys so that Rhaegar could dispose of his insane father with the least amount of friction possible and then implant himself as king and prepare the lands for the Long Night. So he MUST have a third child……perhaps some vision was sent to him through a certain red lady...

Somehow, Lyanna is brought up. Though Rhaegar will have to convince Lord Stark of breaking the engagement between Lyanna/Robert… Ashara -involved with their plan- goes back to Dorne under the rumor that SHE is with child. No one objects to her returning home……where she will then prepare the Tower of Joy for Rhaegar’s new wife and possibly Elia when she is well enough to travel.

I think she danced with the men at Harrenhall for information. Somehow her dance partners are involved with the choices Elia/Rhaegar and Ashara make at this point.

Rhaegar leaves Dragonstone -where he was with his family. When Aerys imprisoned Elia in KL he had her brought there from DS- and goes across Westeros to find Lord Stark. Lyanna is not yet wed to Robert Baratheon (Side note, LYANNA HATED ROBERT. He was a father to a bastard ALREADY before they even wed and she looked down upon him. Of course she would take any chance to get out of her betrothal to him. Robert’s father was her father’s friend and was long since dead.) While they were coming down from the north on the way to Riverrun for the wedding, they would have been traveling around Harrenhall. Camping out along the way and Brandon was someways ahead.

(Hold onto your tinfoil hats out there)

Rhaegar rode around with a handful of guards and finally found the Starks. I am convinced he spoke to Rickard Stark about the Long Night, something Rickard is extremely surprised about seeing that its mostly a Northern story and a southern Prince seems to know all about it and actually believes in it. Rhaegar somehow convinces Rickard to end the engagement with Robert Baratheon and wed Lyanna to him. But he is married? His wife is annulling the marriage as they speak so that she may return to Dorne and live a full life. She has done her duty as a royal wife and given him a son. Not to mention that Rhaegar knows Lyanna was the KOTLT at the Tourney of Harrenhall, (blackmail?). It was Rickard who arranged for Lyanna to marry Robert as Robert’s father was dead by that time and Robert was still being fostered in the Eryie so Rickard has the power to end that engagement and make a new one.

Given Lyanna’s contempt of Robert and her emotional response towards Rhaegar, she makes him consider the marriage. After all, Rickard had “southern ambitions”. What better arrangement than for the first Stark to become Queen of Westeros? But that probably wasn’t enough to make Rickard break the vow at first…so Rhaegar has one last moment to convince him and does so by telling him SOMETHING, maybe showing him something in flames? He says that he wishes to dethrone Aerys and team with the North?

Rhaegar convinces Rickard to let Lyanna go with him to Dorne and wed him and have his child there. Somehow, Lord Stark agrees. But this is not something that can be simply sent by raven to tell Robert about, its way too involved, elaborate and sensitive, so Stark allows Lyanna to go to Dorne with Rhaegar and commence with the plans all in secret. Robert wouldn’t be able to retaliate because they would have already been wed by the time he found out and it couldn’t be undone, all at the behest of the one who arranged it in the first place. Rickard would wait until After Brandon married Cat and he could personally tell Robert what happened and why.

There are those who think Lord Rickard did not agree, but Rhaegar would not kidnap Lyanna, that doesn’t make sense. He was not his father. Lyanna could have run away, but both of them were too smart to ignore the repercussions of her simply abandoning her father’s arrangement to Robert and putting everyone in jeopardy by running away with the Prince. I doubt Rhaegar would have been ok with her turning her back on everyone and everything so the only logical explanation has to be that Lord Rickard Stark knew everything all along. Neither R nor L would have been dumb enough to not expect fall out after running away for no other reason than a summer fling. (Even if both were married, there are easier ways of sneaking around to see each other than running away.)

Why Lyanna at all? To secure the North. He had the South, Dorne, and was secure with a son. As I read somewhere, about some Targaryen, he married once for duty and once for love. Not only love but the North is what Rhaegar was after. In the event of dethroning Aerys he would have the ENTIRE support of the North AND the South! Through wives and children. To crush everything and everyone in-between who would have sided with Aerys. Rhaegar was covering all his bases so to speak, the North from where the Night King would come, and the south were he would eventually hide his family in the event of the Long Night.

But SOMEONE (through all of GRRM's details this one seems to be missing, who told Brandon? It may have relevance, it may not. But I want to know.) told Brandon THE LIE that Lyanna had been forcibly kidnapped by Rhaegar. He abandoned his wedding, which was stupid because he could have gone to KL with an ARMY behind him but no! He ran off with a handful of buddies to KL (King's Landing) and his noble and honorable ways got himself locked up due to his brash behavior. King Aerys was in KL, Rhaegar and his family would have been on Dragonstone. Aerys had no idea what Rhaegar had/has been up to and when Brandon comes in saying everything he does Aerys takes it as a threat. Since he’s insane of course he doesn’t believe anything anyone says……we know what happened afterwards.

So why do I believe Rickard Stark agreed? Because GRRM, a stickler for the finest, smallest of details, didn’t seem to mention Rickard’s actions and stance on the matter of his only betrothed daughter being allegedly Kidnapped by the very noticeable Prince who was- at face value- already married. Logically, Lord Stark should have been the one to inform his son that Lyanna was taken right out from under him. Lyanna would have been traveling with her father because no engaged noble Lady traveled without a guardian, father, brother or husband present. As far as we know, Lord Stark DID NOT tell Brandon what happened and DID NOT react to the ""abduction"" of Lyanna in any mentionable way. (Which is unusual for GRRM to neglect details as important as that as he does not neglect details by accident or laziness. I believe the lack of action on Lord Stark's part might mean something after all.)

Rickard apparently didn’t do ANYTHING until Aerys told him to come to KL. Now lets take into account how long it took Brandon to actually get to KL, roughly a short week riding alone as it was mentioned later that it took Tywin two weeks (a fortnight) to get to KL from Casterly Rock -which is at the other side of the continent- with an entire provisioned army in tow. In the span of the time it took Brandon to get there, no one mentions how angry Lord Stark was at Rhaegar for running off with Lyanna. If we go by what is told, it appears Lord Stark didn’t even know his son had ridden to KL or that his daughter -who was traveling with him- had been kidnapped at all.

If Lyanna had truly been taken without Rickard’s consent, it seems that it would make sense if he expressed anger and did something about it. But why isn't Rickard's reaction or feelings about it mentioned? He would have been with her at the time, yet the lack of his reaction, and the focus on only Brandon's, seems strange. It's like they heard two versions of same event. Why doesn't Rickard gather his sons and go to war? Or they might have even ridden after the Prince himself, he was hard to miss. Lyanna was good at disguise?  (GRRM could have done a lot with those events, he could have elaborated but he is telling us details without telling us anything at all. )

The very lack of mentioning of Lord Stark doing anything in Lyanna’s defense speaks volumes to me -Very clearly- that Lord Stark was somehow involved with R+L running off. Had Brandon NOT been misinformed of her disappearance, R+L could have married/procreated in the TOJ (Tower of Joy) in Dorne, Brandon/Cat could have married, Robert would have been out of luck. A war would have come, but if Rhaegar had his way not until Elia was well enough to travel  home without suspicion. (In other words, it would be a totally different story but what shaped the line of events is missing pieces)

But someone lies to Brandon and in the span of nearly two weeks since then, he gets himself and his father killed. Rickard cannot tell Aerys the truth as the truth is extremely dangerous. Either Rickard was an idiot or he was involved, his actions speak that. He knows the truth of R+L but can’t say it because Aerys wouldn’t believe it anyways. In the accounts of what happened in King's Landing that day, Rickard doesn’t even bring up the subject of Lyanna, he only speaks in Brandon’s defense. Why?? Because he knew where and why R+L ran off to and under what circumstances they did.

The Starks are killed and it would have been another few days for Ned/Robert/Jon Arryn to receive word about it all. Nearly two to three weeks after Lyanna’s “disappearance” is when Robert finally hears about anything! AND it was Jon Arryn who started the fighting by attacking Gull Town and refusing to give up Robert/Ned.

But that does not explain why Rickard -according to the books or even anywhere in the show as far as I know and could find- did not go with Brandon to KL for Lyanna, he did not inform Winterfell or Ned/Robert of the events happening, he did not raise alarm the very moment he would have known she was gone against his wishes. He did seemingly nothing at all about anything except Brandon in KL. Again, either GRRM made Rickard a completely idiot or he knew something. knowledge of R+L. Knowing GRRM like we do its most likely he had Rickard in on the entire arrangement the whole time. But the twist came in Brandon’s brash reaction and the lie someone told him about R+L.",gameofthrones,True,1533341392,2018-08-03

[Spoilers] He chose his dragon,"Every discussion I've found online has a large percentage of doubters who say the NK choosing the dragon farthest away instead of Drogon, who was on the ground right in front of him, as ""bad/lazy writing"".  The excuse for not killing the men stranded on the rock or Dany when she comes to their rescue is ""plot armor"". You would think after 7 seasons there would be a little more patience for things that don't make sense at first. 

So far, only Targaryens ride dragons, correct? Plus Drogon had already formed a bond with Dany allowing her to ride him so perhaps the NK chose Vicerion (sp) by design. Remember we don't know his motive yet or if he's pure evil etc. He proved how strong and accurate he was with that ice spear so he could have taken down all of them. I also think his final throw was more of a warning toss as he's super magical and not one to miss. 

I could go on but the main point is until it's over,  we can't blame anything on ""bad writing"" because it could be one of those ""aha! That's why that happened!"" moments later on. ",gameofthrones,True,1533351526,2018-08-03

[SPOILERS] - Who else is Reek?,"Ramsay captures and physically and psychologically tortures Theon, turning him into Reek.

I've always wondered... would this be Ramsay's play with any character he captured? Could any character be broken down to Reek?

I think it's notable that Ramsay initially frees Theon and learns his story, especially his internal identity conflict of Stark/Greyjoy and his guilt of killing and burning the farm boys and betraying Robb. He uses these bits of information while later breaking Theon down into Reek. Learning of Theon's internal conflict and emotional weakness may have inspired Ramsay to torture and manipulate him instead of flaying him alive and killing him.

Characters that come to my mind are Jon, Jorah, Sandor, Jamie, Dany, Arya, and Cersei. Maybe that kind of brutality is impossible to withstand, but I just have a hard time seeing these characters sink to that level - especially Sandor and Cersei. These characters are simply too stubborn and tough to submit to ""Reek"". At the very least, they would take their first chance to kill him.

**Question: Would Ramsay torture and break down any character into Reek? Could Jon, Jorah, Sandor, Jamie, Dany, Arya, or Cersie become Reek?**

[SPOILERS] Euron is loyal for now ...,"You probably remember the conversation between Cersei and Tycho Nestoris in S7. Cersei points out that she has the most powerful armada , but Tycho says that it's Euron's armada and that he's loyal as long as it suits him.

That brings me to the question if Euron will at some point betray Cersei? 

We know that his original plan was to seduce Daenerys and when that didn't work he went for Cersei. So Cersei is obviously the second choice here. 

He also wants the most beautiful woman in the world and let's face it's not Cersei. 

It might just be me , but Euron looked impressed by Dany and her dragons in the dragon pit . 

As Tycho said , Euron is loyal for now. He is not a honourable guy and everything he does he does for himself.

I'm personally not a fan of Euron betraying Cersei because it contributes little to the story and Cersei should be the final human villain. 
But taking into consideration what we know about Euron , it is a possibility that he will move against Cersei.

What do you think , will Euron betray Cersei?

[Spoilers] Why do you think the show writers dislike Jon as a character so much?,"After reading the millionth thread about fans hating Daenerys, I thought I would shake things up a bit.  Daenerys is much more self-aware and mature on the shows than in the books.  She gets alot of leadership development while in the books she is a well-meaning airhead.  Jon, by contrast, is a shell of his character on the book.  It isn't that he sometimes makes mistakes and needs help, but that he never does anything right.  He doesn't even understand basic politics and military strategy and people spend most of their time making fun of him.  He is the farthest thing from a hero?

[SPOILERS] What are your top 3 episodes?,"I'm having serious withdrawals and need to talk about GoT with people

So I'll start with my 3 favorite episodes.

*3. ""Kissed by Fire,"" Season 3, ep. 5*
I couldn't tell you what else goes on in this episode, but the scene where Jaime explains why he killed the Mad King is some of the best acting I've ever seen, and the scene was incredibly powerful. It also was really the beginning of Jaime's character arc into a ""good guy.""

*2. ""Hardhome,"" Season 5, ep. 8*
This episode was incredible cinematography. When Jon's sword hit the Whitewalker's blade and the reverberating sound happened. When Jon and the Night King stared each other down. Wew lad. It gave me chills.

""1. ""Battle of the Bastards,"" Season 6, ep. 9.*
Where do I even start? The battle was incredible. Plus the picture of Jon drawing his sword with the cavalry charging him is my screensaver. One of the best images in modern cinematography. Tormund biting out throats. Wun Wun tearing people in half. Knights of the Vale cutting through the Bolton army like butter. Ramsay getting his face broken by Jon. Sansa releasing Ramsay's own dogs on him. Probably the best hour of cinematography ever. 

So... what are your favorites?

[SPOILERS] Who do you think are/were the top three fighters in Game of Thrones?,"In terms of fighters, for me, anyways, I felt initially that the choice would stand out to me but the more I thought about it, the more conflicted I was, so after like a week, here are my top three:

3. Jaime Lannister (+ his right hand)

Jaime was already well-respected by the people of Westeros as a legendary fighter and with that hell of a fight he had with Ned Stark and his men, he definitely in my top three. The reason he isn't any higher is because...well, you'll see.

Shame about the hand though.

1 upvote = 1 prayer for Jaime's hand.

cAn wE hiT 3 uPvOtEs iF wE dO i'LL kiLL cErSEi lol jK i wOn'T oWo



2. Oberyn Martell (The Red Viper)

Oh, Oberyn, where do I start? Well, you can evidently see his fighting prowess in that fight against Gregor Clegane (geddit? see- okay too soon), what with all that spinning and such. He's also the proud wearer of half a maester's chain, his specialisation being poisons, a weapon never to be underestimated, especially in Westeros, what with all the delightful weddings and such. 

Personally, to me, Oberyn is a fighter who's not only great with a spear or a sword, like some of the other rival fighters in the realm, he's smart as well, though sometimes a little...cocky.

👀

and finallyyyyy, drumroll please......



1. Arya Stark

Okay don't scream at me in the comments but I really think Arya is one of the few who truly understand combat, as not some contest of brute strength (ahem ahem Gregor) or merely a battle of slow but delicate strikes. 

She balances between the two, light on her feet when in a fight, dodging swings while counterattacking swiftly, making up for her somewhat small stature with her speed.

Her fight with Brienne is a great example of her skill, and given that she either won/drew (depending on how you look at it), that's something nobody would have foreseen.

That she would beat Brienne of Tarth, who bested both the Hound and Loras Tyrell (though not without some difficulty). 

That she would beat Brienne of Tarth, a member of Renly Baratheon's Rainbow Guard.

That she would beat Brienne of Tarth, who has trained her whole life to become a warrior.

Arya has a headstrong, determined character, but even so she does not let this determination blind her in combat. To call it combat would be underselling it.

She learnt to dance the water-dance, just as Syrio Forel, who taught her all those years ago in King's Landing, did. She lived up to the true legacy, became what she always wanted to become.

And perhaps between all the battles and poisonings, between the chewed throats and crushed eyeballs, maybe that really is the beauty of Game of Thrones.

[SPOILERS] The Night King and the dragons,"So, I just recently rewatched Beyond the Wall, and there's something I've been wondering. It seemed like, to me, that the Night King was fully prepared to kill one of the dragons. They brought the ice lances seemingly for this reason. Do you think he somehow planned for Danny to show up so he could get a dragon to destroy the wall?  If so, how?",gameofthrones,True,1533506105,2018-08-05
[SPOILERS] Jon Snow prediction,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1533509065,2018-08-05
[Spoilers] prophecy,"Just wanted to bounce off the idea about the Azor Ahai / Lightbringer Prophecy 

I come from the thought that the prophecy and history isn’t accurate after 8,000 years of re-telling and instead of like fate it’s a fulfillment of the prophecy through following the way the AA defeated the Others because it’s the only way to defeat them

“Azor Ahai ​is a legendary figure in the faith of R'hllor, the Lord of Light. Thousands of years ago, he forged the sword Lightbringer which he used to defeat the darkness of the Great Other. This came at a price, however, as in order to unleash the sword's true powers he had to plunge it into the heart of his loving wife, Nissa Nissa. A prophecy foretells that he will be reborn as The Prince That Was Promised.[1]”- Fandom wiki 

Theories 
- Jon Snow will get the Azor Ahai reborn label by the end of the series 
- The original AA- The problem with the swords was how to get a sword to defeat the dead come back / The Others which lead to the conclusion of how to work dragon glass into swords and it was trial and error. First he uses steal and it’s no good, then he realizes it needs to be dragon glass etc. 
- The things he plunged his sword into were killed/ dead/ re animated by the knight king / the Others / White walkers whatever they were called back then to stop them. And that the “living heart” line is a red herring or a miss tell throughout   History and had to be plunged through a dead/ living heart which is why it’s been tolled wrong because the complexity of the line isn’t remembered correctly. The person is dead and controlled by the Others so it’s talking about a reanimating that he kills 
- Jon uses his Targaryen magic to awaken dragons from “Stone” of winter fell - this is just something I think because of all the talks about his heritage and the crypts that fits into the prophecy of waking dragon from stone 
- Danny dies in battle and becomes reanimated and Jon Snow once they’ve figured out dragon glass swords has to kill her and defeats the Others.
- I think throughout the show we’ve seen Jon / Sam figuring out about dragon glass killing the Others while the old AA had to be the original maker and it took him forever I think with Sams help it’ll happen faster 
-but not in time to save Danny or winterfell. And instead of the knights king going down to King’s landing and destroying it , it’s Danny. 

So basically getting the glass to not break and in sword and arrows form in mass will save them as it did in the past but “at a cost” as it’s to late to save those who already died 
- and the reason the children of the forest don’t have / know this weaponry in the first men / AA didn’t trust them as they too found out the children of the forest created the Others in the first place 


Anyway all this was just floating in my head and I’ve written it out like word vomit

Is Mace Tyrell really an oaf?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1533516931,2018-08-05
[NO SPOILERS] Is Mace Tyrell really an oaf?,"While watching S5E9 “The Dance of Dragons” I noticed that Mace Tyrell said something rather intelligent while talking to Tycho of the Iron Bank that made me question the mindless portrayal of his character throughout the prior few seasons.

Mace: Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense of course.

Tycho: I’m glad we see eye to eye on that matter.

Mace: Did you know that Maegor the Third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest everyone charging interest and cut off both their hands.

Tycho: Most unfortunate for the glovers.

Mace: If a man charges no interest on a loan, then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why chance it? Whereas the compromise of reward makes a man willing to gamble.

Tycho: We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

Mace: You are the world’s best gamblers, and all those bets you won built this. (motions towards Iron Bank building)

The conversation itself shows that Mace has a good knowledge of history and finances, but the last line is really what gets me. Mace Tyrell might be somewhat eccentric and even docile, but it would take someone with a keen intellect to throw out that observation into a conversation out of nowhere, especially when it could work in his favor when negotiating the crown’s debt. 

Then again he starts singing like a damn fool afterwards so there’s that. Anyway I just thought that was interesting.",gameofthrones,True,1533517844,2018-08-05

[SPOILERS] A White Walkers theory,"I have this theory since season 4 came out. SPOILERS AHEAD.
If you paid attention to the Summer/Winter cycles in the GOT world we may assume that the planet is orbiting it's sun on a ecliptical orbit but 6 times slower than Earth . This causes the longer summers and winters on the planet. In the books and series so far we saw mentions of only 4 major continents Essos, Westeros, Sothoryos and Ulthos, but haven't seen even a glimpse of what lies on the other side of the Known world. So i can speculate that their planet enters a phase in which the dark side of the world now turns against the sun so the white walkers who resides on the other side must invade the light side in order to survive. So i also assume that on the other side of the Known worlds lies the realm of the walkers with their own kingdoms.

"1Game of Thrones (original) posits: The number of Stark troops were low entering the Fray (Walder). I propose that a force small enough to be defeated by the Fray' (though caught unawares and oblivious to Fray betrayal/slaughter, as was I) with a force no larger than that of Stannis' at Blackwater","1. [continued] ... (before and after Wildfire the number difference is significant.  Neither the Starks alone nor Stannis alone (as was the case) could conquer King's Landing.  I propose that the only possible path leading towards victory involves a Stark offer to Stannis' after the death of Renly. The offer consists simply of the restoration of the deal implemented by Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark, which ended in the first season/book, but now with Robert's brother Stannis instead now.
Just go back to the way things were before Ned died.  
    This possibly renders the Fray actions inconsequential if alternately instead Starks pass through the Twins' fray unharmed, instead Starks attacking King's Landing and losing after Stannis lost, facing the same troops that Stannis faced at the end of Blackwater Bay battle, defeated by Tywin Lannister Casterly Rock troops along with the soldiers iniitially involved in the defense of the city.  Rob Stark would have lost in King's Landing regardless.  With the same amount of troops of Stannis post- wildfire, climbing walls and storming the castle. Perhaps the Stark master war strategist along with intimate knowledge of King's Landing tunnels, (with the wildfire stunt already used and unreapatable), would Rob Stark defeat Lannisters?  Nobody knows...
        I posit that a Stark-Stannis team up would have almost guaranteed defeat of Lannisters, definitely the best odds of victory (Rob bends a knee?),  Starks would have otherwise done this with Renly, had demon-baby not been born.  This proposal looks at a battle around the time of Blackwater Bay pitting Starks and Stannis' militaries combining forces versus Kings' Landing defense forces
during that battle.  The show hints at this possible outcome with Renly's forces joining Stark, as well as the possibility of Lady Stark's plea for brotherly peace. 
  For simplicities sake, let's say Stannis and Stark teamed up after Renly's death.  Assuming Stannis would take the good deal proposed by Stark, beneficial and acceptable for both sides, if he's at all practical, assuming he chooses the advice of Onion Knight smuggler over Crazy Red Lady, (who really had her grips in him at this point).  Stannis ruling with the King in the North having autonomy up there. 
     This unfolds later as a better defense versus whitewalkers, with Stannis learning of the army of the dead and then all Westeros troops sent to the Wall to fight whitewalkers. What happens at Dragonstone with Khalleesi  dealing with Stannis in control? I feel that she wouldn't bother the North, them having integrity and all and love of their people, she'd leave them be.  She wouldn't to Stannis, so Starks are honorbound to fight her. [Late Chaotic unorganized Beethoven rough beast Damien writings or ramblings] Before that though, Munce raider takes Castle Black before running into Stannis' troops south of the wall, after wreaking havoc on the upper North. Then John maybe dies and no knowledge of whitewalkers believed by anyone, knowledge dying with theWatchers on the Wall if John Snow doesn't survive...Munce respects him, idk (it's a messier less clean posited alternate reality, the original writing seemed cleaner.) 

2.  Tyrion's honest truthful explanation during his trial of actions and convincing  of deeply held love for Shea: ""Come on babe, I love you still more than anyone ever. As a man a few weeks said to you, you will die if you stay here , by that man! (Mistrial!) I was saving your life, never touched Sanza. What really happenend Shea?  (Probably wouldn't have mattered even if it happened). She don't care about royalty and titles, just love.

3.  On societal qualified leaders seeking World Influence and Power, such as Eddard Stark fighting for the throne instead of Robert.  The outcome is a King ruling Westeros from love of citizens, not ruling through fear and lies, manipulation and force.  The best possible leader for the people gaining and holding Power thus does occur.  Out of duty for the best World if he rules, he opposingly to his nature ruthlessly and through trickery and manipulation gains the Iron Throne, then rules it unharmed as he rules the North, with well earned respect of the people.  Uniting opposites is the solution to most issues/problems I've contemplated.  Through self mastery and temperance , powerful polaric forces are integrated into one cohesive whole in man with a heart of gold, aware of all possible potentials of himself and man, able to control at will any possible human response, no matter how polarized, and wisely choosing when to masterfully appropriately apply any facet of human behavior. This is a king!  This involves Ned playing the Game of Thrones and winning, his soldiers more loyal than those fighting for those they do not love.  In foresight looking at possible future outcomes, he chooses that his rule would benefit people most in all of Westeros.  This action against his own nature benefits others most, him being of a broad potential, knowing the importance of his victory at all costs, avoiding other potentialities had other less quality rulers won instead.

[SPOILERS] Jon Snow V Daenerys Targaryen: Who would make the better ruler?,"I think this is a very interesting question, considering that both Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are obviously the two main protagonist. But who would be better suited for ruling over the seven kingdoms?

Well, first off, I just want to make one thing clear, I'm not against any of these characters and I have loved and enjoyed watching both of them grow. I've seen them make good decisions and I've also seen them make bad decisions. 

Also this will include things from the books and the TV show. I dont want to make this too long, so there's plenty of things and subjects that add on to each point. 

***Now, the way I seen JS and DT is as follows:***

* Jon is not self-appointed, or self-entitled. He wants to unite people, he wants to bring peace and he is forging alliances, not forcing them. He is willing to fight on the battlefield instead of making other people do it for him. He is respected, not feared. He is someone the people can follow. What makes the people on his side is his promise of peace, his promise of unity and his ability to lead. He looks like a leader, someone they can follow, and not someone who rules over them. He is not a tyrant. I also think that Jon knows how to follow, Dany does not.
* Dany is self entitled, she feels like she rule because she is the ""rightful heir."" She also wants to bring peace, she is forging alliances, but she is also trying to force them as well. She doesn't fight on the battle filed the same way as Jon does, mainly because she doesn't know how to and she would probably die in an instant. Instead what she does is uses her powerful armies and dragons to accomplish things, which isn't her fault I suppose. to me, she looks more like someone who wants power for the wrong reasons.

One of the main differences between Jon and Dany is the fact that she tells people she should be the queen, Jon on the other hand has other people basically telling him that he should be king. This shows that people view Jon as a king, who not only would make a good king, but someone who the people can trust. 

The conversation between Varys and Kevan Lannister, talking about the difference between Tommen and Aegon, also sort of fits the difference between Daenerys and Jon:

“Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.”

Daenerys isn’t a good queen, for the same reason that Robert wasn’t - she doesn’t recognise that it’s a duty rather than a right.

***To answer this question though I do believe JS is better suited for the job.***

He saved thousands of people, managed to find lands for them to settle on and food to feed them. He knows how to unite people for a common cause, and aims for a long term peace that will benefit everyone. Jon is fair and compassionate, yet can still be assertive and just when he needs to. Most importantly, he can see the big picture and is never out for himself.

Dany on the other hand has good intentions, but her decisions are often short-sighted. She wants to abolish slavery, yet has no idea how to replace such a well established system. She has caused plenty of deaths and destructions that could have been avoided in the first place. She wants the throne because she believes it’s hers by right, not because she wants the people in Westeros to have a better life. And she has no prospects of how to rule the Seven Kingdoms once she has taken it. Dany has a reputation of being a bad ruler, and on the show it has only been improved with the help of Tyrion. 

She barely cares of the consequences of her acts , because in her mind she’s always fair and just and thus has no long-termed vision. She didn’t think of an alternative economic system when she ended slavery. Tyrion did it for her. She apparently believes it’s a great idea to bring an army of rapist on Westeros, but once again she didn’t think of the possible negative consequences. She wants her damned crown and that is the only thing that matters.

***Daenerys' Issues that makes her a bad candidate.***

Unlike her father Dany is not an evil person, she’s a good hearted woman with a big sense of Justice. However she clearly lacks of ruling skills. She doesn’t have the patience nor the humility, she just has the army and a very clever adviser but I wouldn’t call that a “personal quality”.

* She’s too pride to admit her mistakes or her family’s mistakes. she kept blaming everthing on the “Usurpers’ dog”, until Tyrion shut her mouth. She starts to listen though ( at least on the TV show)
* She barely cares of the consequences of her acts , because in her mind she’s always fair and just and thus has no long-termed vision. She didn’t think of an alternative economic system when she ended slavery. Tyrion did it for her. She apparently believes it’s a great idea to bring an army of rapist on Westeros, but once again she didn’t think of the possible negative consequences. She wants her damned crown and that is the only thing that matters.
* Whether a ruler controls his region through honour, respect or fear those decisions they make must be firm as well as consistent. Stannis is not a man who could inspire men to him nor charm his way to power, but those who do follow him respect him because of his unflinching ways. He hands out punishment and reward in the measure warranted by the action of those under him. And when he commits to something he does not shirk from it, regardless of how tasteless it might be. Daenerys's sense of justice has not been so strict, but more to her own personal whims. When angered she tortured the wine sellers family, but then when challenged by the harpies she refused to kill her hostages. While this may have been the ethically right thing to do it has made her look weak in the eyes of her enemies and in some of her commanders. A ruler who is not firm will rule an uneasy kingdom.

As mentioned previously, I see a parallel between her story and King Robert’s. Robert Baratheon was an outstanding warrior, a conqueror, the “Khal Drogo of Westeros” like Jorah Mormont said, but in the end he revealed himself a terrible king. Fortunately Jon Arryn was here to save his ass, the same way Tyrion is here to save hers. That’s the point of Dany’s character. Unlike Jon, she wasn’t meant to lead or be a good and wise leader, she was meant to conquer with “fire and blood.”

***Final thoughts!***

Jon has done everything Daenerys had done but better in my opinion. He didn't have 3 huge dragons, he didn't have a huge powerful army like she did. She fell in love with Jon because she has seen first hand that there is someone out there who is just better than her. She even didn't think she deserved Jon's loyalty we he finally bent the knee.

[SPOILERS] Another unasked for and unprofessional ranking of the Game of Thrones seasons.,"First off I’d like to say that I love all of Game of Thrones. I don’t mean to offend anyone so these opinions are only my opinions. I kind of feel bad about nitpicking such a great show, but oh well let’s do it. 

(7th) Season 7

Man, that loot train battle was amazing. The battle at sea where Euron attacks Dany’s armada was pretty awesome as well. There were some spectacular moments in Season 7, but overall it just didn’t feel like Thrones to me. The pacing was jarringly off and the decision to grab a white walker to convince Cersei to join the real war didn’t make much sense in the believability of the story or the believability of the characters who made that decision. The Arya/Sansa tension seemed unnecessary (and again unbelievable), and Littlefinger’s death was an anticlimactic end to such a clever character arc. It also seems (unbelievable) that he would have not seen it coming. Also the scene where all the main characters were walking together in Episode 7 was pretty cheesy, as was Jon calling Dany “Dany” out of nowhere.

(6th) Season 5

I honestly love Season 5. I’ve gotten weird looks for saying that, but I do. It may not be the most eventful season, but it’s a season of adventure. Arya travels to Bravos to join the faceless men, something I’ve been wanting to happen since Season 2. Tyrion travels all the way across Essos. We get to see Volantis for the first time. We get to see Valyria and some all-out stone men. Also, Hardhome. That’s all I need to say about that. A lot actually changes in Season 5. The main reason I have it this far back is because the pace slows down a lot from Seasons 1-4 and it doesn’t seem believable to me that Baelish would think wedding Sansa to Ramsay would be advantageous to Sansa or himself in the long run. On top of all that, it becomes apparent in Episode 1 that Daenerys is yet again going to spend another full season in Essos. Watching while being aware of that takes away a lot of the surprise.

(5th) Season 6

Season 6 is bright when it dazzles and dull at all other times. If I rated this season based on Episodes 9 and 10 alone, it would get first place. Battle of the Bastards was spectacular and the beginning sequence to “The Winds of Winter” was so creepy and melancholic that it seemed like it’s own little show inside of Thrones. The revelation of Hodor’s backstory and how it fits in with the present was one of the few things that actually surprised me from the recent seasons, and I thought it was great. However, Season 6 draws out many storylines that should have been wrapped up by the end of Season 5. This includes Arya spending a full season doing exactly what she did the prior season with no progress to show for it in the end, the High Sparrow story arc talking about mercy and justice for another season while barely anything changes within the city, and of course another season where we realize all too early that Dany is going to be in Essos all the way through again.

(4th) Season 3

Season 3 is good stuff, but I think it was overly hyped up at the time. The Red Wedding is probably the most infamous scene in all of Thrones. It caught me by complete surprise. It haunted me the next week after I watched it while I was walking to class or sitting in lectures. That’s why it was great, because it made all of us want to tear our hair out. Overall though, Season 3 wasn’t too exciting throughout. Since it’s the first half of A Storm of Swords, it doesn’t close up many subplots and there just aren’t a lot of notable things that happen. However, it shows Westeros in a different light then we see in Seasons 1 and 2. We get to meander through the torn up riverlands with Arya as she meets the Brotherhood, and also with Brienne and Jaime on their unfortunate travel situation back to King’s Landing. Those Brienne/Jaime scenes were a very strong highlight of the season, seeing the two polar opposites slowly form a bond and hearing Jaime’s account of what really happened all those years ago with his sword and the king’s back. Also Jon and Ygritte have cave sex and Dany’s mastermind decision making where she leaves Astapor with her dragons AND her army is badass.

(3rd) Season 2

Season 2 is classic Thrones; the political intrigue, the adventures of main characters through uncharted lands, the ominous mysteries of comets and birds with too many eyes, the War of the Five Kings. We get to explore north of the Wall for the first time. We get to meet the crazy red-haired lady and learn of the Lord of Light. We get to see Arya begin her journey as the free soul that she is. We get to see Tyrion manipulate manipulators and cut beards off of old people. We get to see baby dragons and the beginning of the best romance of the show (Jon and Ygritte). The crazy thing is, Season 2 might actually be less exiting than Seasons 6 or 7 in the big scope of things. Not too much happens in the first half of the season, but once the Nightman murders Renly and the first of the five kings dies, everything becomes more intriguing. Even in the first few episodes though, the pace is quick and we get to learn more about the world these characters are living in. I didn’t enjoy Qarth very much, but nonetheless this was a solid season through and through.

(2nd) Season 1

Ah Season 1. Probably the most underrated season of them all. It’s easy to get further on in any series and claim the beginning as old news, but I think a lot of people forget how truly amazing this season is. Watching the first few episodes again is a great experience, seeing all these main characters together as the story begins. These episodes also deftly manage introducing the immensity of characters and Westerosi history with ease. And when we saw Ned Stark get beheaded we found out we were truly watching something unlike anything we’ve seen before.

(1st) Season 4

Season 4. Damn. What a thriller. Joffrey dies in Episode 2?? I mean give me some time to breathe at least. Even before that we get to see the best character intro out of the entire series, Oberyn. And then Tyrion walks in, sees him pull his dagger out of another man’s wrist, and then watches as Oberyn starts making out with his main chick. This season shines with glory. There is a sense of urgency throughout that comes from the fact that the capital is loaded with people from all over the Seven Kingdoms. At first because of the royal wedding, but then because of Tyrion’s incarceration. The entire trial sequence was nothing short of amazing and brilliantly showed the inner workings of King’s Landing. Of course there’s Episode 9 which proved itself entirely fulfilling and cemented itself as the best battle up until that point. And then everything ends with a bang. Lysa Arryn. Oberyn and The Mountain. Tywin and Shae. Damn. 

That’s all! Don’t know why I decided to do this. Just felt inspired.",gameofthrones,True,1533575693,2018-08-06

[SPOILERS] What If Jon Snow Is A Twin ??,"I was thinking about the scene that shows jon snows birth and when his parents are shown getting married. 

What if Jon was a twin and before Ned Stark got to the tower where Lyanna gave birth maybe has twin was born first and inherited their fathers genes of the Targenan ; the white hair, purple eyes. And Lyanna knew that Ned couldn't pass that child as his so she sent that child away, but Jon having darker hair and eyes meant that Ned could raise his as his own child 

This would mean that Jon would be the song of ice and his twin the song of fire 

If this was to happen then Jon could stay King in the North and his Twin ( been the first born of the two) could sit on the iron throne 

(I know this won't be true but think about it would that make a bit of sense)

"[SPOILERS] Assuming early April'19 release of the S8E1, expect the first promo poster this September, teaser this December, and trailer in February'19 (based on past timeline)","Not sure why, but had a bad case of missing GoT this Monday, so decided to take a look at the difference between the air date for each season, and respective poster / teaser / trailer release dates in order to pinpoint when to expect S8 material. Due to such a small sample size, my dates aren't perfect, but it's better than nothing or just pure speculation.

http://prntscr.com/kfh8tn

I didn't include anything for S1 on purpose, as marketing material for the brand new show probably had different release schedule. If someone is aware of official poster / teaser / trailer that was released before any of the dates that I have, please let me know so I could adjust accordingly.

Assuming early Apr'19 release date, we might see the first poster in September / October, first teaser in November / December (possibly Thanksgiving on November 22?), and the first official trailer in February (SuperBowl 53 falls on February 3, probably the best timing). That being said, S8 is the last season, so I can see HBO pushing hard on marketing.",gameofthrones,True,1533590511,2018-08-06
[SPOILERS] Danaerys is going to die,"Seeing how there are pretty frequently posts about how GOT ends where people think Danaerys makes it to the end, I just want to remind everyone of this trend in GOT:

* Jon's mom died in childbirth
* Tyrion's mom died in childbirth
* Danaerys' mom died in childbirth

Notice a pattern? Is there any mother still alive in the show (aside from Cersei)? Mothers don't fare well in Game of Thrones, they either die in childbirth (see above) or are doomed to watch their children die and suffer (Catelyn, Cersei, Olenna, Elaria).

I'm pretty sure Danaerys will die giving birth to a child, just in line with one of the common themes.

What really concinced me of this idea is the prophecy of Mirri Maz Duur:

&gt;“When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. **When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.**”

This also matches the [vision Dany has in the House of the Undying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7VuGknEfQY), where she almost reaches the iron throne, but instead goes north and (symbolically) goes into the afterlife.

To me, Danaerys is pretty dead.",gameofthrones,True,1533590941,2018-08-06

[Spoilers] You guy's got it all wrong. Daenerys Targaryen isn't the hero you think she is. She is going to end up as the villain.,"I've been holding onto this theory after reading A Dance with Dragons a few years ago. Daenerys is barely holding onto her sanity. If she didn't have the wise council from her followers she would have crucified and burned thousands of people in Mereen. She is ruthless killing hundreds people just for not agreeing to follow her. She has stated repeatedly she will take what is her's through fire and blood. Dany is her father's daughter for sure and now that she is getting older her worst fears have begun to come true and she starts hearing whispers and have vilolent outbursts just like her father the Mad King. She leds an invasion army consisting of monsters, mercenaries, raiders, slaves, and a horde of Dothraki. She burns the Tarly's just for not bending the knee. Now she has lost one of her ""children"" and will probably be even more ruthless in getting what she wants.

Now looking at season 8 this is how I think things will play out. Jon and Dany have fallen in love, but Jon has not seen the Mad side of her yet. When they arrive at Winterfell they will be greeted by Jamie Lannister and Bronn hoping to join forces. Do you really think Daenerys will just be like ""ok hey you killed my dad and tried to kill me but no biggie lets team up lol?"" She'll imprison him thinking he will try to betray her. Tyrion will be furious and try everything to get her to release his brother, but Daenerys will refuse threatening to kill Tyrion along with his brother. Jamie will be sentenced to death by dragon fire. Jon will finally get to see Bran again who will tell him who his mother and father are and that his real name is Aegon Targaryen and the he not Dany is the rightful ruler of Westeros. Jon will also figure out that means Dany is his aunt and is unable to have children. Jamie will be locked in a cage awaiting his execution at dawn but will be visited by his brother Tyrion and Bronn repaying his brother by releasing him like Jamie did for him. This is the 2nd betrayal. Jamie reveals that the young woman Tyrion married was not a whore but actually loved him, and Tywin ordered his men to rape her instead of her willingly sleeping with them for gold. She was unable to live with herself and jumped to her death. Jamie escapes with Bronn's help but Tyrion stays behind hoping to somehow change Danys mind. Instead she will have Tyrion burned in place of his brother despite the council of all her followers. This is the moment the audience will turn on her.

Jamie hearing of his brother's death returns to Winterfell with Bronn helping him sneak in to avenge Tyrion's death. Jon finds them first and earlier being told of Bran's ""climbing accident"". Jon, Jamie, and Bronn fight in the courtyard of Winterfell. Jon's experience fighting in the North helps him tremendously as Jamie and Bronn struggle to fight in the snow. Jamie is badly wounded but Bronn refuses to give up finally for once in his life fighting for something other than gold but to avenge his friend. Jon outmatches Bronn who won't fall for his tricks and falls to Jon's blade. Jamie is recaptured for the final time and burned alive. Cersei hearing of Jamie's death sends everything she has at Winterfell. Dany begins to go even more mad as an army led by Euron arrives at Winterfell and a navy at Dragonstone. Another battle for the north happens along with the Clegane brothers finally meeting in battle. Euron takes down Dany's second dragon with the giant crossbow while Jon is riding him. Thinking her lover and dragon is dead Dany goes beserk burning everything on both sides killing Euron but also destroying most of her army in the process. She is not done though, next she seeks vengance against Cersei flying to King's Landing by burning the Red Keep. Little do they know the Mad King had plans many years back to destroy King's Landing by hiding Wildfire caches everywhere. The fire from her Drogon ignites a chain reaction destroying most of King's Landing and burnings the Red Keep to the ground with Cersei sitting in the Iron Throne clutching her pregnant belly. 

Jon survives but Rhaegal is dead. He mounts a horse and chases after Dany but arrives to a burnt ruin of King's Landing. With snow falling he arrives at the remains of the Red Keep and finds Dany sitting on the throne surrounded by bones, ash, and snow. Dany is practically shouting ""I burned them, I burned them all Jon! All of our enemies!"" Jon is horrified and reminded of the stories of the Mad King. She gets out of her ruined throne and runs to embrace Jon. But Jon slowly unsheathes his sword and as Dany runs to his arms he pierces her in the heart with tears running down his face. Dany stares at him with Mad Eyes asking ""Why?"" ""For the kingdom"" he proclaims. Dany still holding onto Jon takes her last breath and Jon screams in agony. This is the 3rd and last betrayal. Jon stands with Daenery's lifeless body still clinging to her in his arms. He let's her go pulling the sword from her heart. Longclaw suddenly bursts into flames. Jon is Azor Ahai, forced to kill his love in order to temper his blade Lightbringer. Jon stands there in the burned throne room filled with snow and ash holding the flaming sword of legend as the last living dragon roars but is stopped and now controlled by Bran. 

The survivors of Danys battlefield massacre are holding up in Winterfell but will soon be overrun by the undead. Jon arrives wielding a flaming sword flying Drogon/Bran and fighting 2 undead dragons and a horde of zombies. Events happen and soon he finds himself face to face with the Night's King. They fight epically and Jon slays the Night King with his sword of legend but falls himself mortally wounded. All the undead crumble in their tracks as the remaining survivors huddle together in their final stand. The last Targaryen and ancestor of Valyria lays on his back watching the snowy clouds fade away allowing a beam of sunlight to lightly fall on his face. Jon takes his last breath as the snow stops falling all over Westeros.

[SPOILERS] Jon Snow and Sansa Stark foreshadowing from the TV show,"I am going t point out everytime the show foreshadowed a possible relationship between Jon and Sansa from season 1 to 7:


* S1E1 - The first scene with Sansa and Lady Catelyn in Sansa’s room. In this scene she tells her mom that she wants to go south to marry Joffrey and be his queen. The next scene is Jon talking to uncle Benjen, where he tells his uncle that he wants to join the Nights Watch and he doesn’t care about wife or kids.

'


* S1E4 – Sansa and Septa Mordane visit the Throne room. This scene was written specially for the show, its not in the books. She tells Sansa that **“one day your husband will sit there, and you will sit by his side”.** 

'


* S1E5 – Sansa receives a rose from Ser Loras at the Hand of the King Tournament. Just like her aunt Lyanna Stark a few years ago at the Harrenhall Tournament. 


'


* S1E9 – Jon Snow goes see Maetser Aemon at his command. Maester Aemon knows Jon is being tempted to leave the Nights Watch to be with his brother Robb and fight in the war for his father’s life. Aemon tells Jon his own personal drama and gives him a speech over **Love and Duty.** Maester Aemon: ""Did you ever wonder why the men of the Nights Watch take the “No wife, no children vows”? So that they will not love. Love is the death of duty.""   


'

* S2E4 – Joffrey order the Kingsguard to beat Sansa in the Throne Room after Robb defeats this armies on the battlefield. The knight rips apart her dress and leaves her almost naked. Tytion stops the assault and order someone to cover her up. [We see Sansa being cloaked by the Hound, with the blue winter rose](http://static.wixstatic.com/media/2177cc_ead555d6403b4b5fb65c5b676758d992.png/v1/fill/w_491,h_275,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/2177cc_ead555d6403b4b5fb65c5b676758d992.png) (Jon) right behind her. This blue rose was showed just a few times during the show. 

'


* S2E7 – Sansa gets her first period and its invited by Cersei into her room for a talk. Cersei tells her that: ""Permit me to share some women wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You will do things for them that you know you shouldn’t do. You will act like the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."" Thats almost the same speech Maester Aemon gave to Jon Snow 

'



* SEASON 3 - This season will be a very interesting parallel between Jon and Sansa. In the beginning of the season, Jon will be forced to lie and pretend to be a wildling, the enemies of the North. Sansa in the end of this season, will be forced to marry a Lannister, the enemies of House Stark.


'


* S3E7 – Margaery takes Sansa for a walk in the gardens and tries to cheer her up about her marriage to Tyrion. She gives Sansa a sex advices and explains to her that “women are quite complicated and that its takes practice to please us”. The next scene Jon Snow is receiving sex advices from Tormound. He tells Jon Snow that “Most men fuck like dogs… you need to be patient, give time, your cock shouldn’t be near her until she is slick as a baby seal”. He tells Jon that he needs to be gentle. 


'



* S5E4 – Jon Snow, now Lord Commander, is sending letters to the Lords of the North asking men for the Nights Watch. The first name of the list is **LORD ASHFORD**. Later in the episode we have Sansa on the crypts of Winterfell lighting a candle for her aunt Lyanna Stark. In this scene Littlefinger is telling her about the  famous Harrenhall Tournment, where Rheagar gave a blue rose to Lyanna Stark. This is a special nod to the Ashford Theory. 


'


* S6E4 – Jon and Sansa are reunited at Castle Black. In the scene inside Jon’s room in front of the fire place, Sansa is wearing Jon’s old cloak. The grey one he used to wear at Winterfell before taking the black. The act of cloaking a woman with his own cloak represents marriage in Westeros.

'

* S6E5- This time is Sansa who cloaks Jon with a Stark cloak that she made herself. 


'


* S6E2 –Jon decides to leave Winterfell and go to Dragonstone. In the crypts Littlefinger tells him that he loves Sansa and wants to marry her, Jon immediately assaults Littlefinger and tells him that he will kill him if he touches Sansa. After they leave the crypts, Littlefinger looks at Jon, and then looks at Sansa who is looking at Jon and starts to wonder.

'



* S7E6- Jon Snow tries to give back Longclaw to Jorah, but he refuses and tells Jon he was not a good sin to his father. He tells Jon:**""It may serve you well and your children after you.** Right after Jorah says this the Stark theme starts to play and the very next scene cuts to Winterfell to a scene with Sansa. 

'


* S7E7 – Littlefinger and Sansa are discussing Jon’s  raven informing of his decision to bend the knee to Daenerys Targaryen. Littlefinger is playing with a wooden Wolf and tells Sansa how Daenerys is a very beautiful woman. Sansa response: **""what that has to do with anything?""** That’s the same quote Arya used, when she was jealous of Gendry and Melisandre in season 3. Littlefinger was trying to make Sansa jealous because he sensed something was happening Jon and Sansa.

"[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones has every relatable character that has ever imagined, and it's why we love it.","I realized why we love and are obsessed with this story. It has written/introduced every walk of life there is. Every psychology. Every single personality that has ever imagined is in Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice &amp; Fire (and then developed them to their true potential). Let's give some examples:

First, the personalities and their character traits. There is introversion &amp; awkwardness (Jon Snow) and shyness &amp; being helpless (Daenerys). They both overcome all of those while being a bastard, a loner, or an outsider to become a Lord Commander/King in the North &amp; Khaleesi/Queen. We also see extroversion with great sense of humor (Tyrion) and depression (Bran Stark). 

Samwell Tarly, a guy who is fat, loves to read books and a coward, fought and killed the White Walker for the first time in thousands of years and then became one of the most knowledgable person in Westeros. There's a cynic (Edd), romantic (Pyp) and slow-witted (Grenn).

There's an honorable man (Ned) and a big liar (Cersei). There's also a tomboyish girl (Arya) who became a skilled assassin and a proper lady (Sansa/Margaery) who mastered the art of politics and governing. There's a sassy man/woman (Tywin/Olenna), and a strong &amp; independent man/woman (Tormund/Ygritte).

We see laziness (Tommen) and hardworking (Lyanna Mormont). We see loyalty (Podrick) and backstabber (Baelish). Foul-mouthed (Sandor) and discreet (Varys). There are bullies (Joffrey) and kind-hearted (Shireen). Rude people (Craster) and polite (Gilly).

Second, not only unique personality but it combines with some kind of deformity too. Bran Stark, an outgoing/climber kid who became a cripple, devoid of physical activities, discovered some mental abilities (Internet). There's a burned face, ugly face. A girl with greyscale. There's a smug guy who was humbled when he lost his hand. There's a Eunuch, I mean tons of eunuchs, and there's a very, very, very old woman. And so on...

Every personality, disorder, and physical/mental attribute is in Game of Thrones, and that is why we love it so much because it's so relatable and we understood all their actions, motives, and perspectives, because every one of us can see ourselves through them.

Who is the safest bet to be alive by the end of GOT,,gameofthrones,True,1532228211,2018-07-21
[Spoilers] Which characters are most likely to survive by the end of the show,"In a Year from now GOT will most likely be in its last season or coming to its end very soon and I just want to throw it out there. Which of the main characters are most likely to survive by the end of the show. (Let’s list em) 

Jon Snow 

Daenerys 

Tyrion 

Arya 

Sansa 

Jaime

Cersei

These are the highest priority people in the show right now so who do we think out of this list is most likely to make it out alive. 

I personally feel like if Vegas put odds on it I’d put my money on Arya. Jon and Dany are about as 50/50 as it goes. I think one of them is dying if not both by the end of the show. So they are way too risky. Jaime is dead and so is Cersei. Cersei is 100% dead while Jaime I’m putting at 90%. Tyrion is 3rd on who I think could make it back bcuz he always seems to find a way to survive. Sansa is 2nd here bcuz she would play nicely into the future of Westeros because she wanted to be a queen and I could see her being queen of the north at the end of the series if all of Westeros isn’t destroyed by the end of this series. 

I see Arya as the most important piece to the end game of thrones. I just have a feeling that dagger has a high significance towards the story. She’s been building to becoming this ultimate killer/hero type of person that I feel like her arch would be incomplete if she were to die in the final war. I could see it happen as I can with everyone on this list but I feel Arya is 1. Too young and 2. Is more of an important character to the story than Sansa. 

So my rankings goes as follows 

1. Arya 

2. Sansa 

3. Tyrion 

4. Jon 

5. Dany 

6. Jaime 

7. Cersei

1.) A non-linear opening set in the far future where a new monarch on a different throne reflects on the events in Season 8 as he/she passes a decree. The old wheel of power has taken a new form. 

2.) Again, a non-linear opening set in the near future with Dany covered in ashes, parts of her clothes scorched, and on her knees in the Great Hall of the Red Keep as everything begins to crumble around her. 

3.) The immediate aftermath of season 7's finale: birds and animals beginning to flee the region around the fallen section of the wall. The Starks can now see the dead army on the horizon that's advancing like a giant tsunami towards Winterfell. ",gameofthrones,True,1532249588,2018-07-22
"[Spoilers] So for many years I’ve heard the hype around this show and I finally got myself to watch it. After hearing all the reviews and everything surrounding the show, I truly believed that it was going to let me down because expectations were set so high.","The last three weeks I have come to learn that this show is everything I’ve ever wanted in a show and more. There are so many different character arcs and surprises and the writing has been superb. 

For me binge watching is extremely difficult and I find it hard to get into a show, so I rarely do. 

But I am a firm believer in peer reviews and critic scores and every time I checked IMDb for a new show to watch this was at the top every single time. I believe second was Breaking Bad and up until this show Breaking Bad was my all time favorite show and I couldn’t believe another show was supposedly better.

I came into this show with an open mind and it actually wasn’t what I was expecting at all. Somehow I had got the notion that dragons were prominent everywhere so I was expecting something like Reign of Fire but this show has truly blown me away. 

The acting was phenomenal I think the Hound might be my favorite supporting character, he has so many notable lines and he is truly one of the first to see the world as it is.

I think the biggest was when Brienne of Tarth says she’s going to protect Arya and bring her to safety and he says something along the lines of there is nowhere safe in this world everything she has is gone type of thing.

Then we he goes back to the hut and sees the man and daughter’s skeleton he really began to change. The conversation between him and Tormund when they are looking for the wight was one of my favorite dialogues, that was the only way to have a little light hearted fun added into a situation that they were getting themselves in.

Don’t even get me started on poor Jon, his entire life he had to grow up thinking he was a bastard and that he wasn’t good enough and so he set out to the Nights Watch because it was basically his only option and the only place he would be treated like anyone else.

Catelyn Stark will never know that her husband wasn’t a cheater and she died hating Jon and everything he was because it meant that Ned slept with someone else.

Ned tarnished his reputation to protect Jon and raised him like a son after fighting in a war that was almost entirely based on a lie. To top it all off he gets beheaded by a little shit swizzler for being following his best friends last request. But not only do they kill him, they make him confess to crimes that he never even committed.

I am truly afraid that season 8 is going to go Infinity War on our asses and start killing off the rest of our beloved characters left and right. I also wonder how Jon will feel about the fact that he slept with his Aunt. 

All in all, I have watched three serious shows that I have truly enjoyed Breaking Bad, House M.D and Game of Thrones and I never thought that this show would live up to expectations, but it has exceeded them in every way imaginable. I’m always late to the party. I didn’t watch Breaking Bad until after the final season, but I am glad I will be able to wait and enjoy the final season with all of the rest of you.

IS EURON THE FINAL VILLAIN?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1532255425,2018-07-22
[SPOILERS] IS EURON THE FINAL VILLAIN?,"is euron the final villain in game of thrones??

i am talking of a scenario where the night king would be defeated and killed first. and then euron would occupy king's landing and kingslanding could witness the final showdown between euron and basically everyone else, jon, jaime, tyrion, etc.

in the books, euron is portrayed as a terrifying dark lord. in the books, he is attributed with sorcery like powers and he is paving the ground for a massive bloodsacrifice to conjure up his mythical ironborn diety.

does this mean he could blow the whole of king's landing with wildfire?? ( and does it mean he wants to conjure up a mythical ironborn creature/diety for his evil plans of an ironborn empire)??

i think cersei inviting euron to make a common cause could be as disastrous(or even more) as she invited high sparrow for her short term goals. I do think that euron would turn against cersei and probably take her hostage. he might have the support of qyburn in this and with his help, he may uncover the location of wildfire stashes in kingslanding.

he could utilise this wildfire to blow up the whole of kingslanding. he may come up with a nasty plan, collect all his opponents in kingslanding and then blow it up. probably he is planning to blow the whole of kingslanding when the combined armies of jon, jaime enter the kingslanding. it could be lot like a battle for casterly rock scenario, where euron's men would be waiting in ships outside kingslanding and the main army gets trapped inside kingslanding.

also way back in 2017, pilau aesbak posted in Instagram his pic alongside an interviewquote *""after this season, Ramsay's gonna look like a little kid""*

Also he posted a new picture of his character euron in the show.

The image shows a shocking physical transformation of the character, who looks completely different to the Euron  in seasons 6 and 7.

his picture looks a lot more terrifying and is somewhat close to the terrifying dark lord version of euron in the books.

In the Instagram snap, Euron has a balding head with long, white locks of hair as well as a clean-shaven face.

In fact, Euron looks a lot more like his brother Balon Greyjoy (Patrick Malahide) but far more villanous, monstrous and terrifying.

heres the pic

[Euron VERSION SEASON 8](https://i.redd.it/ieozzj2w8hb11.jpg)

the above pic shows a more monstrous and villanous euron in contrast to the euron of season 6 and season 7.

if he really makes *ramsay look like a little kid,* as he says, then it means that he would be the final villain and far more dangerous than the night king.",gameofthrones,True,1532255552,2018-07-22

[SPOILERS] About Longclaw...,"There was some rumor about it being special when Jon pulled himself out of the water in S07E06. The eye of the wolf-pommel blinked somehow or opened or whatever.

Rewatching S07E07, when Cersei asks Jon to withold from the war for the truce, he declares himself already bound to Dany. Look at the wolf-pommel while he talks. It appears to be blinking as well.

[SPOILERS] My late S8 Predictions,"Okay so these are my final full predictions for S8, these are the predictions I am sticking with until I am proven wrong with the first trailer, Now before you start you are probably wondering (for anyone who read the other post anyways) “didn’t you post your predictions a few days ago?” yes I did, but those are more of highlights these are my full predictions. Which is why I will not be deleting them either (as they are similar minus two changes). Either way I will leave a link to them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8zx28z/spoilers_my_theoriespredictions_for_season_8/
Now let’s begin, my predictions are made up of my own ideas, the small amount of filming info I read, and one Leak that may not even be true:

-	After racing to Castle Black to inform Edd of Eastwatch Destruction, Tormund and Beric race on horse pack to WF to warn the Starks (and Jon once he arrives) as Edd chooses to stay and Defend the wall, him &amp; the rest of NW dies either marching too Eastwatch and trying to hold off the NK’s forces or NK brings down the rest of the Wall. Meanwhile in Wintertown the citizens are in fear after feeling the ground shake knowing what it means, Bran informs the Maester to tell Jon of the wall falling once he arrives and his sisters of the people in Wintertown being scared and Arya with some Northern soldiers escort everyone (including Old Lady Mel) to WF. 
-	Gendry soon arrives informing the Stark’s that J&amp;D have arrived at White Harbor, Arya and Gendry then have a proper more heartfelt reunion in the crypts and bond for alittle. After metting up with Tormund &amp; Beric on the road and learning of what happened, J&amp;D arrive to WF &amp; we get reunions galore (Jon &amp; Ghost, Sam, and Stark children, Sandor and Arya &amp; Sansa, and Tyrion and Sansa) and Northerners are not pleased to see Jon with Dany and her Dragons flying above. Jon sets up a meeting to discuss a plan against AOTD and to announce Dany as there queen. The Northerners give him smack for this and both Sansa &amp; even Arya (in a twist) are not pleased (but don’t worry both sisters (especially Arya) grow to like Dany). Meanwhile Cersei Miscarriages growing more mad &amp; Paranoid then ever.
-	Theon arrives at Pyke only to learn of Euron’s lie via Damphair whom is dies in his arms. Theon then sails off to try and track down Euron whom is getting the Golden Company from Essos after giving Yara the Forsakened treatment and Euron gets an idea. Bronn finds Jaime in the Crossroads Inn where he explains to him he is going on his own to assemble an army to take North and is offered to tag along, He does and they get an army made up of Remaining Frey Bannermen, 300 Sellswords from the Westerlands (thanks Bronn), and Edmure &amp; his remaining Bannermen (who escaped prisonment in between season). After wards they arrive to WF with not so warm welcomes (except for Brienne and Pod) but Jaime does apologize to Bran and Jon. Jon also gets revealed the truth via Bran and Sam, With a lot of mixed emotions he decides to tell the other Starks and Dany, But before Dany can even tell him she’s pregnant the horn goes off and it’s time for battle (also if your wondering Last hearth and Karhold was attack at this point).
-	The battle is brutal, resulting in the deaths of Ghost, Tormund, Grey Worm, Bronn, Yohn Royce, and most of the Northern Lords. Gendry also dies but is given the Kiss of Life by Beric. While that happens however Euron, Harry, and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame and sacking it for food, With Sansa &amp; Tyrion taken hostage &amp; Varys revealed to be a Traitor. NK arrives after Euron leaves and Mel uses her magic to hold off the NK for others to escape (even turning some dead against him) and barely escapes herself, Theon tracks down Euron’s ships only to be forced to kill a Tongueless Yara in her own Reek Persona, Mel meets up with him, explains who she is, and they sail off. J&amp;D &amp; co. have fallen back to the Riverlands where Dany finally reveals she is pregnant, They decide to marry with Jon not wanting his children to be Bastards also Bran &amp; Sam head to the God’s eye to figure out how to defeat NK once and for all and Jaime, Brienne, Gendry, Pod, and Sandor are send to KL to deal with Cersei, on there way there they run into Arya &amp; gendry who are headed there for the samething (they evacuated separate from everyone else).
-	In KL Euron returns with the Golden Company (though some died in surprise attack) and Tyrion &amp; Sansa are brought to Cersei, It is revealed Tyrion’s deal was that her child would live and be heir to the throne if J&amp;D win, but with the miscarriage she breaks the deal and his tongue is cut out. Jaime &amp; co. make it and Arya &amp; Gendry sneak in to Euron &amp; Cersei’s wedding (with Arya disguised in clothing similar to what Lyanna wore on her wedding day) to find out what has happened to Sansa &amp; Tyrion. The next day Jaime, Brienne, Pod, &amp; Sandor sneak in through the sewers while Gendry &amp; Arya get in through the front via Arya’s FM skills. Harry Strickland after talking with Sansa has a change of heart &amp; let’s Arya &amp; Gendry into the Red Keep, CLEGANEBOWL Sandor gets wounded badly in the fight but Arya &amp; Brienne step in &amp; finish off the Mountain as Sandor dies of his wounds. Arya almost kills Cersei but chooses family over vengeance &amp; goes to save Sansa &amp; Tyrion letting Jaime take the kill, As Harry sends some GC to Trident and kills Qyburn (Also Varys and Euron turn up missing).
-	Everyone leaves from Riverrun to the Trident where they meet up with Theon, Mel, and Tyrion &amp; the GC Harry send. As Dany goes into labour and survives giving birth to twins Jon meets with Bran &amp; Sam at the God’s Eye where Bran reveals Not only is Rhaegar Azor Ahai and Jon is Lightbringer, And that the NK is not the first WW (weather or not he is the 13th lord commander I have not decided yet) but also that the WW’s have return due to a mix of Resurgence in Magic, Wanting to end the curse the Children gave them, and being threatened by the burning of Weirwood. Bran explains what he must do and how to defeat him.
-	Everyone then heads to KL, By then the AOTD is not too far away, Jon and Dany fight the NK in the skies while Arya &amp; Gendry evacuate the city and Theon with his Ironborn and GC fight Euron and his Ironborn and remaining Pro-Euron GC. NK kills Dany and Drogon and Rhaegal dies killing Undead Viserion as Jon and NK land safely near the Dragonspit where they 1v1. Varys reappears and informs Jaime of the Wildfire under the Red Keep that will cause a chain reaction destroying the whole city. Jaime races to use it as a weapon on the Wights not before confessing his love to brienne. After everyone has evacuated Jaime sets it off killing him, Varys, the Little Birds, Sept Unella, Harry Strickland, Mel, and the Wights.
-	Bran &amp; Sam arrive in time for Bran to perform a Hold the Door 2.0 on the NK weakening him, Jon puts him down and with help from Sam removes the Dragonglass from his chest killing NK, Making remaining Wights collapse, and Turning the WW’s human. Afterwards everyone meets in the Dragonspit to decide what’s next. Jon is elected king and his first act is melting down the Iron Throne &amp; declaring there will no longer be one ruler but multiple rulers for each kingdom, Also a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established and Red Priest are banished from Westeros. Tyrion is given the Westerlands, Edmure gets back Riverlands, Robin keeps the Vale, Sansa gets the North, Sam and Gilly get the Reach, New houses get Pyke and the Stormlands, A Likeable Sand Snake gets Dorne, and Bran chooses to leave beyond the former wall with the now turned human WW’s. Arya along with Gendry and some Refugees sail more west (with Arya &amp; Gendry now being lovers), and Jon raises his children in KL as Ned did for him back in WF.
-	Oh and Sam write a Song of Ice and Fire. ALTERNATE ENDING: Arya and Gendry get the Crownlands and Jon decides to go back home in the North and raise his children there. Sansa kills Robin and assumes power in the vale.",gameofthrones,True,1532275183,2018-07-22

[SPOILERS] The Queen of Ashes Foreshadowing,"I have been re watching the show from season 1, making notes in every episode and paying attention every time they change from one scene to another and its just unbelievable how much foreshadowing there is about Daenerys burning down KL. I believe that both Cersei and Daenerys will destroy Kings Landing fighting for the Throne, but the show has been pointing out to Dany pretty much from season 1.


'



**S1E10** – The sorceress Mirri Maz Dull tells Daenerys she killed her son because [he would be the Stallion who Mounts the World, who would burn cities to the ground.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLpvLlrlFgc). The show is very precise about prophecies due the lack of time, they only show what is absolutely necessary. They left this prophecy because it will have relevance in the storyline. We now know that it was not Dany’s son, but Daenerys herself who would be The stallion who mounts. The prophecy says that the Stallion is the ""khal of khals"" who will unite all the Dothraki under his single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth. That’s what Daenerys did in season 6 and 7. If the prophecy its confirmed, she will be the one burning cities and trampling nations into dust.

'


&gt;Daenerys: My child was innocent.
&gt;Mirri: Innocent? He would be the Stalion who Mounts the World, now **he would burn no cities, now he will trample no nations into dust.**

'

**S1 E10**  - [Dany decides to kill Khal Drogo and burn his body next to her dragon eggs.]( https://youtu.be/wHJTYqLtRms) She lays next to him and promises to reunite with him one day ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east"". The next scene happens in Kings Landing Kings Landing with Maester Pyrcelle and Ross in his room; he is remembering the Mad King and what likeable and charming man he used to be in his youth, before madness took over him.

'

&gt;“Aerys Targaryen, of all the thousands and thousands maladies, the Gods visits us, madness is the worst. He was a good man, such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed with **dreams of Fire and Blood**”

'

The episode ends with Daenerys entering the fire pyre to eventually hatch the eggs and give birth to 3 dragons. She had this idea from a dragon dream in the early nights.


'


**S2 E4** – [Dany arrives in Qarth and they dont want to let her in]( https://youtu.be/In7YGhGt9Dw?t=3m9s), so she threatens to destroy the city once her dragons are bigger, thats the first time she threats to burn down a city and destroy completely. Daenerys is not mad or insane like her father. Her pride its her weakness, she is a very impulsive woman and when her pride is hurt she loses her head and makes drastic and terrible decisions. This wont be the last time Daenerys threatens to burn a city to the ground.


'


&gt;Daenerys: Thirteen, when my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me, and destroy those who wronged me, we will lay waste to armies, and burn cities to the ground. Turns us way, and I will burn you first!!!

&gt;Thirtenn: ahhhh, You ARE a Targaryen


'

**S2 E5** – Tyrion finds out all the [wildfire that its under Kings Landing]( https://youtu.be/YqMrgvy9uMA?t=2m), he mentions that its enough Wildfire to destroy all city. He tells the pyromancer: **“The contents of this room could lay Kings Landing low”.**The very next scene is Dany is Qarth, teaching Drogo to obey to her Dracarys order for the first time.


'


**S3 E4** –In this scene, Varys tries to [alert Lady Ollena of how dangerous Littlefinger is]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFZen-XO5II
). Pay attention at the words he uses to describe Littlefinger, those are the exact same words Tyrion used to describe Daenerys when he met her in Meeren.

'

&gt;Varys: **""Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.** He acquired the first two, how long before he has the army?"" Peharps you laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth.""Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.... he would see this country burn if he could be **King of the Ashes**

'

Varys was afraid that Littlefinger would destroy the realm trying to get the Iron Throne, so he decided to bring Daenerys to Westeros, ironically, she will be the one turning the kingdom into ashes. And here is something even better, this episode S3E4 ends with Daenerys literally acquiring her **first army**. [She sacks Astapor and leaves with the Unsulied, getting her first army in order to invade Westeros.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGRyZSMzRyo)


'

S3 E7 – In the Throne room Joffrey asks Tywin about Daenerys and wonders if they should do something about her. Tywin dismiss his concerns and tells him that **“Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threats to us.**  Westeros and the big players of the game continue to ignore Daenerys and her dragons, they are far more worried about their own selfish little games. Right after this scene, we cut to Essos where Dany is planning the invasion of Yunkai. This will be the second city she conquers. 


'

S5E10- Right after the scene where Stannis burns down Sheereen at the stake as a sacrifice for the Lord of Light, they cut to the scene in Meereen where Daenerys and Hizdahr are presenting to the reopening of the Fighting Pits. During their conversation Daenerys explain that sometimes there may be a good reason to burn a city to the ground.


&gt;Hizdahr - That is a vital part of the Great City of Meereen, which existed long before you and I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.

&gt;Daenerys - One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.

&gt;Hizdahr - At your command?

&gt;Daenerys - If need to be.

&gt;Hizdahr - And how many will die to make their happen?

&gt;Daenerys - If it comes to that, they will have died for a good reason.

&gt;Hizdahr - Those men (in the fighting pit) think they are dying for a good reason.

&gt;Daenerys - Someone else reason.

&gt;Hizdahr - So your reasons are true and theirs are false? They don’t know their own minds, but you do?


'

This dialogue is a very important moment for Daenerys as a character. She is starting to rationale the idea of burning cities to the ground in order to achieve an objective, as something necessary, while not realizing that she is losing her humanity, just like those men who are fighting in the pits. She is using excuses of a greater cause to justify the deaths of millions. Just like Stannis did when he burned down Sheeren.


'

S6 E6 - Bran Stark has a new series of visions and one of the visions include a dragon flying over Kings Landing. In the DVD comentary the producers D&amp;D made sure to observe that the image of the dragon flying over Kings Landing it was one the most important image of the whole show.


'


S6 E8 – Cersei shows up at the Throne room for a Royal announcement, Tommen declares Trial by combat forbidden in all 7 Kingdoms. [Cersei then asks Qyburn about the rumor of wildfire under the city]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmqQo37R3As), he confirms that the rumors are true and is much bigger than they expected to be. 

'

&gt;Qyburn: “Your grace, that old rumor you told me about it. My little birds investigated.

&gt;Cersei: And? Its just a rumor or something more?

&gt;Qyburn? More, so much more….


'

The very next scene? Meeren being attacked by the rival cities of Slavery Bay. Missandei tells Tyrion: “The Masters have come to collect their properties”. That’s how Daenerys sees Westeros, something that belongs to her and that she needs to retake it.


'


**S6E9**- Daenerys returns to Meereen and finds the city is being attacked by the Masters of the rival cities. She then tells Tyion about her plans against the attack. 

'

&gt;Daenerys: “I will crucify the masters. I will set their fleets on fire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their city to the dirt.”

'

Daenerys was contemplating the idea of burning a city to the ground in the past season, now she wants to actually do it, but is stopped by Tyrion who presents her with another idea. That’s the second time now that  Daenerys threatens to burn down a city and turn into ashes. 

'


**S6E10** – The scene where [Jon Snow is crowned KITN, Lord Cerweyn tells the room that they need to go home.]( https://youtu.be/AXAnxAA73xM?t=37s) 


&gt;The Boltons are defeated, the war is over, winter has come, if the measters are right it will be the coldest one in a thousands years, we should ride home and wait for the coming storms.

&gt;Jon Snow: The war is not over, and I promise you friend, **the true enemy wont wait out the storm, he brings the storm.** 

Remember, Daenerys nickname is Stormborn. She was always a threath to Westeros, but we were so distarcted by the Night King and the Armt of the Dead that we dodnt realize how dangerous she could be for 
the whole realm. 


'


I now believe that both dragons and the army of the dead will destroy the kingdom, but George used the White Walkers as a redherring for the dragons and the way George did was kind of brilliant. The very first scene of the book and tv show, its the rangers going North of the wall and finding the White Walkers and we were all so scared and terrified of them. Then the last scene of the book 1 and season 1 its the birth of the dragons and we all celebrated!!! We were soo happy and excited, and we didn’t realize that dragons were as dangerous for Westeros as the White Walkers. 


George RRM called [Daenerys and the Army of the Dead, much bigger threats that could destory the kingdom]( http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/talk-to-al-jazeera/articles/2014/11/13/george-rr-martintalkstodavidshuster.html), but people were so worried about the selfish politics in Kings Landing that they ignore the danger. 

'


&gt;George RRM - Well, of course, the two outlying ones — **the things going on north of the Wall, and then there is a Targaryen on the other continent with her dragons — are of course the ice and fire of the title**, “A Song of Ice and Fire.” …You know, one of the dynamics I started with, there was the sense of people being so consumed by their petty struggles for power within the seven kingdoms, within King’s Landing — who’s going to be king? Who’s going to be on the Small Council? Who’s going to determine the policies? — **that they’re blind to the much greater and more dangerous threats that are happening far away on the periphery of their kingdoms.**

[Spoilers] How it all could end.,"I was rewatching the first season, and caught an interesting scene that I’m not sure has been discussed here before.

The scene is Jon saying goodbye to Bran while Bran is still in his coma.  Jon references the fact that he and Bran had always planned to go to the wall together, and that they still will someday. They can even go beyond the wall together, if Bran isn’t too afraid.

Could the secret to defeating the NK lie beyond the wall, only to be discovered by Bran in a vision?  I for one would love to see Jon and Bran go beyond the wall together, perhaps to strip the NK of his source of power.

Just a thought.

[SPOILERS] Interesting Theory About Season 8,"It is known that weirwood trees are vast in the north and that there are significantly less in the south. I believe in season three (or could be two), Osha says to Bran while he is praying for Robb that Robb won’t hear his prayers the further south he goes during the war of the five kings since there are hardly any weirwood trees in the south, saying something along the lines of “they have no power there.” 

Following that same thought process, as the white walker army travels further south to King's Landing (presumably), could the Night King’s power dwindle somewhat as well? 

I don’t think it would have a drastic impact on his power by any means but would love to hear everyone’s thoughts.

[SPOILERS] Valyrian steel dagger and Aegon Targaryen,"I know there’s a lot of subreddits mentioning the dagger and Aegon Targaryen. But having read a lot of them  I have some unanswered doubts.

1. It strikes me as a huge coincidence that when the Targaryens flew from Old Valyria and conquered the seven kingdoms (riding 3 dragons), Aegon was the conqueror and now, Daenerys has 3 dragons (2 after the Night King killed one) with Aegon Targaryen (Jon’s real name) by her side.

2. Also it’s a huge coincidence that when Samwell Tarly is transcribing old texts in Oldtown, he lingers in a page where we see the dagger that Littlefinger gave the catspaw to murder Bran; that page stated that the Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons (one can only asume that the dagger was Aegon’s).

3. The white walkers were “asleep” for a thousand years waiting to conquer Westeros again.

It seems a bit cyclical from the time the Targaryens with Aegon leading them conquered Westeros and the current TV show timeline.

I think the dagger is more of a “remember Littlefinger’s treason”, because if it belonged to Aegon Targaryen, now there’s another Aegon Targaryen and the dagger reappeared (now in Arya’s belt).

Could it be possible that the dagger holds a special significance throughout the story of the seven kingdoms and will be used to kill the Night King?

[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones - a critique,"I am quite happy to claim that Game of Thrones is one of the best TV shows ever made, its production, themes, acting and story are all of the highest order but I don’t think I’ll get too many disagreements when I say the quality dropped off dramatically in season 5 and, whilst it has picked up again since, season 7, and presumably the final season, are very different in style to the first few. This post is my attempt to quantify why the show dropped in quality and what has changed.

There are three primary storylines in GoT, the power struggle in King’s Landing, the approach of the White Walkers in the North and the rise of Dany in the East, each of these stories start independently before coming together in the final act. The problem the showrunners had is they struggled to make each story consistently compelling over the first six seasons. 

The weakest of the three stories was Dany’s, in the first season it was excellent, Dany’s transition from victim to regal queen was astonishing but the showrunners found it impossible to maintain that momentum over the following 5 seasons. They knew that at some point Dany would have to sail to Westeros at the head of an army but they struggled to make her journey towards that point compelling. In the end we had to contend with a bland ‘success followed by set back’ arc that robbed her ambition to retake the Iron Throne of any urgency.

Much better was the story in the North. Jon’s rise from ranger to leading the resistance against the White Walkers was nuanced and well paced featuring a rich supporting cast to help or hinder him. But it wasn’t this that made the show great,  Jon’s story was the most traditional of the three, a young hero has to overcome adversity to save the world from a terrifying enemy, it’s a  classic ‘hero’s journey’ that’s been told thousands of times and, no matter how well GoT did it, it could never truly stand out.

What made GoT special was the power struggle in King’s Landing. From the moment Robert Baratheon died the show went into overdrive, the vacuum that emerged that various parties tried to fill, the war that was told in terms of strategy rather than combat, the court intrigue and manoeuvring, it was superb.  At the heart of all this was Tywin Lannister, the man pulling the strings and holding all the cards. This storyline was all about the battle for the crown, the early seasons focussed on the War of the Five Kings ending with Joffrey as the last man standing. Season 4 maintained the intrigue by murdering Joffrey and dealing with the fall out. It’s notable that this part of the story was book ended by a very specific event, the death of Tywin Lannister.

With Tywin gone seasons 5 and 6 where supposed to be about the battle to replace him as the true power behind the throne.  It was an interesting idea with Margery Tyrell, Cersai and the High Sparrow all manoeuvring to dominate King Tommen but the showrunners failed to make it as exciting or surprising  as the earlier seasons. We never really understood what each parties’ ambitions were and what where the stakes. In the end the matter was settled by a big reset button of an explosion which made the events of the previous two seasons largely meaningless, it was an unsatisfactory ending to an unsatisfactory storyline.

The result of this was that seasons 5 and 6 were a big disappointment, King’s landing was flat, we were still waiting for Dany to do anything interesting and the story in the North wasn’t enough to maintain the show by itself.

Season 7 picked up the pace again but now the show was very different, we were finally in the end game. Dany was back on Westeros fighting Cersai and Jon Snow was trying to rally them to put aside their differences and unite against the White Walkers. What we had was a very different story to the one that worked so well in the early seasons. Gone was the intrigue, manoeuvring and battle of wits, it was replaced by an epic fantasy story similar in style and scope to Lord of the Rings. This is not a terrible outcome, GoT is still the most incredible thing we’ve seen on TV but now it’s epic for its scope rather then the brilliance of the story.  

I’m still hoping that GoT can surprise and delight me in the way it did in the early seasons but I’m not expecting it to. I’m expecting an epic conclusion where villains are defeated and heroes save the day, all framed by the most incredible battle scenes ever shown on TV. That ending won’t be bad, I’ll still love it and I’m sure there will be a twist or two yet to come but it will lack the complexity and blurred lines of the first seasons, it will fall short of the expectations I had for the show when Tyrion shot Tywin as he sat on the privy.

[SPOILERS] My Late Final Season predictions,"Okay so these are my final full predictions for S8, these are the predictions I am sticking with until I am proven wrong with the first trailer, Now before you start you are probably wondering (for anyone who read the other post anyways) “didn’t you post your predictions a few days ago?” yes I did, but those are more of highlights these are my full predictions. Which is why I will not be deleting them either (as they are similar minus two changes). Either way I will leave a link to them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8zx28z/spoilers_my_theoriespredictions_for_season_8/
Now let’s begin, my predictions are made up of my own ideas, the small amount of filming info I read, and one Leak that may not even be true:

-	After racing to Castle Black to inform Edd of Eastwatch Destruction, Tormund and Beric race on horse pack to WF to warn the Starks (and Jon once he arrives) as Edd chooses to stay and Defend the wall, him &amp; the rest of NW dies either marching too Eastwatch and trying to hold off the NK’s forces or NK brings down the rest of the Wall. Meanwhile in Wintertown the citizens are in fear after feeling the ground shake knowing what it means, Bran informs the Maester to tell Jon of the wall falling once he arrives and his sisters of the people in Wintertown being scared and Arya with some Northern soldiers escort everyone (including Old Lady Mel) to WF. 
-	Gendry soon arrives informing the Stark’s that J&amp;D have arrived at White Harbor, Arya and Gendry then have a proper more heartfelt reunion in the crypts and bond for alittle. After metting up with Tormund &amp; Beric on the road and learning of what happened, J&amp;D arrive to WF &amp; we get reunions galore (Jon &amp; Ghost, Sam, and Stark children, Sandor and Arya &amp; Sansa, and Tyrion and Sansa) and Northerners are not pleased to see Jon with Dany and her Dragons flying above. Jon sets up a meeting to discuss a plan against AOTD and to announce Dany as there queen. The Northerners give him smack for this and both Sansa &amp; even Arya (in a twist) are not pleased (but don’t worry both sisters (especially Arya) grow to like Dany). Meanwhile Cersei Miscarriages growing more mad &amp; Paranoid then ever.
-	Theon arrives at Pyke only to learn of Euron’s lie via Damphair whom is dies in his arms. Theon then sails off to try and track down Euron whom is getting the Golden Company from Essos after giving Yara the Forsakened treatment and Euron gets an idea. Bronn finds Jaime in the Crossroads Inn where he explains to him he is going on his own to assemble an army to take North and is offered to tag along, He does and they get an army made up of Remaining Frey Bannermen, 300 Sellswords from the Westerlands (thanks Bronn), and Edmure &amp; his remaining Bannermen (who escaped prisonment in between season). After wards they arrive to WF with not so warm welcomes (except for Brienne and Pod) but Jaime does apologize to Bran and Jon. Jon also gets revealed the truth via Bran and Sam, With a lot of mixed emotions he decides to tell the other Starks and Dany, But before Dany can even tell him she’s pregnant the horn goes off and it’s time for battle (also if your wondering Last hearth and Karhold was attack at this point).
-	The battle is brutal, resulting in the deaths of Ghost, Tormund, Grey Worm, Bronn, Yohn Royce, and most of the Northern Lords. Gendry also dies but is given the Kiss of Life by Beric. While that happens however Euron, Harry, and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame and sacking it for food, With Sansa &amp; Tyrion taken hostage &amp; Varys revealed to be a Traitor. NK arrives after Euron leaves and Mel uses her magic to hold off the NK for others to escape (even turning some dead against him) and barely escapes herself, Theon tracks down Euron’s ships only to be forced to kill a Tongueless Yara in her own Reek Persona, Mel meets up with him, explains who she is, and they sail off. J&amp;D &amp; co. have fallen back to the Riverlands where Dany finally reveals she is pregnant, They decide to marry with Jon not wanting his children to be Bastards also Bran &amp; Sam head to the God’s eye to figure out how to defeat NK once and for all and Jaime, Brienne, Gendry, Pod, and Sandor are send to KL to deal with Cersei, on there way there they run into Arya &amp; gendry who are headed there for the samething (they evacuated separate from everyone else).
-	In KL Euron returns with the Golden Company (though some died in surprise attack) and Tyrion &amp; Sansa are brought to Cersei, It is revealed Tyrion’s deal was that her child would live and be heir to the throne if J&amp;D win, but with the miscarriage she breaks the deal and his tongue is cut out. Jaime &amp; co. make it and Arya &amp; Gendry sneak in to Euron &amp; Cersei’s wedding (with Arya disguised in clothing similar to what Lyanna wore on her wedding day) to find out what has happened to Sansa &amp; Tyrion. The next day Jaime, Brienne, Pod, &amp; Sandor sneak in through the sewers while Gendry &amp; Arya get in through the front via Arya’s FM skills. Harry Strickland after talking with Sansa has a change of heart &amp; let’s Arya &amp; Gendry into the Red Keep, CLEGANEBOWL Sandor gets wounded badly in the fight but Arya &amp; Brienne step in &amp; finish off the Mountain as Sandor dies of his wounds. Arya almost kills Cersei but chooses family over vengeance &amp; goes to save Sansa &amp; Tyrion letting Jaime take the kill, As Harry sends some GC to Trident and kills Qyburn (Also Varys and Euron turn up missing).
-	Everyone leaves from Riverrun to the Trident where they meet up with Theon, Mel, and Tyrion &amp; the GC Harry send. As Dany goes into labour and survives giving birth to twins Jon meets with Bran &amp; Sam at the God’s Eye where Bran reveals Not only is Rhaegar Azor Ahai and Jon is Lightbringer, And that the NK is not the first WW (weather or not he is the 13th lord commander I have not decided yet) but also that the WW’s have return due to a mix of Resurgence in Magic, Wanting to end the curse the Children gave them, and being threatened by the burning of Weirwood. Bran explains what he must do and how to defeat him.
-	Everyone then heads to KL, By then the AOTD is not too far away, Jon and Dany fight the NK in the skies while Arya &amp; Gendry evacuate the city and Theon with his Ironborn and GC fight Euron and his Ironborn and remaining Pro-Euron GC. NK kills Dany and Drogon and Rhaegal dies killing Undead Viserion as Jon and NK land safely near the Dragonspit where they 1v1. Varys reappears and informs Jaime of the Wildfire under the Red Keep that will cause a chain reaction destroying the whole city. Jaime races to use it as a weapon on the Wights not before confessing his love to brienne. After everyone has evacuated Jaime sets it off killing him, Varys, the Little Birds, Sept Unella, Harry Strickland, Mel, and the Wights.
-	Bran &amp; Sam arrive in time for Bran to perform a Hold the Door 2.0 on the NK weakening him, Jon puts him down and with help from Sam removes the Dragonglass from his chest killing NK, Making remaining Wights collapse, and Turning the WW’s human. Afterwards everyone meets in the Dragonspit to decide what’s next. Jon is elected king and his first act is melting down the Iron Throne &amp; declaring there will no longer be one ruler but multiple rulers for each kingdom, Also a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established and Red Priest are banished from Westeros. Tyrion is given the Westerlands, Edmure gets back Riverlands, Robin keeps the Vale, Sansa gets the North, Sam and Gilly get the Reach, New houses get Pyke and the Stormlands, A Likeable Sand Snake gets Dorne, and Bran chooses to leave beyond the former wall with the now turned human WW’s. Arya along with Gendry and some Refugees sail more west (with Arya &amp; Gendry now being lovers), and Jon raises his children in KL as Ned did for him back in WF.
-	Oh and Sam write a Song of Ice and Fire. ALTERNATE ENDING: Arya and Gendry get the Crownlands and Jon decides to go back home in the North and raise his children there. Sansa kills Robin and assumes power in the vale.",gameofthrones,True,1532365297,2018-07-23

Watching him humiliate Tyrion, I was thinking ‘oh I will enjoy seeing him dead.. maybe in Season 5 or 6‘ but Boom  it happened when I least expected it.

But what‘s also great about this shock is that it provokes a neo noir narration, because it‘s still unknown who really poisoned Joffrey. 
Other than that, I feel like nearly every plot and storyline is reaching it‘s high point to date. I‘m really enjoying the Arya/Clegane relationship, and Stannis and The Red Queen are more complex than ever. And in Episode 3 we got Daario Naharis get into complete beast mode.

Game of Thrones (Cons):
* There's only one season out and it looks like it'll stay that way
* I already have a basic knowledge of most of the important bits
* Played episode one years ago, wanted more but not enough to buy the episodes at full price

Batman (Pros):
* It's the goddamn Batman
* Has about 8 - 10 hours of game play for season one
* Has two full five-episode seasons out right now
* Have next to no knowledge of the story

Batman (Cons):
* $10 for season one

* If it's good, I'd have to spend another $14 for season two

[SPOILERS] Anyone else somewhat bothered by how the scale of the battles has been represented?,"I just want to preface this with how much I love GoT and understand that TV budget is different than movies (even though the GoT per episode budget is crazy high) but even the best shows have little things you can nitpick. 

 In the first season or two you hear much talk about how Stannis and his brother Renly have these massive armies up to about 100,000 each. After Stannis kills Renly it is implied that most of his men will then pledge allegiance to Stannis. So at this point we are looking at an army with 150,000+ right? The wildfire explosion looked like it took out 5+ of his ships at most which is absolutely nothing in the grand scheme. When they finally dock and are literally right outside the gates of kings landing it looks like Stannis has maximum a couple thousand soldiers if that. I just never have felt that they convey the gravity of the situation when it actually comes time for battle. This seems to be the theme throughout most of the show how they talk up these huge armies but when they actually show them it doesn't even look like it could be more than 5000 people. Maybe it's just me that is bothered by this sort of thing but when I think of 100,000 people coming to battle I think of something like the battle of Pelennor fields. Sorry for this stupid little rant this is my second time binging GoT I am sure it is more CGI price related than anything.

"If you were the director, what location and how would you show a battle with the Others? [Spoilers]","I'm not too picky but if I had any creative control I would want a cold open, and show smaller skrimishes in the North all taking what looks like heavy losses. One of the men who survives tells a Maester something about hoping Jon is ready in the Neck because the hoards of Others are filtering South and the plan is working. Sadly Jon has taken men to the only place were ravens can't deliver messages... the disappearing villages of Greywater Watch. (Then the opening song starts) 

This is one of the most mysterious locations in Westeros so I feel like it would be really interesting to finally see it... Not to mention showing off the guerrilla warfare tactics of the Crannogmen and meeting Howland Reed.

Since everything in Westeros would be ice and snow, I'd have the bogs of Greywater Watch gurgling and steaming just as a plot device to show why they aren't fully frozen. When the Others arrive with a swirling snow storm, there will be a thick blanket of fog hiding the mud pits. The Crannogmen will appear like ghosts out from behind the tall grass and reeds with their frog spears tipped with Dragon Glass and when it starts looking desperate, we find out everything is completely booby-trapped and the Crannogmen are just taunting the White Walkers forward into the bogs. 

The Neck is supposed to full of sink holes, and quick sand and the Crannogmen are supposed to be extremely crafty. They don't really fight as much as they trick enemies into getting stuck and then retreating further into the marshes. Obviously the battle wouldn't be won then and there, but it would be a good way to take out a large number of Others without lots of casualties. 

By now Jon would know about his parents either from Sam or Bran, but he never got that final conversation with Ned about his mother. Howland could answers some of Jon's questions and bring closure to all the doubts he will probably be having about himself.

[SPOILERS] How should Season 8 begin,"So we all are predicting on how Season 8 is going to end, but I wanted to ask this question, how do we think Season 8 will begin? Personally I think it will begin with a small family going into Wintertown to try and get food from the market for winter.

[Spoilers] Was Cersei intentionally trying to bring ruin to House Lannister?,"Show spoilers below.

She has basically destroyed House Lannister single handed. She put Joffrey on the throne, screwed over Tyrion to the point the events with him being tossed in the dungeons leads to what happens to the head of the House (Tywin). Looking back, pretty much everything that has destroyed this House comes back to Cersei.

I briefly thought she just wanted to be queen, but quickly realized that wasn’t the case, because many of the terrible choices she was making happened well before her being queen seemed at all plausible (she clearly didn’t intend to have what happened to Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella happen), she didn’t expect Tyrion to survive the dungeons, and it just doesn’t make sense she would destroy her own House, the sept (which means a fair deal to quite a few people), and completely destroy another House (Tyrell) which were allies to her own (nobody is going to trust her or make an alliance with her after that). After destroying House Lannister, she doesn’t seem to have anyone that would truly be loyal, and back her. Even if she found an ally, they would only back her out of fear, and they would almost certainly abandon her the moment any other suitable choice presents itself. The list of “ridiculously asinine things Cersei does” goes on and on.

I understand making mistakes, but almost every single thing she does seems to be a mistake, to the point it seems intentional. Do you think she wanted to destroy House Lannister, or do you think she just had no idea what she’s doing? If you think it was intentional, why?",gameofthrones,True,1532443942,2018-07-24

[Spoilers] A season 8 outline. (No Dialogue). Episode 1,"The opening shot of season 8 is Bran awakening similarly to how Jon awoke when he was revived.
We go to Melissandre and the Lord of the Light gang in Volantis, she convinces them to join her in the fight against the dead, they sail to Westeroes. (I am unsure whether Kinvara will return).
We now go to King's Landing, Cersei does have her miscarriage, she starts to get emotional but dosen't show it similar to how she reacted to Tommen's death, this is the moment when she decends into complete madness.
We see Jaime Lanninster on his travel to Winterfell, he is accompanied by Bronn, they stop for a while and talk, soon they continue their travels.
We see Euron Grejoy arriving in Essos to collect the Golden Company, he and Harry personalities clash, but the GC agree to help him and Cersei in the war's to come.
We do not see any of the boat travel to White Harbour, we see Jon, Dany and the rest of the crew looking at Winterfell from the stop Arya was.
In the final scene of the episode The NK and the Army of the Dead arrive at either Karhold or the Last Hearth, dosen't particularly matter because they will suffer the same faith, as the families of the castles are prepared to travel to Winterfell, they hear a dragon roar, we look we see the Night King on Viserion, he completely obliterated the castle, we see sir Edd Williams and members of the Night's Watch in the AOtD. We also see Alice Karstark or young Umber awake with blue eyes.

[SPOILERS] WHY BARATHEON SIGIL STILL OVER KINGS LANDING?,"hi folks, one strange thing I have noticed is baratheon sigil still is shown over kings landing in the opening credits.

take a look

[Baratheon sigil over kingslanding](https://i.redd.it/zzkw3sn2axb11.jpg)

in her coronation scene, qyburn proclaimed her as ***""cersei of house lannister"".***

also, cersei had replaced all the stag sigils in kingslanding with lion sigils.

its evident in season 7, everywhere in castle of KL, we see lion sigils. Also, the baratheon sigil in the throne room has been replaced. so by all means, she has established her tyranny in the name of house lannister.

remember the showrunners replaced the bolton sigil  with stark wolf after the battle of bastards in episode ten within season 6.

but why does they still keep showing the baratheon sigil above KL?

they had an entire season to edit and make changes. so by no way, it was a mistake. by the start of season 7, cersei had established her tyranny in the name of house lannister. so why did they still insist of keeping the stag sigil above KL? all through season 7?

remember that officially house baratheon is extinct with the death of tommen( and to some extent with the death of stannis) and the one remaining member is gendry, an unknown bastard whose heritage is not even recognised by the public.

so my instinct tells me that they are doing it on purpose. there's a hidden reason why they are still insisting on putting the stag sigil of an ""extinct"" house baratheon over KL. probably it would be revealed in season 8.

some speculations  include that somehow gendry would end up on the iron throne.

others say that gendry was never a bastard, but he is actually the trueborn son of robert and cersei all this time, hence the showrunners insist on showing the ""extinct"" house baratheon sigil on KL. 

i am not sure, gendry being son of robert and cersei sounds like a logical explanation why they still show the stag sigil over KL, like a foreshadowing.

watch out for surprises in season 8.

as it turns out, most actors and actresses in interviews are saying that ending of season 8 would turn out to be *""an unpredictable ending"".*

guess ""unpredictable"" is becoming the new ""bittersweet"".

or will it be an ""unpredictably bittersweet ending?""

Jon gets sight of Arya and Bran, but dosen't get a chance to properly reunite because their called into the grand hall of Winterfell. Immediately Jon is welcomed back, and tell's his followers in Winterfell about what happened inculding the events of Beyond The Wall.     
Sansa gives Daenarys dirty looks as do the Northerns. They say they are obligated to Jon Snow, and refuse to fight for Dany, she gives a speech but received little to no sympathy. Jon also gives a speech, the Northerns Reluctantly decided to fight with Daenarys. 
We see sir Jaime and Bronn travelling, they arrive at the Twins to see if any fighting men are left, but there are only women. They continue their trip North.
The Golden Company have arrived in King's Landing alongside Euron. 
In the Throne Room peasants have arrived pleading their case to Cersei, Cersei treats them with no sympathy and has ser Gregor kill them, Euron and Harry Skrictland walk in moments after and Cersei greets them. Cersei says she is happy to have the Golden Company on herside, she decides to send them North to lanuch a sneak attack on Winterfell. 
Theon and his force arrive at the Iron Islands, they expect Euron to be here with Yara, but they are disappointed to find nothing but a few fishermen, they say Euron has not been back to the Iron Islands, he has fooled Theon.
Jon eventully reunites with Sansa. And then Arya, their reunion is emotional, they trade stories and Jon points out Arya still has Needle. Jon moves onto to reunite with Bran, Jon is let down as he notices Bran has changed since he became the The Three Eyed Raven, Sam is also with Bran and reunites with Jon. Bran decided not to tell anyone about the wall falling and Viserion, but he tells Jon, Jon is very concerned. Bran is about to tell Jon about the truth about Rhaeghar and Lyanna but there is a knock on the door, Jon is needed by Daenarys. Daenerys expresses her concerns about not being liked by the Northerns. She tells Jon about the pregnancy, Jon is shocked and excited at the same time.
The final scene of this episode is the Night King attacking either Karhold or The Last Hearth, i don't know which he will attack first, but what happens is the same as my first episode, the castle people prepare to leave, they heard the sound of Viserion in the distance, they barely have a chance to look up before Viserion breathes his fire and obliterates them. Surprisingly we see Hodor march with the army of the dead alongside members of the Night's Watch. the final shot we see Alice Karstark/ Ned Umber's eyes turn blue as the camera fades.

[SPOILERS] What are your 3 most upsetting moments in the entire series?,"

My three in order are 

3. Death of Hodor

2. Arya leaving the Hound to die 

1. The sacrifice of Shireen Baratheon 

Poor Hodor. Loyally served and protected Bran and his friends for nearly the entire series, even on a practical suicide mission beyond the wall, before sacrificing himself to ensure their safety. Didn’t deserve such a horrible death at the hands of the wights. 

Hated watching Arya and the Hound separate as they were my absolute favourite story arc. Very powerful and heart wrenching scene between them as it had become clear they now cared quite a bit about each other, with the Hound stating he was watching over her and protecting her, and Arya being unable to bring herself to kill him despite his goading to put him out of his misery. I was relieved to have him return as he is without a doubt my favourite character. 

Shireen’s death though, is just outright disturbing, I found it very difficult to watch the first time through. The ear-piercing screams are too much. Especially since I thought she was a very kind and helpful to those around her, not to mention being just a child. Her relationship with Davos is great, so it’s heartbreaking to see how much it affected him. ",gameofthrones,True,1532466132,2018-07-24

Jon and his colleagues are surrounded by wights similar to how the Bolton's surrounds them, as the wights prepare to attack Lady Melissandre steps into the frey, Melissandre has her hands on fire and steps and clears the horde. There is now a clear path to the Night King, the Night King knows Jon is the one who needs to kill him so he allows him through, If Jon defeats the Night King he will defeat the AOTD, if the Night King wins the dead will overwhelm the rest of the North and South. Jon has a stare-down with the Night King almost as-long as the Hard Home stare-down, the Night King is using his infamous Spear as his weapon and Jon is using LongClaw. The Battle Begins. At first, it is an even battle, eventually the Night King starts to gain control and stabs Jon in the leg, this isn't enough to keep Jon down. As the battle is going on we go into Bran's vison, we find out that the Night King must be killed with a flaming sword, a valyrian steel sword or dragonglass weapon will not kill him, unless it is flamed, Jon begins to gain the momentum, after about 15 exchanges The Night King uses his supernatural strength to push Jon backwards, Jon is hurt but must continue fighting, Jon returns to the battle, there is no clear domiant weapon so Jon starts to use his fists to keep the Night King away, but the Night King reacts first and hits Jon with a fist to the face, Jon is laying on the ground almost unconscious as the Night King goes to finish Jon he sticks his sword up in defence his sword turn to fire, The Night King cannot penetrate enough strength to break through the sword, Jon pulls a dragonglass dagger out of his pocket and stabs the Nk, this dosen't kill the Night King but it is slowly starting to damage him more and more. Jon is strong enough to knock down the Night King's weapon and has one last look at the Night King before he is shattered to ice. Suddenly every wight and White Walker shatters completely, as the Night King is responsible for turning all of them.
The episodes ends with Jon returning to the caste, and kissing Dany, At this moment there are several reunions, Jaime and Brienne, Jaime and Tyrion, Melissandre and Davos even get on. The camera zooms away from Winterfell as the aftermath is shown.

[spoilers] s4 - S7 spoilers something I think will happen in season 8.,"My reason for thinking this is because I think it could make a good story. No leaks, just me shooting the shit. 

I think that cercie will find a way to get one of those dragons. It'll make Snow and Emilia's life more difficult. It'll make it 3v3 instead of 1 v (2 v 2). I feel like it'll almost be poetically brilliant.

"[SPOILERS] In my opinion, Season 4 of Games of Thrones is the single greatest achievement in television history.","YES. I finally finished watching Season 4 of Game of Thrones.

This have been 10 hours of pure joy, and arguably the most invested I ever was in a TV show. Why is Season 4 my favorite Season to date?  
Simple. Because it has everything I dreamed it would have. There was no filler. Every episode delivered and that is ultimately what I found so great. For me ""The Lion and The Rose"" is ""Rains of Castamere"" level. The pure level of joy I had with Joeffrey the son of a bitch dying is inexplicable. It happened when it needed to happen, and it was perfect.   
What's even better is that I never found any plot elements to be boring. Normally I never cared about the Goldie/Sam angle, but I actually found it quite okay here. Arya/Clengan angle was very interesting, as is Baelish/Sansa, a relationship I really want to see. Tyrion's monologue at the end of ""The Laws of Gods and Men"" is one of the most powerful scenes in the whole show. I loved the direction they went with Jaime, he actually became one of my favorite characters, although he was one of my most hated in Season One. Dario Naharis is a great addition for Daenerys, of which I really hope gets bit more straightforward in the next season (I really want to see some battles with Dragons), but really. t the end of the day the clear show stealer was Jon Snow, who became my favorite character (even out trumping Tyrion).

  
And then it happened, my favorite GoT episode to date: The Watchers on The Wall. For the most part I never really cared about the conflict with the people in North, but this wasn't only storytelling at its finest with many interesting plot points/elements, but also one of the best battle scenes I have ever seen. It may not completely compare with The Battle of Helm's Deep, but it's damn near close. The pure amount of innovation is astonishing. And there were fucking Giants! On a fucking Mammoth!! I have never been more invested in a Television episode (well maybe at Hannibal Season 2 Episode 13).

I really have nothing to complain about. Yes, maybe Daenerys character arch isn't as interesting until now, and I really want to see more of the White Walkers, but these are minor complaints. Everything works. Every actor delivers. Every character shines. Every plot point is straight forward. Every hint is brilliant. Every episode is worth rewatching. I have never given a TV season the full 10/10, but if there's one Season deemed perfect, it's this one.

[SPOILERS],"Just read the whole plot leak of Season 8. It may or may not be real but the plot leak for season 7 (coming from the same source) was accurate. I have to admit I do regret reading it (thinking it was another entertaining phony plot leak) and I came here to discuss about it. I linked the video below but here are a few key pointers.
- Cersei plans to use wildfire and kill dany but Jamie (who has been taken captive) strangles her to death when they meet in his cell. (Episode 4)
- euron becomes king but eventually flees with captive jamie when dany flies over to burn kings landing when she finds out euron executed jorah, theon and yara
- Bran is the night king. He tried to go back in time to stop the creation of the night king and warged into a man to tell to stop the children of the forest. Turns out the man he warged into was the about-to-be first white walker and the night king. He eventually gets turned into the night king and irl bran gets stuck in vision mode (with the white eyes).
- John kills bran to kill the night king
- dany dies giving birth to their daughter Lyanna
- John rules but spreads the west into independant kingdoms
- euron and jamie who has escaped are “presumably dead” but could be the start of a spinoff series
- key people who didnt die include sansa arya jon tyrion brienne
I really dont know what to make of this but I hope it isnt true because that would mean Id have to watch season 8 knowing whats gonna happen.

They can't pass through the wall, so long as it stands (and it should still be standing, if the characters had held to this knowledge) . If Jon &amp; Co. hadn't gone beyond the wall, and Dany hadn't shown up with her dragons, the Walkers wouldn't have had any opportunity to pass through.

Other fun ones are Tully from anglicized irish meaning 'descendant of Taithleach'; entailing traits like 'calm' 

Tyrell is derived from french *tirer* and apparently meant stubborn

Martell comes from latin ""Martellus"", or hammer. So basically a smith name.

Frey comes from middle german ""vri"" (free)

Stark means what it sounds like.

[SPOILERS] How will the series end,"So with season 8 coming soon (I would say not too far away but we know that's not true at all) it's time to discuss how will the series end, and I would very much like to hear your theories as well.

So anyways I believe at some point Jon will meet Bran &amp; Sam at the God's eye where Bean reveals not only is Jon's father Rhaegar TPTWP (with Jon being lightbringer), but also he reveals the WW's have returned due to a combination of resurgence in magic, Jon's birth, wanting to end the curse the children put on them all those years ago, and them being threatened by the burning of Weirwood's.

Sam also tells Jon he has to accept you he is, Jon decides he is a Stark AND a Targaryen and flies off on Rhaegal to KL. Everyone is at KL (Cersei is already taken care of by this point) and the wights are near KL. Jon and Dany are fighting NK in the sky, NK and Viserion kill Dany and Drogon and Rhaegal dies killing Viserion. They land at either the Dragonspits or the God's Eye and 1v1 there. Bran then weakens the NK via warging him or winning in a battle of minds or doing a hold the door 2.0 on him. Either way he is weakened long enough for Jon to remove the Dragonglass from his chest.

Making the wights collapse and turning the WW's back human as NK dies a mortal man. Anyways a Proto-Democratic Government/Republic is established with there no longer being one ruler but multiple rulers for each kingdom. Tyrion gets Westerlands, Edmure gets the Riverlands, Robin keeps the Vale, Sam gets the Reach, A likeable Sand Snake gets Dorne, and new houses get Pyke and Stormlands. Sansa gets the North and both Arya and Gendry decide to sail to land more west together.

Jon gets the Crownlands and raises his twin children on his own and Sam writes the Song of Ice and Fire. The bittersweet ending is that the war was won but at a great cost as Westeros was left in ruin and Jon lost yet another lover. However If Sansa dies then Arya gets the North with gendry taking the stark name or Arya and Gendry get the Crownlands with Jon ruling the north.",gameofthrones,True,1532538557,2018-07-25

[SPOILERS] I think the Night King is a lot smarter than we think and might be connected to the Lord of Light.,"Alright guys, put ont your tin foil hat, I've thought about something while re-watching ""Beyond the wall"".

I thought it was weird that The Hound saw the mountain with the arrowhead in a vision, which is where everyone ended up being trap by the Night King, and where the Night King got his dragon. So I wondered, what if the Night King actually had planned everyting and is connected to the Lord Light..

The Night King wanted one thing: to destroyed the Wall. In order to do that, he needed a dragon. And in order to have a dragon, he needed what have happened in the episode ""Beyond the wall"": Daenerys come flying with the dragons to save Jon.

So, firstable, Daenerys and Jon needed to meet. They met, because Melisandre, whose actions are dictated by visions in the flames, told Daenerys to send a raven to Winterfell.

Why was Melisandre in the south ? Because, Jon forced her to leave, when he learned about what she did to Shireen, which is what the Lord of Light asked.

And this happened, because she saw a vision in the flames in season 3, that told her to go North with Stannis, and especially, Davos who, as she said, has a role to play. (He's the reason Melisandre was exiled from the North)

So, the Lord of Light brought Daenarys and Jon together, to fight the dead, or to give TNK what he needed...

The reason why I think TNK is behind all of this, is because I think that he is a lot smarter than we think and that he actually planned everything. The visions in the flames seem to have lead to what happened in ""Eastmarch"", and what happened in this episode seem to have been planned by The Night King since Day 1, in order to cross the wall.

Everytime the army of the dead attacked the Night Watch, they let someone escaped. In the first episode, they let Will run away, in the season 2, they saw Sam and kept him alive. At Hardhome, they only attacked once Jon was there and they didn't kill him, even when the white walker had the opportunity to. Jon lost his sword, and the WW just pushed him down, while he killed the Thenn the second he had the chance. Why ? Because he needed Jon to know how big of a threat the army of the dead is.

So, Jon Snow' focus is on the army of the dead, and he met Daenarys. Now, it's time to bring the group North of the Wall and trapped them.

So, there's the vision of the mountain with the arrowhead, and Bran sees TNK at this exact same spot. TNK is actually baiting them. He want Jon and the group to come behind the wall and it worked. Then, they must trapped them there to force Daenarys to come, so TNK send a small group of wights just in front of the location he wanted them. When Jon and the others start the attack, they charged at them, not to kill them, to trapped them. You can see wights running ahead of Jon and the others, because they wanted to surround them. And then, they waited. The White Walkers could have easily killed them, why are they waiting ? For the dragon. Which is why they came prepared with their ice javelin and probably their chains too.

Finally, the magic behind the dragons returned soon after the White Walkers appeared. So, it's possible that the Night King is also behind this.

Now, the Night King has his dragon and is ready to fuck Westeros big time.

TL;DR: The Night King is a lot smarter than we think, and he planned everything since the beginning to cross the wall.",gameofthrones,True,1532545096,2018-07-25

[SPOILERS] How would the Lannister dynamic be different if Jaime had been born as a dwarf and Tyrion had not?,"Tywin's heir would have been a dwarf from the very beginning but with Johanna living, Jaime might have avoided some of his bile. However, Cersei would presumably hate him for his deformities and still being heir despite them. It would also be insult on top of injury since they shared a womb.

Tyrion being able-bodied but still killing Johanna in childbirth could turn his father and sister away from him though. 

Do you think Jaime would have an accident? Or maybe given to the Citadel? If they all lived to adulthood, would Tyrion protect Jaime like Jaime did him? And how would Cersei's marriage to Robert play out differently with no Jaime around?",gameofthrones,True,1532553587,2018-07-25

(SPOILERS) How I think the show will play out.,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1532556039,2018-07-25

[SPOILERS] My thoughts of how the show will play out.,"I have been rewatching the series from season 5 to season 7. ""The door' episode I think has some insight to how the show will play out. When Bran becomes the 3 eye raven he see Aerys Targaryen saying ""burn them all"". What the show leads us to believe is he is saying burn Tywin and his army with the city, but what I think he is truly saying is burn the wights because Bran speaks to him through his mind which ultimately drives the mad king crazy. I believe that bran inspire the mad king to mass produce wild fire not to kill The mad king initial enemy's, but for the future war to come against the Night King. 

Also, I believe that Gendry is actually Cersy first born son. Now I am not certain how Gendry became a orphan and also, if Cercy is even is aware that he is even alive. I also believe that Cersy and Jamie are really the Children of Aerys. The book hints that Aerys made comments to Tywin that he would sleep with with his wife. Now when I read that my first thoughts were that Tyrion was the son of Aerys because of Tywins distaste for him and the remarks that he wasnt sure he was his even his son, and also the dragons didnt devourer him on sight when he release the 2 remaining dragons in the dungeons in meereen. Another reason why I think Jamie and Cercy are indeed Targaryens is the saying that it's a flip of a coin that a Targaryen will be crazy. Now cercy is clearly mad, and Jamie has a moral code and compassion for people. These 2 theory of Gendry and Cercy would mean that Gendry is the rightful heir to the throne. Not only is he the first born of Robert Baretheon which Baretheon are Descendants of Targaryen, but his mother is a Targaryen which would give him a edge over Jon for the throne. 

I also believe that Gendry is Azor ahai and Jon is the prince that is Promise. In the books it was said that Azor ahai was a Black smith. The only Black smith on the show is Gendry. Now in the books it has been said that Azor ahai and the prince that is promise isnt necessary the same person. So I believe Gendry will produce the sword to Jon and Jon will Pludge Dany in the heart to ignite LightBringer. 

Now I will end this with a Vague conclusion. The Night king will drive Jon and his forces all the way down to Kingslanding, and where ultimately jon will decide to Sacrifice himself and his Army with the Wild fire that Aerys was instructed by Bran to produce. Leaving Gendry as the Ruler of the ashes. Now I have more thoughts of how Arya, Jamie, Cercy, and ect character will play out, but I feel that that Gendry and Jon are the 2 most important characters when the show finishes. Also I know I am not the first to come up with all this theory because when I thought of them I did a Google search and seen some of these theorys, but everything I have said was all thoughts that came to me by over analyzing the show when i rewatch them.

[SPOILERS] My crazy season 8 pairing,"I’m prepared to be downvoted to hell for this, but I’ve had it stuck in my head for days and I think it’s certainly possible (although highly improbable) and at the very least, something to think about. Anyway, here goes...

Sansa Stark and Dolorous Edd. 

If you haven’t immediately left this post yet, let me explain my thinking. 

First things first, Jonsa is not a real possibility, nor do I want it to be, for the record. 

I really do love the idea of Sansa realizing she does not need a man in her life to be happy. I would love to see her fully transition from being a girl who fantasized about marrying the handsome prince to truly seeing just what awful things those handsome princes can do and growing into an independently powerful leader. Still, as a Sansa fan and a bit of a romantic, I’d like to see her actually find someone to be happy with too.  Just like her father, Jon, and Robb, there are good men, but unfortunately she only really encountered the worst of the worst and she ended up being manipulated, abused, and raped instead. Her views on men and possibly people in general are probably not great, and reasonably so. 

So how does Edd fit in? I was watching an episode in Season 6 (4, I believe) where there was a quiet moment at the table when Sansa, Jon, Edd, Brienne, Tormund, etc., are eating, and Edd apologizes for the state of the food, and Sansa smiles and says there are more important things. We see just the hint of a smile on Edd’s face — one of the only times we ever see one! Then it all clicked. 

Edd is good and honest. He is one of Jon’s best friends. As far as we know, he does not torture people like Joffrey, manipulate like Littlefinger, or abuse women like Ramsay —he escaped from the mutiny at Craster’s Keep, for instance, and didn’t just stay there like the some of the others to rape and beat Craster’s daughters. Basically, he is loyal and uncomplicated, the same qualities her father and brothers shared. He is not traditionally handsome, no, but he’s not half bad and he would treat Sansa with respect. 

I even think Sansa would appreciate his dark sense of humor, especially after everything she has gone through. She also needs a calm, simple presence to keep her from going full on power hungry, and she could for once have a healthy relationship. In turn, I think she could bring out perhaps a gentler side of Edd that we have never seen before, like the moment at the dinner table. 

Why I think this could (although probably won’t) happen:

He is Lord Commander now. Assuming he lives to the end (which, unfortunately, I’m doubting), it would be a good idea to be friends with the Wardeness of the North, which is where I’m predicting Sansa will end up. The Night’s Watch is not supposed to be politically involved, but having the support of a powerful Northern family would be useful in supplying men, food, weapons, etc., for the Wall. Even if the humans win against the white walkers, I’m guessing the Night’s Watch will be needing a lot more men by the time this is all over, and they may want to even start manning more castles in case the threat ever comes back. And what better way to build a strong alliance than through a marriage, say, to the Wardeness of the North, and the person who can easily supply you with all of those things?

But, average_fish, you say, men of the Night’s Watch cannot get married. No, not right now, but if things go how I think they will, with Jon ultimately ending up on the iron throne, this theory notwithstanding, I feel like he would allow the Night’s Watch, Kingsguard, and maesters to marry, especially after growing up ostracized as a bastard (more marriage theoretically means there will be less out of wedlock children), his own experiences with love, and people like Sam, who are in love but have to hide it because of their vows. I’m not quite sure how it would work logistically (Can criminals at the wall get married? Where will wives/children stay?) but I definitely can see that happening. 

Anyway, that’s my idea. It’s nuts, but I just had to get it out there. It hinges on a lot of different things happening, and I doubt it would ever happen because it’s just so random, but I would love for these two to get a happy ending. ",gameofthrones,True,1532569969,2018-07-25
[Spoilers] Bran really gave us a vision of the future...,"I haven’t seen this discussed here yet and I’ve looked for it. When rewatching the end of season 7 my wife and I noticed something. 

When the final season started, it kicks off with Bran in the Godswood. The ravens then fly north of the wall. We see Beric and Tormund on top of the wall. WW and the dead army come out. Next thing we know is dead Viseryon and the NK are taking down the wall. 

Most everyone that I’ve heard talk about this says it is happening in real time. What about Bran seeing this in the future? This would make sure that the armies of the living will defend the right part of the wall instead of sending troops to castle black or wherever. 

Thoughts on this? ",gameofthrones,True,1532570250,2018-07-25
Robb Stark is insufferable,"I am currently rewatching the whole series (never read the books). I remember the first watch through, hating Walder Frey with a passion, and being so shocked and saddened at the Red Wedding. But going back through it, and leading up to the Rains of Castamere, I was absolutely sickened by Robb Stark's actions and character. He was such an idiot and I found myself actually rooting for Frey to just kill the stupid SoB. 
•He makes and breaks his promise to marry his daughter, with the corniest love storyline ever. 
• He then tucks himself over by killing Karstark. Losing half of his forces in the process.
•Because he made that decision, he now needs help AGAIN for Lord Frey, and fully expects him to forgive and forget, AND HELP him win a losing battle.
• He bullied his uncle into marrying the Frey girl, expecting his uncle to fix his screw up.
•He lost Winterfell because he trusted Theon not to screw him over.
•He brings his wife (the symbol of his betrayal) to meet Lord Frey, being cocky and stupid. Not expecting any backlash.
•Attends the wedding and after being shot by arrows, his mother begs him to leave and offers up her own life after ALL of his mistakes, but he just sits there with tears in his eyes and refuses to even try to escape. Not thinking of his mother who would surely be killed, or the siblings still out there who will surely be in danger of paying for his war.
•After the wedding, Roose even makes a comment about Robb saying: ""He ignored my council at every turn, if he'd only been a trifle less arrogant.."" 


By the time he FINALLY got shot with arrows, I was almost cheering. And when he was holding his stupid dead wife he gave up everything for who got stabbed, I was almost happy. Robb Stark was a failure and upon review of the series, he made countless mistakes that I feel made him deserve  the events of the Red Wedding. I hate Robb Stark and I think he is insufferable. He deserved everything he got and he is an idiot who brought alot of grief to his family by being arrogant and stupid. I was kind of shocked that I came to this realization, due to the complete 180 I took from watching it the first time. I am glad Robb is dead and I can 100% empathize with Walder Frey. I still love Arya, Sansa and Jon tho.

[SPOILERS] GAME OF THRONES EASTER EGG,"so folks, i am going to shoot the matter straight

*Processing img umqol1ddf9c11...*

baratheon sigil over kingslanding in SEASON 7

see the pic above?? its a stag sigil over kingslanding in the opening credits, **in season 7**.

we all know that when cersei began her tyranny, she was proclaimed as ***""cersei of house lannister"".***

she then proceeded to remove all symbols of house baratheon and replaced it with lannister lion as is evident in season 7. and all members of house baratheon are dead, save a bastard who is not even recognized in the wider public.

yet the showrunners still chose to put the stag sigil over kingslanding in the opening credits instead of lannister lion.

makes it all the more mysterious. some say it was out of laziness. how can that be when the showrunners had time to replace the bolton sigil with the stark one, in two consecutive episodes within a single season? yet why didnt they replace the stag sigil even though they had one full year, enough time and a whole season to run?

this is why it is an **easter egg**. it is no error from the part of the showrunners. rather, it is a clue given by the showrunners to solve a puzzle for those who are keen observers.

now what does this really signify??

house baratheon is ""extinct"" we are told. and we are told that the only remnant of house baratheon is an unrecognised ""bastard"" who goes by the name gendry. ( gentry means highborn, pun intended?)

if that was the case, then the stag sigil doesnt make sense. it should be expelled into obscurity like the rest of house baratheon.

however, the fact that they still show stag sigil implies that house baratheon is very much alive.

for gendry was not a bastard, all this time, he was actually the trueborn son of robert and cersei. hence, the significance of baratheon sigil over the capital of westeros.

this theory makes perfect sense why the stag sigil is shown in KL.

for more reasons on why gendry is the son of cersei , check these links below

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x1hd5/spoilers\_gendry\_cersei\_theory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x1hd5/spoilers_gendry_cersei_theory/)

for those who **say that the maggy the frog prophecy stipulates/limits cersei's children to 3** see this link below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers\_maggy\_the\_frog\_prophesy\_loophole/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers_maggy_the_frog_prophesy_loophole/)

also this theory makes an amazing parallel with of the roses. check the link

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x84x2/spoliers\_war\_of\_the\_roses\_theory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x84x2/spoliers_war_of_the_roses_theory/)

now the real reason why they actually put the baratheon sigil over KL could be that cersei would be ruling on behalf of gendry after all. we have to understand the mental state of cersei. she lost her 3 kids in the game of thrones. she is a fierce mother, and is unwilling to put the life of her only remaining son at stake; especially when she is surrounded by enemies. so she decides to take the throne for herself, eliminate all her enemies, and then when the job is done, she could reveal his true identity and proclaim him the king. so this makes perfect sense why they would put the stag sigil above KL.

as a side note, this also explains why cersei promised to marry the brotherkiller euron, ***""after the war is won.""***since she plans to step down from the iron throne and make gendry the king when she wins the war, the iron throne is safe from eurons manipulations. thus she was able to get two shots with one move, ensuring the loyalty of the deicisive ironborn fleet and also ensure her security since her son is now king and she no longer needs to fear harm from euron if she marries him.

also the secret deal between tyrion and cersei might actually be to make gendry the king. for more details on what actually might have happened in their secret meeting, check the link below

[https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/8y86pi/what\_really\_happened\_at\_tyrion\_cersei\_secret/](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/8y86pi/what_really_happened_at_tyrion_cersei_secret/)

some might ask: *""why did cersei abandon gendry in the first place?""*

answer is simple: **robert used to rape cersei**. gendry was a child born out of rape. not all mothers would want grow up a child that symbolises one of the most horrific incidents in their life. in the case of cersei, her husband robert hated her, used to pour wine over her, raped her and came to her in bed and screamed ""lyanna"", ""lyanna"" moaning over the loss of his true love. as a result, cersei grew up to hate him so hard and she decided not to share an offspring with him.

another question is: *""how noone realised that cersei was pregnant? how could she abandon him so easily?""*

answer: ***nobody said that*** noone realised cersei was pregnant. infact, ofcourse people were aware of her pregnancy. the trick lies in how she abandoned gendry. she swapped gendry for a similar looking dead baby and gave up gendry to another woman, possibly with jaime's help. as cersei told ned in the books , "" ***jaime found a woman to cleanse me of it***""

*so what happened to gendry after cersei abandoned him?*

ans: after cersei abandoned gendry, later on her motherly instincts resurged and she began to feel remorse over what she did. however, it was too late by then. she could not take gendry back, for if she revealed what she did, the lives of her incestous children and her own would be at stake. so she decided to let him be in the slums. **in the books, cersei used to sneak out as a tavernwench to visit the slums of kingslanding, the same slums where gendry grew up.** gendry himself had stated that his mother was a tavernwench.

*how did gendry end up with tobho mott, the most famous blacksmith in westeros?*

in [http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gendry](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Gendry) it states

&gt;***When he was old enough, an unknown lord paid his apprentice fee so he could learn to be a blacksmith.***

also in [https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gendry](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gendry) it states

&gt;***When Gendry was old enough, an unknown lord paid his apprentice fee so he could learn to be a blacksmith***

*who is this ""unknown lord""?*

some say its varys, but that is pure ridiculous. varys may have made contact with a few other bastards of robert, but that was becuase they were known. gendry on the other hand, was a literal unknown until jon arryn finds him years later. before jon visited gendry, he was a total nobody and noone seemed to think he was of any significance. this *""unknown lord""* might well be a character ( most probably jaime, since he is a knight as well) under cersei's orders. why would anybody want a poor nobody in the slums to learn smithing from the most reputed westerosi blacksmith? this indicates that it was cersei who wanted her son to be in that position. so this implies that she arranged for the apprenticeship of gendry, right under her nose, and she also can watch him grow.

*also what was the secret jon arryn discovered before he died?*

we are told that jon arryn discovered the fact that 3 official children of robert were not actually his.

really? let us look.

one of the last things jon arryn did before dying was that he visited gendry in his shop. he also asked questions about his mother. a few weeks(or days) later, he was poisoned.

and its all the more mysterious that before dying, the last words of jon arryn to robert was ***""the seed is strong***"".

this implies that what jon discovered was that not only the 3 official children of robert were incestous but also that gendry is the only trueborn son of robert and cersei.

ned thought he really discovered why jon arryn died for, but he was wrong. he only discovered one half of it. he made serious mistake in assuming gendry to be a bastard.

that also explains the way cersei reacted to ned.

ned tells cersei: ***""i know why jon arryn died for.""***

cersei replies:""***do you, lord stark?""***

well folks, that was a long post. but there are many more reasons and details into this matter, but i dont wish to lengthen this post.

so, do share your thoughts on the matter.

[SPOILERS] Why Sansa is My favourite Character,"I think if we did poll of who everyone’s favourite character was Tyrion would win quite handily. Other popular choices would be Jon and Dany of course and I think Bronn would get a lot of love but I suspect my choice would be nearer the bottom of the list; I love the Sansa character.

Everyone else gets the best lines, they get to be cool, they get the epic action scenes but it’s Sansa’s journey that most fascinates me, she is simply the most tragic figure in Game of Thrones. When we first meet her she’s the stereotypical stuck up and vacuous girl, she hates her home and dreams of living in the glamourous city of King’s Landing. When she learns that she’s to marry the heir to the throne she thinks all her dreams have come true, she’s completely oblivious to the horror she’s about to endure.

She gets her first dose of reality when Joffrey tries to bully Mycah and her wolf ends up dead, this is just the start. Whilst betrothed to Joffrey she suffers humiliation, emotional and physical abuse; she starts to understand the hell she’s living and appreciate what she had before. She thinks she’s getting relief when Joffrey drops her for Margaery, she even thinks she’s going to finally get her happy ending when she’s betrothed to Loras (which is doubly tragic as she doesn't understand his sexuality), but this brief happiness is robbed from her as well.

It’s during this period she becomes a survivor, she learns how to protect herself, emotionally at least, and stay out of trouble, she’s on the road to becoming a cynic rather than the naieve little girl she was. She’s forced to marry Tyrion, which she goes along with, but she can’t see that he represents the best life she’s been offered so far, he’s a good man, he would treat her well, respect her and keep her safe but to her he’s a Lannister, and Lannisters killed her family.

When she escapes King’s landing she’s now a protégé of Littlefinger, she knows he’s untrustworthy but she thinks she can predict what he’ll do and, at least, she’ll be safe. This in itself comes crashing down when he convinces her to marry Ramsey and leads to her worst experience yet. By the time, she watches Ramsey be eaten by his own hounds the girl she was is long gone. What’s left is an emotionally scarred, cynical husk of a women who struggles to connect to her own family. She’s learned lessons however, she doesn’t suffer the other Stark’s naivety, she’s cunning and ruthless. 

There’s some suggestion that, by the end of the show, she’ll basically be Cersai, but I’m hoping that they don’t go down that route. Sansa is a survivor, she’s been through hell and come out the other side, whilst Cersai’s experience made her selfish and sadistic, Sansa’s can make her wise, pragmatic but still compassionate. 

She’s not funny, she’s not cool, but her arc is brilliant and so much more interesting than everyone else’s, that’s why she’s my favourite character.  ",gameofthrones,True,1532620143,2018-07-26
"[SPOILERS] I found the beginning of Season 5 to be a little bit boring and quite repetitive, but I just finished watching Hardhome and it's my second favorite episode of the show!","A couple of days ago, I shared my thoughts on Season 4 of Game of Thrones ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/91ny2s/spoilers\_in\_my\_opinion\_season\_4\_of\_games\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/91ny2s/spoilers_in_my_opinion_season_4_of_games_of/) ). A season I consider the greatest TV Season ever put to screen. It had everything I dreamed it would have, but that's not the topic for this post.

I started watching Season 5 yesterday and although it had some fine plot elements in it, I really did not find myself invested in the characters, the action and the plot development as I did with Season 3 or 4. Not that it was bad, but it just was ""there"" and not the GoT level I was used to. Episode 7 finally was a really good episode with some nice elements but oh my god. The following Episode ""Hardhome"" was one of the best TV episodes I have ever seen!  


I am a smart guy. If I see things teased and built up, I love it when these things finally happen and the storylines intertwine.  
The dialogue between Daenerys and Tyrion was absolutely amazing. ""Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, Targaryen, Tyrell, they're all just spikes in a wheel"". That's a direction I never thought would be possible. It opens so much room for more and inventive outcomes. It's amazing to finally see a Lannister &amp; Daenerys meet, because well, that's actually what the Series has been building up to. 

It's also really tough to think about what has happened to the Lannisters. Tywin is dead, Joffrey is dead, Tommon is broken, Cersei is imprisoned, Jaime has only one hand and Tyrion is somewhere where no one knows him. Comparing this with lets say the End of Season One is really thought provoking.

But of course, the real highlight are the White Walkers here. The last twenty minutes are blockbuster action stuff. It's frightening, but also stunning. How did a TV show manage to pull this kind of stuff of? The White Walkers were teased for 4 and a half fucking Seasons and FINALLY they are here. And they seem invincible as fuck. When they kill  a human, he becomes one of [them.](https://them.How) How cool is that?? And the last shot with Jon Snow (my favorite character) realizing that is truly a thing of beauty.",gameofthrones,True,1532620745,2018-07-26

[SPOILERS] THE SEED IS STRONG,"***""The seed is strong""*** \- these were the dying words of jon arryn to robert baratheon.

in this post, i intend to discuss what really the hand to the king, intended to convey to robert baratheon.

we are told that *""seed is strong*"" refers to the fact that when a baratheon made an offspring with another woman, the baratheon trait of black hair always predominated.

wonder where this assumption come from??? this was the same assumption that ned stark made in the books. now i am going to convey why ned stark was wrong about jon arryn all along. he thought he knew the truth jon arryn died for. he did, but just one half of it.

now let us travel to the actions of jon arryn before his death.

a few weeks( or days) before his death, jon arryn visted gendry in his shop. he then asked gendry questions about his mother.

why did jon arryn visit only gendry? why not other bastards? why did he have a special interest in gendry?

the reason is, jon arryn somehow found out that gendry is actually the trueborn son of robert and cersei.

so coming back to jon arryn:

after he visits gendry, a few days later, jon arryn is poisoned and succumbs to his death.

jon arryn didnt get the chance to reveal the truth about gendry to his king.

just before he succumbs to his death, king robert arrives and he barely manages to say, ***""the seed is strong.""***

now where did ned go wrong? ned learned about the last words of jon arryn from grandmaester pycelle.

however he interprets it to just mean that baratheon hair predominate in a real baratheon offspring.

whereas in reality, what jon arryn meant was that **king robert still had a legitimate trueborn heir.**

so ned was able to discern only one half of what jon arryn discovered, namely that the three official children of king robert were not actually his, but he mistook gendry for a bastard.

even when ned learned that jon arryn asked about gendry's mother, still ned didnt have a clue.

let me  know what you think about this in the comments

[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones: Night King Questions,"**Disclaimer:** I've watched quite a number of fan theories. But I've not seen the answer to the below questions in any of these:

1. In Bran's vision, he observed the creation of the current Night King. The guy who was being converted to Night King was all tied up and did not like being converted so. In fact, it appears as if he was very scared. **Why was he so scared?**  
\- Now I see theories which postulates Azhor Ahai to be night king(in fact I myself thought so), the legend says that Azhor Ahai defeated all the white walkers before. Would he be so scared ?   
\- Many theories suggest that someone purposely wanted to become night king to control some of the white walkers. This theory makes sense, but **that** scene does n't.  
**-  Why was he tied up?**   
\- I refuse to believe that the new night king is the same one first created by children of forest. I feel Children of forest created a night king before and then there was the great war. Men defeated and possibly killed the old night king.  
\- Children of Forest were allies to men during the war. Why will they purposefully convert a man by tying him up?  

2. Was Bran falling from the window pane ""**accidental**""(Yeah Ser Jamie pushed him and all that) ? **Why did he climb to that specific window pane? He got access to all his ""visions"" after this incident.**  

3. **What did Meera mean by ""you died in the cave that day"" ?** 
4. Why did Lord Bloodraven guide Bran to Children of Forest cave ? 
5. Most importantly **why is the night king attacking now?** Is it in anyway connected to Bran? ",gameofthrones,True,1532629567,2018-07-26

[Contest] You can now enter our simplified S8 deadpool! (with prizes),"**TL;DR: We have a deadpool. It's a very simple one – you pick alive/undead/dead. You can win prizes. Enter before leaks if you want them.**

It's inevitable that there will be some major leaks prior to season eight (and some stuff is already known, to be fair). So, in an attempt to get at least a little ahead of the game and give people some off-season fun, we've created a deadpool.

This is a really simplified version – no odds or anything, just picking alive/dead/undead for a bunch of characters.

Rules:

1. If a character is not mentioned in any way, they are assumed to have ended the season alive  
2. If there is a time jump for an epilogue (e.g. Jon dying of old age), it will be excluded  
3. Your account must have joined Reddit at least four months ago

**Prizes**

We're being a little vague on prizes just now, because it'll depend on how many people enter – but at least the winner will get some Reddit gold be able to choose something from the prize pool – [here's a link to a pic showing the pool](https://i.imgur.com/0r8Xrfx.jpg)

**Deadline**

We'd recommend getting in quickly. When news of character deaths starts leaking, we'll start considering whether to shut the deadpool. While we'll keep it open for entries, those who enter after that won't be able to win a prize.

**Other stuff**

At some point we'll post the pie charts of people's predictions – just to give an idea of what the prevailing view on the sub is for the fate of characters! And if anyone wants a formatted copy of their entry, get in touch with myself/through modmail and we'll send that over.

"[SPOILERS] Season 5 delivers two absolutely amazing episodes, but fails to recapture the continuity, epic and greatness of Season 4 and really has some pacing issues","A couple of days ago I wrote about the fourth Season of Game of Thrones ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/91ny2s/spoilers\_in\_my\_opinion\_season\_4\_of\_games\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/91ny2s/spoilers_in_my_opinion_season_4_of_games_of/) ), a Season I consider to be the greatest TV Season ever put to screen.

Now I finished binge watching Season 5 in two days and here are some thoughts I have on it:

  
I think that the first half (I think until episode 6) is kind of boring for GoT levels. It's definitely not bad as a TV show, but it was missing something I loved in Season 4. I think that the narration in the first 6 episodes was a bit slow and I wasn't invested in all plot elements. I never really gave a shit about Brienne, and for the most part wasn't interested in here scenes. The Arya stuff will probably be very important for future seasons since I believe that she will turn out as one of the big characters, but it also wasn't as interesting to see as lets say her Season 4 alliance with Clegan. 

Now onto the good parts; I think Daenerys character archetype in this season is the most straightforward. Finally we see some storyline intertwining with amazing Tyrion Lannister and her meeting, which caused an amazing dialogue at Episode 8 and hopefully will bring lots of stuff for the future. Seeing Cersei being imprisoned and then humiliated by that religious group is definitely interesting to see, because it shows at how drastically things have changed for the Lannisters (Jaime one arm, she imprisoned, Tyrion betrayed family, Tywin dead, Tommon too young, Joffrey dead..). And of course the stuff with Jon Snow was amazing.

""Hardhome"" is one of the best TV episodes I have ever seen. It feels like blockbuster action, perfectly put together and serves every purpose for the storyline. The White Walkers are finally here (yeah I know they are bastards but they are really bad ass and I love when teased things actually happened), I also really loved Episode 9 ""The Dance of Dragons"" which showcased some great stuff in Meereen and with Drogon.

But I really have to say that the season finale left me cold. Stannis was one of my favorite characters of the show, and this really felt bad. I mean I get it, he made terrible mistakes and the Bolton's burned their horses (or something like that), but if you want me to believe that his journey is finally over, then please let me see the battle. It all felt rushed. From one episode to another he went from completely bad ass strong man to dead. I often complain about the pacing being slow (especially in Season 2/3), but here the pacing was WAY to fast. I mean Stannis ""revenge"" was built for like 4 seasons and then he loses of screen?   
And of course the final shot, Jon Snow getting betrayed and ""killed"", though he definitely will not be dead.

Over all, Season 5 had some amazing stuff in it (Hardhome/Dance of the Dragons), but the script did not always feel tight and crisp and it missed the continuity. It's a very ""sad"" and depressing (all likable characters are either dead, or captured) season that provides some game changing changes (sounds weird) like the White Walkers, and the Sparrows and the Boltons (that Ramsey guy is the new Joffrey).

[SPOILERS] WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN TYRION CERSEI SECRET MEETING - MY TAKE,"Hi folks, this is my take on what really went down at tyrion cersei secret meeting in season 7.

I think that some sort of deal happened in that mostly offscreen meeting.

Let's first start by analysing the relevant part of THEIR CONVERSATION IN SEASON 7 EPISODE 7

Tyrion: ""*if there's no future, then why are we here? why did you allow me to come?*""

Cersei:""*Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.*""

Tyrion:""*Yes, no. Its not that you hoped for, but you* ***must have hoped for something!***""

( Tyrion is basically trying to give cersei a concession. he directly asks what cersei wants)

Cersei:"" *what did you hope for? to make jon snow submit to your queen*?""

( well, seems like cersei have some other intentions)

Tyrion:""*Not like this*""

Cersei:"" *but eventually you want him to have to bend the knee to her.*""

Tyrion: ""*YES*""

Cersei:""**WHY?**""(Hmmm what is cerseis intention here?)

( cersei is basically asking tyrion the reason **why he allied with Daenarys.** )

Tyrion:""*Because I think she would make the world a better place*"" 

Cersei:""**YOU SAID SHE WOULD DESTROY KINGS LANDING!**""

(HEY FOLKS, the entire tone and WAY of this conversation makes me a bit doubtful.**CERSEI IS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE TO TYRION THAT DEANARYS IS not his desired monarch**. IS SHE IMPLYING THERE COULD BE ANOTHER **WHO IS BETTER THAN DEANARYS?**)

(**NOTE THE MENTAL STATE OF TYRION**\- **he's clearly disappointed in Dany not listening to him, burning tarlys, burning lannisters, refusing his request to create a line of succession to iron throne** and other tensions- that was his character arc the entire season 7.Hes clearly losing hope in Dany)

Tyrion: ""*she knows herself. she chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them. thats the difference between you*.""

And then Cersei says: ""*I dont care about checking my worst impulses; I dont care about making the world a better place. That thing you dragged here; i dont know what it is; i dont know what it means; and when it came at me I didnt think about the world not at all. As soon as  it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me right down its black throat. All i could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from* ***the ONES who matter most****, away from my family.*""

(FOLKS!She says ""***the ONES who matter most***"". Its surely more than one. One is jaime, who is the other? the foetus in her womb is not even a person and she is barely 2 or 3 months pregnant)

Cersei proceeds: "" *Maybe euron greyjoy had the right idea. get on a boat, take those who matter...*""

TYRION interrupts:""*YOU ARE PREGNANT*.""

**THE SCENE ABRUPTLY CUTS.**

The conversation is abruptly cut here. we dont know what they said afterwards.

now let us have a quick recap from the books and show and then link this conversation to the wider story arc.

In the books Deanarys is prophecised to have 3 betrayals- for gold,for blood,**and for love**. In the show Dany already had the first two.

**I THINK THE NEXT BETRAYAL WILL BE FROM TYRION FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FAMILY AND WESTEROS.**

This is why I think Dany will die. Possibly out of poisoning orchestrated by Tyrion to make it look as if she would die from pregnancy.(its confirmed that Dany would die at childbirth next season. Dany actor said about her role in season 8 ***""It f\*\*\*\* me up""***. see the link  [https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/23/emilia-clarke-says-daenerys-weird-ending-game-thrones-fcked-7572979/](https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/23/emilia-clarke-says-daenerys-weird-ending-game-thrones-fcked-7572979/) &amp; [https://www.bustle.com/p/daenerys-final-game-of-thrones-scene-apparently-really-messed-with-emilia-clarke-9189758](https://www.bustle.com/p/daenerys-final-game-of-thrones-scene-apparently-really-messed-with-emilia-clarke-9189758)).

so this is why I think dany would die in season 8, most probably by poisoning during her labour. I dont know maybe tyrion would use samwell tarly to posion her. (remember dany burned his dad and brother alive.)

Now, coming to the next part.

who are ""***the ONES who matter most***"" that cersei mentions? 

one we know for sure is jaime. who is other?? its obviously not tyrion, nor can it be the unborn foetus in her womb, since she is barely 3 or 2 months pregnant.

so for many such reasons I have come to the assumption that **she's referring to gendry.**

**yeah, I think gendry is the trueborn son of robert and cersei and the rightful heir to the iron throne.**

I came to this conclusion for many reasons. see these links below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8xzb1y/spoilers\_cersei\_gendry\_theory\_season\_7\_hints/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8xzb1y/spoilers_cersei_gendry_theory_season_7_hints/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x1hd5/spoilers\_gendry\_cersei\_theory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8x1hd5/spoilers_gendry_cersei_theory/)

for those who **say that the maggy the frog prophecy stipulates/limits cersei's children to 3** see this link below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers\_maggy\_the\_frog\_prophesy\_loophole/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8wzwhn/spoilers_maggy_the_frog_prophesy_loophole/)

so for these reasons i have come to the conclusion that Gendry is trueborn son of Cersei and Robert and her only surviving kid. so what I have concluded is that **cersei revealed the truth about Gendry to Tyrion** in the offscreen conversation.  

Also, remember that **cersei allowed ser davos to meet up with gendry.** ( she tells jaime that she allowed the meeting between jaime and tyrion to happen. **by analogy**, this would mean that she also allowed ser davos to smuggle gendry out of kings landing.) why would she do this?? the logical explanation is that **she wanted gendry to meetup with tyrion.** she knew tyrion wouldnt hurt gendry. we know how all that unfolded, gendry saved tyrions life from the guards and the two developed a close friendship.

so what really happened in that secret meeting? what was the deal that Tyrion made with Cersei?

I think that **Tyrion offered Cersei to kill Daenarys**, most probably through poisoning . ( or probably cersei demanded it from him.) and then he would **give allegiance to Gendry.** In return cersei would **offer to fight against the undead** in the coming Great War. yeah, cersei would basically wait until the undead army destroys winterfell and then join up with the remnants of northern army to fight the undead. **SO BASICALLY, CERSEI AGREED NOT TO FIGHT WITH NORTHERN-ESSOSI COALITION OF DANY AND JON, BUT TO JOIN THE FIGHT AT A LATER STAGE WHEN THE NORTHERN-ESSOSI COALITION IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED.**

this makes complete sense.

Although he is a commoner and a blackmsith who grew up in a slum,**GENDRY IS A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR TYRION**.Gendry is a commoner, he can **BREAK the wheel**.Also **GENDRY SAVED TYRIONS LIFE** IN KINGSLANDING FROM THE GUARDS.

 some people say that nope,Cersei was negotiating about putting her baby(foetus) in the iron throne. I cant see how this is happening.Dany will never agree to the child of cersei to succeed her.Also, **Tyrion is looking for a monarch to rule**, not a baby. Tyrion is not that stupid to betray Dany for Cersei. However,GENDRY FITS PERFECTLY FOR TYRION. TYRION WOULD PREFER GENDRY TO DANY ANY TIME. ALSO **GENDRY IS HIS FAMILY.**

AND THE FUNNY PART? GENDRY WONT KNOW ANY OF THIS UNTIL THE VERY LAST EPISODE WHEN HE IS REVEALED AS THE SON OF CERSEI.

**AND THIS IS WHY THE SHOWRUNNERS STILL SHOW A STAG SIGIL OVER KINGSLANDING. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT???**

yeah, that's it folks. I'm done , took a long time.

For me there's several but the biggest has to be the slaying of King Roberts bastard children. Originally I had no clue what was going on. I felt pretty silly for not catching it. All I knew is that they were snatching kids and infants left and right. I had no clue why, I just knew it was horrible.

[SPOILERS] Daenerys and the number three,"okay so possible spoilers, this is my first reddit post and I'm unsure of how all this works, so please forgive any mistakes but I've pondered on this for a while and haven't seen anyone address it after lurking for a while, so I got brave and decided to come ask myself if anyone else has noticed this.

I have only watched the show and not read the books as of right now.

okay so I've noticed the number 3 is connected to daenerys A LOT. the three heads of the dragon, the fact that her mother has had three children, the fact that as of right now she's had three lovers, etc, 

also i noticed that in order for her dragons to hatch she had to essentially sacrifice three people. She due to her actions whether she knew the things that would happen or not sacrificed rhaego for drogo, then had to sacrifice drogo out of mercy, she then sacrificed Mirri out of revenge. There's that number 3 again, that in the end result caused three dragons to be born. 

Maybe i'm just thinking too much into it but its got to be foreshadowing future events, maybe perhaps she even winds up birthing twins, to set her number of children to 3. Forgive my rambling it's just really been nagging at me and no one i know watches it to get into a discussion about it. ",gameofthrones,True,1531362864,2018-07-11

Mine is Cersei’s coronation. I love the lighting. The music. The crown. Lena’s dead eyes. “The Winds of Winter” was such a huge episode for Cersei, and this scene tied it up perfectly. She finally got all that she yearned for – at the cost of everything she loved. It’s so complex, and Lena and Nikolaj were able to say so much with mere expressions.

[SPOILERS] An∞ Bran theory,"I realize any theory relating to magic in the show are often seen as tin foil, in that case this is very tin foil. 

The TLDR summary is this: the Three Eyed Raven is Bran's mind trapped in a time loop, his mind stored in the weirwood trees and passed on through the years in host Greenseers until he merges with his younger self through Bloodraven and becomes the infinite Bran, goes back in time to the Long Night to stop the NK, fails then has to wait centuries to do it all again.

Those with *time* to kill...proceed...

First, a word on GoT ""time travel."" I think the Three Eyed Raven telling Bran the ink is dry was a warning but also a lesson that ""young Bran"" never seems to learn from infinite Bran, I think he is warning himself that no matter what he does, at this point, these events already happened. So if Bran does try to repeat the Hodor scenario but harness his powers to change history, it already happened and was reflected in the story we see so it will change nothing but in fact ensure events take place. So it's impossible for him to go back and ""kill the Night King"" because there would be no Night King at this point in the story if he had pulled it off. So ""time travel"" won't effect the story in some kind of Back to the Future way where he can come back to a changed present like Marty did when Biff got the sports almanac. 

Time travel is more a window to look through and Bran might just fall through it...he has bad luck with windows. 

So if there is a loop it might be similar to the Terminator, where Kyle Reese goes back in time to save John Connor who turns out to be the son he created by going back in time. So we don't know how the causal time loop started but because Kyle could go back, John sprung into existence because Kyle would go back.

Equating this to the Three Eyed Raven and Bran: The Three Eyed Raven I believe is Bran's mind, traveled back thousands of years and disconnected from his body, stored in the weirwood's and hosted by Greenseers that it could inhabit. He forged a strong alliance with the Children of the Forest in this time. 

Now there may be a question of how the Children are aligned with him but if he is a Greenseer and they love the trees it would be natural for them to gain each others trust, look into each others minds and come to the conclusion that neither is out to harm the other but protect their own kind. So I think in this way it might have been Bran that really ended the war, showing the Children of the Forest the future their Night King created and maybe resulting in the pact with man. The prequel series might even cover this since Bran could be going back to the time the show will cover.  

With Bran trapped he would have existed as the Three Eyed Raven and influenced mankind through the ages. I'm not saying Bran is the same Bran who built every structure like others theorize but he might have been around experiencing these things and becoming desensitized to the people of Westeros as he watched them make war on each other. 

The Three Eyed Raven we meet would be Bloodraven who has merged with Bran's mind, a Greenseer used as a host for the Three Eyed Raven. He has both memories of his own and infinite Bran. The Three Eyed Raven would have used his powers to guide his younger self to him, using the Reeds. Once young Bran met the Three Eyed Raven that carried infinite Bran inside of him it would be time to ""merge"" even though he ""wasn't ready"". 

""The time has come for you to become me."" When the Three Eyed Raven died, his mind passed into young Bran turning him into infinite Bran. He would have remembered being on the other side of this when he was young Bran and remembered not being ready. 

When young Bran saw the realization of his past, present and future all coming together it probably melted his brain a little resulting in the distant and robotic Bran that 'isn't really Bran anymore' (according to Meera). It is Bran however its just Bran who has seen this whole story an infinite amount of times and can't get off the ride no matter how many times he warns himself the ""ink isn't dry"".

This leaves a few questions:

Why did Bran go back in the first place? Likely to stop the Night King. Even though he was told ""the ink isn't dry"" Bloodraven with Infinite Bran inside of him warned him plenty, the younger Bran I think still has a major influence over the Infinite Bran and causes himself to make the same mistake over and over, go back to try and change something that can't be changed. 

(in my opinion more than Jon and Dany, the Night King clearly wants to kill Bran and the Three Eyed Raven and the Children of the Forest. He walked past Jon who was sunk in a lake and threw a spear past Dany but he came head on at Bran with everything he had, Bran was the goal not getting around Bran like Jon or getting something from him like Dany's dragons)

So why does the Night King want him dead? A Causal loop could be at play. It could be that it was Bran going back in time that somehow caused the NK to exist or helped defeat him in the past, the NK could be out for revenge on Bran and his infinite self for being born or beaten.

How could Bran's loop end? Young Bran is led by Jojen under the influence of his infinite self to a cave. He teaches and then downloads himself into younger Bran. This version of Bran would have infinite versions of Bran going back in time to the Long Night in his head. This Infinite Bran fights in the current war until he decides to go back (never learning his lesson that the ink is dry). He goes back and I would think his body is destroyed in the present. He is then back where he started, in the Long Night with the Children of the Forest and passing through host bodies of Greenseers for hundreds of years until his younger self is born and he can try again by merging with that Bran. 

I don't know if what we're watching would be the ""last loop"" and it will be broken or Bran will learn something new to stop the war once and for all or if its just another iteration. I won't give away spoilers to another massive epic book series but it used a similar device for its story. I do wonder if Bran does go back and there is a loop if it will feed into the spin off show that will take place during the long night. Any way props to Rick and Morty for putting the idea in my head...   ",gameofthrones,True,1531424739,2018-07-12

(Spoilers) Endgame Theory,"Going to get flamed for not having done enough research but regardless....

What if the “bittersweet ending” is the undoing of the universe we’ve grown to watch. GRRM has said the show takes a lot of historic influence, so what if the end for this show is the transition from Monarchy to Democracy. 

Through out the show, and especially in S7 we got a LOT of hints of this being the potential and logical end of the series. 

With the rise of the high sparrow we see the Power a popular figure can have. In S7 succession is also an enormous issue, especially when considering that at the moment at face value Danny can’t have an heir; so what does Tyrion suggest, he brings up the Iron Islands and Nights Watch has having their own methods of selecting a leader. Danny’s goal has always been to break the wheel, what better way than to replace it all together. 

Maybe the end is the common folk of Westeros are so fed up of the wars and the “game of thrones” and it’s impact on them the series end is the small folk rising up and removing all of the Kings and Queens on the board.  ",gameofthrones,True,1531425200,2018-07-12

"[SPOILERS] I'm still mad that Jerome Flynn and Lena Headey can't get along, because it ruins such great plot potential","As we all know, Flynn and Headey dated many years ago, and it ended so badly that they have a clause in their contracts stating they won't work together (hence some of the awkward scene exits, especially Bronn leaving the Dragon Pit). However, if they could've got past their bad blood, I think we could've seen a really incredible plot in the final season.
Consider that right before Jamie's departure, Jamie was the last truly competent general Cersei had left, and Bronn was Jamie's right hand man. Though the show never explicitly states it, it appears that Bronn holds some kind of high rank in the Lannister army at this point, as he can be seen giving commands, and only takes orders from Jamie himself. Let's say Bronn doesn't awkwardly exit the Dragon Pit, but instead stays put on the Lannister's side. This would make sense, as Bronn is still anticipating the Lannisters will be able to offer him the greatest reward for his efforts, regardless of the outcome of the inevitable war. Instead of leaving with Podrick, which implies Bronn may be heading north with the rest of our ""good guy"" gang, Bronn would likely head back to the Red Keep with Cersei and Co. Now, exit Jamie, who at no point is shown communicating his plans to Bronn and seems to leave King's Landing alone and in a rush. 
Our assumption from the final episode is that Bronn is also headed north, and because of their contractual obligations, it will only make sense for Flynn to join the North cast. However, ignoring the contracts, here's what I think could've happened, and I would have loved to see it:
Jamie leaves, and Cersei, while waiting for Euron to return with the Golden Company, needs a resourceful commander to lead her armies. Bronn, seeing an opportunity to double his bets, goes to Cersei and informs her that as a proven warrior, as Jamie's right hand man (literally), and as an old consort of Tyrion, Bronn is in the best position to both command her troops and completely anticipate, counter, and destroy her brothers' forces. He would work excellently alongside the Golden Company, as he is a Westerosi mercenary same as many of them. 
I know a lot of the counter-argument here would be that Bronn cares for Jamie and Tyrion, but he has shown us that he is more about himself than anyone else. If the show could set it up right, having Bronn as the new face of evil in the final season would be both gut-wrenching and extremely satisfying. Just imaging Bronn maiming or killing any of the heroes, and how much it would shake things up for those final few episodes. Plus, if we want to entertain the very fun theory that [Bronn is the last of House Reyne](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6tflas/everything_theory_what_if_bronn_is_the_last_reyne/), then it would be even more satisfying seeing him counter the Lannisters' moves on both sides, and completely destroy the characters we've seen him get to know over the years. 
Just a thought, but I really enjoy the potential. At the end of the day, we all love Bronn, and although he should've died several times at this point, watching him turn from the loveable sidekick to the greatest adversary Jamie and Tyrion have to face would be fantastic, and more in the spirit of the true twists the early seasons had to offer.",gameofthrones,True,1531440885,2018-07-12

[Spoilers] 3rd rewatch question,"Im on my third rewatch and currently on S4 E8 The mountain and the viper. I hit the part in the episode where Jaime and Tyrion are in the cell before the big fight and there is a big monologue about a cousin Orsin (guessing on the spelling) and his beetle smashing. I guess i just dont understand the significance of the story and would like to be filled in on what i missed. i figure it should be important because of how long the dialog between the two of them lasted. My first two watch throughs, I kind of chalked it up to the nervous incoherent ramblings of a man who very well may day later in the day, but that never quite sat right with me. To me it just kind of all seem pointless, and the whole thing just ends in a question. They never really explained any of it

Anyways, hopefully someone can help shed some light on the situation for me and what im missing. Thanks in advance. Also just an FYI, ive seen every episode so no need to tip toe around anything.",gameofthrones,True,1531445270,2018-07-12

[SPOILERS] Dorne and the Lannisters?,"So, as far as I can tell, Ellaria wanted to murder Myrcella because that would make the Lannisters declare war so Dorne would have to get involved and Doran refused to do anything.

But, she did, and the Lannisters did not retaliate in anyway. I’m wondering why this is, because it makes Ellaria look like a fucking idiot until Varys comes to her and they make a deal.

Why didn’t the Lannisters retaliate (High Sparrow??)...? They just kind of shrugged it off and then Jaime mentioned it once at a council meeting.

I guess this is just one of those things that separates the beginning seasons and the latter. At the beginning of the show, if this event happened it would be huge news and be very important to the store. But in the newer seasons an important character could be offed like that and no one really cares. Idk.

[SPOILERS] - CLEGANEBOWL - Hype Train Diversion,"Not to be a dick or to wreck the hype train. But in response the The Mountain saying that his favourite scene to film in in S8 I want to try and work out some logistics. Now S8 is going to be amazing we all hope and the scenes for a lot of the actors are bound to be some of their favourite they will ever do. Easily the Mountain could be talking about the first time he gets to have a big battle scene or it could be Cleganebowl. My question is how on Earth does Cleganebowl play out from where we are now: 

* Who is on trial? Obviously the Mountain will represent Cersei. 

* If it's Cersei then how would she ever end up needing to choose trial by combat for her life

* If not Cersei then how was this character captured? Who would the Hound want to fight for? 

* Is there time for all this to be played out with the WW coming? Will it be after they are defeated? 

* What will be the aftermath of the Trial (if it's a trial) will Cersei agree to death, will she agree to exonerate the character in question if the Hound wins? She isn't exactly a champion of the faith I can't see her allowing trial by combat. 

* Will it just be in open battle? What battle? Who vs Who? Where?

I am just starting research and planning for my dissertation on Classical Reception in Game of Thrones and am asking a favour of you. 
Classical Reception can most simply be described as how Classics (the study of Ancient Greece and Rome) is received today. My aim is to prove that GRRM and Benioff and Weiss were greatly inspired by Classics for the show. 
Some example of this that I have discovered:
•Jon Snow’s assassination and Julius Caesar’s
•The character of Joffrey and the Emperor Caligula
• Stannis’ sacrifice of Shireen and Agamemnon’s of Iphigenia
I am asking any of you if you can think of any other specific examples.

[SPOILERS] The absolute best Tyrion moment,"*Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated. Gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.*

*You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears. If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goat shit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice.* 

*When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry! Into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. Once I brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel...*

That scene was hilarious, you can't tell me otherwise, I won't hear it.

As a bonus one:

Slaver: Dwarfs' cocks have magic powers
Tyrion: You can't hand out a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it! He has to know it came from a dwarf, and how could he know unless he sees the dwarf

Also could it be a trial by combat with Arya fighting whoever Jaime elects as his champion? Personally I think the stark sisters will want to take vengeance on Jaime but ultimately I think Jon, Bran, and maybe even Tyrion will shut it down. Because while Jon will want to punish Jaime, Jon knows that there is no time to be in conflict as the true threat is coming.

Let's say Tyrion was standing closer to where Sansa was. Do you think that he would have escaped to safety with her and Dontos, or do you think he would have stayed because he didn't want to leave his family, despite being hated by most of them? Things would have been very different for Sansa if he went with her, but i doubt he would have been too keen on going to the Vale after what he went through the last time he was there.

So, to summarize, how do you think things would have played out if Tyrion was standing next to Sansa at the moment of Joffrey's death?",gameofthrones,True,1531504783,2018-07-13

[SPOILERS]Does anybody feel like the ending of Season 7 episode 6 was just lazy writing to buff the Whitewalkers?,"Talking about giving the Night King Viserion of course. Before that I've always kind of struggled to believe that the army of the dead posed any threat to Westeros whatsoever. The Whitewalkers have won every fight in the show because they're fighting tired and meager forces usually caught completely off guard. What exactly was going to happen once they inevitably breached the wall? Sure Castle Black might fall, but once that happens, all of Westeros knows something is up. What were they going to expect to accomplish against a real army in the open fields south of the wall?

Jon's forces alone realistically could have dealt with the Army of the Dead with ease. Cavalry would easily outmaneuver the wights and force them into unfavourable positions and over time whittle them down with minimal losses. There would be no surprise attacks, once Jon knows where they were, the Whitewalkers were never going to lose them. Also there's a reason why the wights move so slowly while not in combat instead of at least jogging to their next destination. We see they're vulnerable to wear and tear, if they were to be running long term like eternally charging after soldiers on friggin' horses, they would get severely damaged just from trying to keep up. A broken ankle is a broken ankle, it doesn't matter if you're living or dead, you can't move with that.

Only now with the dragon factoring in do I think they're posing a threat. Even then it's not going to take a genius to figure out they need to build a big freaking scorpion to take it down.

[SPOILERS]Alternate Timelines,"I started re-watching season Game of Thrones Season 3 last Sunday and watching the aftermath of the Battle of the Blackwater really got me thinking...

What if Melisandre (The Red Woman) HAD accompanied Stannis' army/navy in the Assault on King's Landing?  Could Melisandre really have tamed the Wildfire attack from Tyrion, thus enabling Stannis and his overwhelming force to easily assault and capture King's Landing.  Tyrion, Cersie, Joffery and all the other high enemies of Stannis would be captured and/or killed, Sansa would potentially be freed AND word could have gotten quickly to Robb potentially saving him soon to be murder.
However, Tyrion would no longer be able to meet with Daenerys and that could potenially at worst get our Dragon Queen killed, or at best delay her travel/assault on the 7 Kingdoms.  I don't even think I could begin to predict what this could do/affect to the White Walkers up North.

Or what if Melisandre went to the Battle of the Blackwater and FAILED to tame the Wildfire attack and end up losing her life?  Melisandre would then no longer have taken Gentry away from the Brotherhood without Banners, and Arya could possibly never become a faceless man?  Melisandre would also not be alive to heal/revive Jon Snow OR to burn Shireen or more! (like maybe that crazy king's blood magic that killed people?!?!

"[SPOILERS] Season 8 Questions, thoughts and theories.","Hey all. As my personal life is in a shambles right now, which is the lightest way I can think to describe things, I've been getting sucked into the GOT Youtube rabbit hole as a friendly distraction.

From that I keep hearing similar sentiments across the board on Season 8, plus some interesting ideas. I'd love to share my own thoughts on the grandest of all finale seasons, probably in the history of TV, and get your feedback. This may be long...

Gendry/Arya
I keep hearing a lot about the possible love connection of Gendry and Arya and I hate it!! Aryas destiny was never to settle down and be a wife. However, that is something Sansa wanted. Sansa also wanted to marry King Roberts son to becomes Queen. So what if in S08 we have the lovely reunion of Gendry and Arya but Arya introduces Gendry to Sansa, a knowing smile on her face as Gendry is blown away by Sansa. The two hit it off and finally Sansa finds herself with a decent guy and once he is made legit by Jon, Gendry is in line for the throne with his wife Sansa.

And so Cersi's prophecy of a younger, more beautiful Queen taking her crown comes true.

Ayra's End Game
While I know there is always a chance Arya could die in the final season which would be devestating if she didn't I always thought she would go off and travel like she said she wanted to. And while I still like that idea I did hear a youtuber recently mention how cool it would be to see Arya as Queens/Kings guard. With Sansa on the throne, this could happen.

The Hound/Sansa
I have read speculation of some theory the hound and Sansa will get together. I fucking hate it. But I do like the idea that in Season 8 Sansa will Knight the hound.

Bran/3ER
When I was looking back at scenes with Bran with the 3ER I noticed skulls and remains on the floor around the 3ER. Now, unless I imagined that it made me think who did those belong to. And then I thought, what if the 3ER was actually planning to level up Bran to ultimately take his life force so he could keep going? But Bran messed up when the NK got him and the shell/body of the 3ER was destroyed so now Bran is simply the shell/new younger body of the 3ER?

Melisnadre/Bran/Arya
So Mel worships the LOL and all the followers have been burning remnants of the old gods. Well, isn't Bran now technically an ""old god"". Mel has a history of burning kids and Bran can't exactly run away from her. Do you think Mel might try and sacrifice Bran in order to destroy the NK, doing what she thinks needs to be done and is this how/why Arya could end up killing her?

Jon/Daenarys
I know everyone is convinced Jon and Dany will have a baby but I hate that theory and I like to believe all the build up of suggesting it was a red herring. Aside from that I don't see the last season, of at least the main portion of it, spanning enough months to show the audience she is with child. 

Prophecy
So everyone is obviously all about the Azor Ahai/Prince(ss) who was promised prophecy and are hooked on the Nessa Nessa Lightbringer idea. I think a lot of what I know of the show/books (haven't read them but I've watched a lot about the world of ASOIAF) seems to hold a mirror up to more modern society ideas including religion. I don't think there ever really was a prophet. 
Every religion has their version of a Saviour and I think all religions in GOT have the same thing. This story of a Saviour that's bent and twisted to suit their agenda but I think it might be little more than just a tale that grew wings over time and all the extra flourishes to that take vary depending on who you align with.

Would this not be an epic teaser?
So on a long drive I started thinking about how great it would be to get some kind of trailer for the new season. And then I thought how epic it would be to show blue darkness and loads of snow. A distorted voice over plays of Sansa from S07 saying the whole ""lone wolf dies..."" Line again but as she says it a pair of red eyes open in the darkness and Ghost starts to step into view. ""But the pack survives..."" More eyes start to open in the darkness around him and then another large dire wolf (Nymeria) steps up beside him. Loads of menacing growls cut to black.

Could you imagine a fan reaction if something like that played out in a theatre?!?!

Anyway would love to hear your thoughts on my own.

[SPOILERS] Finally finished watching Season 2 and the last two episodes were just breathtaking!,"I‘m currently binge watching GoT and worked my way through the first and second season in a week. 
I thought that over all the second season had a nice built up for the last two episodes, but out of the 8 episodes I actually can‘t remember loving any episode that much. 
But the last two episodes were just phenomenal. The battle between Stannis &amp; Tyrion was one of the best battles put to screen. I thought it was very similar to LOTR The Two Tower‘s Battle of Helms Deep (though it doesn‘t compare to that one, since that one is the single greatest battle scene in cinema history).

The season finale wasn‘t as spectacular as episode 9, but it was really character driven with a lot of important plot points and decisions. 
Finally Daenerys is stepping forward, finally we get to see the White Walkers and finally a bit more Jon Snow.

I have never felt the desire to start the next season as much as in GoT.

Over all I think Season 2 is as good as Season 1. S1 was way more consistent than S2 but the highs in S2 are much higher than in S1.
It was a strong season, not without flaws and probably a great 7.5/10

And I really hope this is just the beginning. So hyped for Season 3!

[SPOILERS] why i dislike daenerys,"so i decided to share this long ass opinion on dany (cause ppl usually think at first that i like her for some reason). if you actually read everything ty ig (also i'm kinda scared how this is gonna turn out, i have no clue how reddit really works)


so seasons 1,2 and 4 daenerys get a pass because she was ok in these seasons ig, even though i really liked her character only in season 1.

season 1 dany was very much her being her brother’s sister. she did as he told, and through being married to drogo became exposed to more brutal, powerful side of life. it was through this new power that she was able to stand up to viserys, kill the witch that killed her unborn child and fucked with drogo,and inspired her to take charge in travelling to westeros and taking the iron throne.

season 2 built upon this nicely, her whole travelling to qarth, trying to find ships etc. like season 1 she was engaging because she had real troubles to deal with.

then season 3 came along. this was the first instance of the writers pushing a dany agenda too strongly down the audience’s throats. she became a lot less compelling this season because instead of real hardships and challenges, she just got whatever she wanted whenever she wanted. her taking of the unsullied army was ridiculously cheesy and unrealistic, i’m supposed to believe that killing the guy in charge is all it takes to acquire this huge ass army, and his murder was completely justified? i’m supposed to believe just saying “you’re all free,but you can fight for me if you want” is all it takes to get the entire army to fight for her truly with passion? it felt like they were trying to make a perfect leader out of her by making her go on a liberation streak (which shouldn’t be the only thing a perfect ruler does obviously). what i didn’t like about this was that it was just her vs nameless bad guys. nothing compelling there,and no truth there too. good and bad on both sides, yet the scenes painted her as some perfect person. as if there are no ethical dilemmas with taking these cities. now granted, this didn’t bother me TOO much, this is more a criticism of how the filming and music was done in season 3 to try and paint her as some wholly good jesus-like figure. the worst part was the finale, her being held up by a bunch of former slaves whilst cheesy music plays way too much oh god. (was rewatching recently so it’s been really stuck in my head) that was the first of MANY cheesy scores to play during her scenes.

season 4 was actually a massive improvement, i’d go as far as saying i kinda liked watching her in season 4. the show finally introduced some moral dilemmas of her actions, her crucifying of the masters, drogon killing livestock and children, former slaves not liking the new life she’s forced them into, it was something compelling and interesting for a change. she made some mistakes, but she listened carefully to the advice of jorah and barristan, and managed to make the right decision regarding these matters. hizdahr was a good display of how the “bad guys” dany’s been up against aren’t all just bad guys. there was this great quote from jorah - “it’s tempting to see your enemies as evil,all of them. but there’s good and bad on both sides of every war ever fought.”
ending the season on her locking up the dragons away was nice, it showed her thinking like a ruler and it was an emotional moment. it was also through these experiences she decided to stay in meereen to improve herself as a ruler and a liberator.

season 5 comes along and shits all over this. i had high hopes that the sons of harpy would build upon her season 4 dilemmas in a way that would force her to become smarter about how she deals with people that don’t support her. jorah’s gone, and they kill off barristan too for some reason (well actually it’s d&amp;d’s fault, just won’t be getting into it). first thing she does in response? feeds masters to her dragons. that was a huge insult to everything barristan stood for,during the whole sons of the harpy situation he was the one pushing for fair trials, not impulsive murders. then this season she just changes as a character, she keeps having lame ass speeches like the “i’m going to break the wheel” which sounds kinda cool for the trailer, but barely carry any actual weight. and as though season 4 didn’t happen, she goes back to viewing all her enemies as evil. she now hates the masters again, and even worse she now starts to genuinely perceive herself to be an all perfect ruler. when tyrion comes into town, she seems shocked when tyrion even suggests that she may not be worth his service. i don’t know why, but for some reason emilia clarke decided to take an entirely different route with playing daenerys this season too. this season she just puts on this expressionless face for nearly all her scenes that aren’t deliberately trying to be emotional. detached me from her character a lot. she also became a lot more argumentative and irrational this season. then there’s this issue with drogon. i loved the fact that as her dragons grew she could no longer control them, that felt real. but then for some reason drogon flies in, saves her and flies off with her on his back. there was just no build up on this scene so it felt flat. (but ig they went for that “a pet will protect its owner when in danger”.)
and the whole trying-to-touch-his-nose thing all season was so lame too. but anyway, season 5 undid all her learnings from the previous season.

up next is season 6, i’m really hoping it’ll be a redemption for dany. being captured by dothraki, i’m hoping for a season 3 jaime-esque redemption arc, coz in season 5 she became very entitled. too entitled. i was hoping that being a captive would bring her back to reality,and remind her of her roots with the dothraki in season 1. the dothraki are after all a good facilitator of how there is good and bad on both sides. they were good for her in season 1, but bad to others. boi could i have been further from the truth. instead she’s entitled as ever, boasting about her titles to the khal [whatever his name was] in the most ridiculous scene ever.
then that scene where she burns the khals rolls around with her cringy speech. this is one of those areas that the show is deliberately not explaining. they need her to have a large army and needed to come up with some way to get her out of captivity so they killed two birds with one stone. but they know this can’t stand up to scrutiny so it doesn’t get any. once she simultaneously murdered all their leaders and desecrated their holy site all of the dothraki joined her.
like it’s that liberation of the unsullied army all over again. apparently dothraki follow strength so it’s fine ahhh i fucking hate that tho. and i’m supposed to be happy for her? fucking hell. (the biggest unanswered questions is where are the women, children, and non-fighting aged men? if dany brought them with her that makes no sense. it’s already nonsensical how she can provision her army, but if she has to feed an even larger amount of civilians as well it’s beyond absurd. but if she left the civilians in essos, then that means she managed to convince all the men to abandon their families to certain enslavement since they would be completely defenseless.)
so she finally gets back to meereen with her army, and how do we see dany deal with this threat to revolt in her city? she unleashes the dothraki horde to kill them all. real nice. and ofc there’s all happy music and d&amp;d are like “yeah be happy! isn’t this awesome? she’s solving the situation.”

but even tho season 5 had faults it at least acknowledged that the sons of the harpy couldn’t be dealt with just sheer violence. you can’t kill ideas, killing all those people shouldn’t have done shit, if anything it would’ve made things even worse. not to mention the dothraki are savages. but yet we’re supposed to watch that and think “wow isn’t dany great?”. bullshit, that wasn’t a thing a great ruler would do. she learned absolutely nothing from her time with the dothraki, and absolutely nothing more about ruling. and for some reason all the dragons that she had massive problems with are all perfectly tame now? they do exactly as she wants them to do because .. reasons? (i think i actually mentioned some cringy ass excuse somewhere in this rant already) perfect. it just felt like more and more shit getting handed to her because it’s convenient for the plot. but there’s nothing compelling about that. why would i want to watch the adventures of someone that just gets whatever they want with no consequences? a good example of the no consequences situation would also be the fact that they killed off tommen just so that danny wouldn’t have the moral dilemma of having to overthrow a child, d&amp;d will really do anything for her, won’t they? it pisses me off. i don’t want to watch her vs just bad guys. i used to be excited at the prospect of her travelling to westeros because i acknowledged it would be her versus other good people for a change, but the show just went and fucked all that didn’t it? guess they couldn’t risk dany looking bad in any sort of way. it’ll be the same with cersei if she does give birth to her new child. she’ll spare her or they’re just gonna have cersei miscarry the child.
so yeah for some reason at the end of the season 6 she’s like “i’m ready now, i’m totally a competent ruler now” yet she showed no evidence of having learned anything. if anything she became worse.

another thing to add to season 6 is that yeah of course the season ends on her getting greyjoy support, tyrell support and dornish support. as if she wasn’t overpowered enough already. i seriously don’t understand why they think we wanna see some overpowered person just get the support they need easy peasy. no controversy? the closest we got to controversy tbf was randyll and dickon’s death in season 7. i liked that they put tyrion and dany on the spot.

season 7 rocks about and she’s now pushing this narrative that she’s taking the 7 kingdoms because she wants to help the people. are you fucking kidding me? if you cared about people you’d have stayed in essos and ensured slavery actually ended. you wanna fight oppression? there’s your oppression. but i guess if she just admitted she was there to conquer it would make her look bad? well done d&amp;d. this season she’s just portrayed as the perfect person that believes everything she does is right and moral, when it isn’t. she justifies everything because she just thinks everyone that’s against her is evil. that annoys me. and to build onto to what i was saying about her in season 5, emilia clarke’s acting has just gone for some reason. like i believe she can act, but it’s like she chooses not to in these later seasons and it’s so frustrating to watch. or maybe it’s just d&amp;d’s fault, they’re giving her the instructions on how to portray her character (? man why am i trying to defend her). but yeah overall i just can’t stand d&amp;d trying to make everything super easy for her, painting everyone that’s against her as evil and her as always justified, her long cringey speeches, and her sense of entitlement. you didn’t see seasons 1-4 dany saying she’d take the 7 kingdoms in order to help the people i mean come on. she’s just lost all the compelling traits and it sucks. to be perfectly honest i just see her now as catfood for feminists. she’s supposedly perfect, she’s supposedly powerful, she talks some smack, and she makes speeches. all without the grit that makes a character interesting. yet somehow she gets shitload of screentime. oh right d&amp;d we get it, she’s yo fav.


i defo rambled on here, so sorry if that’s not really a coherent argument. it just annoys me how wrong they went with her arc after season 4 ended. like game of thrones wasn’t all about people just fighting bad guys and getting what they want. it was about real conflict where there are no easy choices. real conflict where your enemies aren’t just evil, and you have to question the morality of your own actions. real conflict usually for power. all of these themes have been stripped from dany’s story and it sucks dicks. they can’t even keep the power aspect since it’s now just her taking over the westeros to benefit the people of westeros.


i just thought of another reason, but for me daenerys’ story is the epitome of what i don’t like about what the show has become. lack of complexity,lack of scheming,generic good vs evil,lack of emotional moments,plot armour,lack of moral conflict,cheese/cliche tropes,forced quotable lines (i swear half her speeches are just so they can have cool sounding words to put in trailers),too much magic, too many ex machinas. these are all things i find popping up in her story more than anyone else’s, which ofc plays a big part of why i don’t like watching her character on the show. i do believe her story didn’t always suffer from these disadvantages,alas that is not the case anymore.

[SPOILERS] Jon and Sansa foreshadowing from the books.,"Sansa first love in the books was Waymar Royce, he was the youngest son of Lord Yohn Royce and was a ranger at the Nights Watch, when he visited Winterfell Sansa fell madly in love with him at first sight and wanted marry and have his babies. Waymar Royce is described to be tall, slender and graceful, dark haired and having beautiful grey eyes. Thats exactly how Jon Snow is described in the books, the only difference is that when Sansa fell in love with Waymar he was a young men of 19 and Jon at the time was just a boy of 14, by the time Sansa meet Jon again in the books he will be 18 or 19 and will look a lot like Waymar Royce, her first love. 
  

'

&gt;**He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife.** Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. 

- A Game of Thrones Prologue

&gt;**Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black**, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. **Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.**

More foreshadows:
 
 
&gt;He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn's own grandchildren for Winterfell. (AGOT Catelyn II).

Lady Catelyn celebrating Jon Snow going to the wall. I am pretty sure Jon Snow sons will be her grandchildren. Again, the first time I read this quote, it just screamed foreshadow for me.

&gt;“You,” Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, “will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.” Arya screwed up her face. **""No,"" she said, ""that's Sansa.""**

&gt;“Sweet one,” her father said gently, “listen to me. When you’re old enough, I will make you a match with a high lord who’s worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong. This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake. **That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.”** -

 (SANSA, AGoT)
 

&gt;She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, **for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard.** 

(SANSA, ACOK)
 
&gt;They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes. **“I’m Prince Aemon the Dragonknight,” Jon would call out,** and Robb would shout back, “Well, I’m Florian the Fool.” Or Robb would say, “I’m the Young Dragon,” and Jon would reply, **“I’m Ser Ryam Redwyne.”**

Notice how Sansa's heros match with with the ones Jon's used to pretend to be as a child.

&gt;“I’ve never lain with any woman but Cersei. In my own way, I’ve been truer than your Ned ever was. Poor old dead Ned. So who has shit for honor now, I ask you? **What was the name of that bastard he fathered?”** Catelyn took a step backwards. “Brienne.”

&gt;**“No, that wasn’t it.”** Jaime Lannister upended the flagon. A trickled ran down onto his face, bright as blood. **“Snow, that was the one. Such a white name … like the pretty cloaks they give us in the Kingsguard when we swear our pretty oaths.”**

A Clash of Kings - Catelyn VII

&gt;When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. She found his cloak on the floor, twisted up tight, **the white wool stained with blood and fire.** The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. **She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.**

&gt;“Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head. But a voice inside her whispered, **There are no heroes…”**

&gt;“I will not hang him,” said Jon. “Bring him here.” “Oh, Seven save us,” he heard Bowen Marsh cry out. The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. **Until Jon said, “Edd, fetch me a block,” and unsheathed Longclaw.”**

Jon - ASoS

 &gt;In Sansa’s dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. Sometimes there was even a girlwho looked like Arya.”

Arya is the only sibling that looks like Jon Snow. How interesting.

When Sansa was in the Vale and her aunt Lysa was trying to push the idea of her marrying her son, the sick Robin Arryn, of course she knows that Lysa doesnt care about her, and only wants Winterfell. In the end of that chapter, where she is receiving a marriage proposal to marry her COUSIN, she laments:
 
""Its not me she wants, its my claim, No one will ever marry me for love"" (Sansa, ASOS)

As I have been telling you for the past years, those two will marry for love in season 8.

I dont think the color matches, it looks like there is a lot of brown around his pupil at 3:55 but at 56:24 they are pure grey. Also at 3:55 there is some pigment dispersion at about the 5 o'clock position on his iris and his sclera is really veiny (which makes sense for someone that has been stressed out in a dungeon). At 56:24 his eyes are perfectly white, as if that person was not stressed out at all over the last couple days.

[SPOILERS] The Night King Question,"I'll try make this brief, it's something that popped into my head when I was commenting elsewhere. 

Is it possible for the NK to be a Targaryan?

Here's why I ask. The NK took down 1 Dragon with ample opportunity to take down more. Now if the NK saw Dany as a threat couldn't he have taken her out easily? Also, if he saw Jon Snow as a threat, didn't he have ample opportunities to take him out too? Even when Jon fell through the ice there was no effort made to kill him.

Now let's say the NK was Targaryan related somehow and actually believed in the ""Dragon has 3 heads"" prophecy. Could that be why he took 1 Dragon for himself and has never gone out of his way to destroy the other 2, Jon or Dany when given the chance. 

Is there anyway that his onslaught has been a result of not only the dragons coming back but also knowledge of Dany and Jon. Is it possible that the reason he wanted to stop Bran / the 3ER was to stop them realising/telling Jon who he really is.

Given the prophet/hero Azor Ahai is this figure that exists in the lore of every religion in some way (e.g The last hero) is it possible the NK also believes that he/his people have a promised one who is destined to save/be the hero for his kind? And maybe his aim is to infiltrate Jon's mind in some way before Bran has a chance to...

[SPOILERS] What if Lightbringer is...,"What if Lightbringer actually already appeared in the show, a sword of legends, used to be Ice, Ned Starks greatsword which gradually lost its magic appearance (glowing and radiating heat) over the centuries.

As far as I know lightbringer was used in the age of heroes to defeat the long night, what if that sword survived, and was kept in the stark family.

Now the big fallacy in this theory is that Valyrian Steel swords were introduced by, well the Valyrians who invaded Westeros a long time after the long night.

But what if Ice wasn't lightbringer until combined with Dragon Fire and maybe dragon glass to become Lightbringer, in which sense it would literally be a story of Ice and Fire. Now that Ice has been melted and is now in the form of 2 swords, one wielded by Brienne and I believe the other wielded by Jaime. This would help support the 2 ""prince that was promised "" theories.

Although this point might be a bit farfetched swordmaking has sometimes been describing as making a blade sing, which would be interesting to see that Ice was a song of Ice and Fire, Ice the blade and fire (dragonfire and dragonglass).",gameofthrones,True,1531619261,2018-07-14
[SPOILERS] Season 7 discussion,"Hi, I've just finished my 5th or 6th watch of every season. Since the first time I've watched it, I felt like season 7 doesn't make much sense and the plots are a little bit stupid. 

The whole Daenerys vs Cercei war is fine, but I think the meeting does not make any sense. Why would Tyrion and Daenerys even think of trusting Cercei? It seems so obvious that whatever Cercei would say, you couldn't trust it. Based on this assesment, what is the point of this meeting? And considering that, there's no way going beyond the wall is worth it, because ""showing it"" to Cercei is absolutely pointless.

GRRM is a genius,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1531629675,2018-07-15
[NO SPOILERS] GRRM is an evil genius,"So I’ve had this thought ever since finishing A Dance with Dragons (7 years ago?), and seeing how insanely popular this series has gotten despite the fact that we haven’t seen a new book since and that thought is repeatedly delayed indefinitely.   I’m pretty sure this is exactly GRRM’s diabolical plan though:

Step 1:  Establish a dense and intricate foundation without any definitive direction.  Enough to get people hooked, but not enough to reveal anything that would jeopardize giving too much away.  

Step 2:  Start over with a movie/TV series to reignite interest and capture a wider pop culture base.  

Step 3:  Now that there’s sufficient intrigue, let the fans speculate wildly.  All the while keeping a close ear to the fan sites and message boards.  

Step 4:  Cherry pick the best fan theories to incorporate into future material.  This serves two purposes.  First, it injects new material that the author himself may not have been thinking due to his own preconceptions.  Second, it gives the fans a sense of fulfillment by seeing their predictions come true.  Essentially it’s a choose your own adventure over a larger scale. 

Step 5:  Finish the series in the movie/TV format first so that you can subsequently release the remaining books, effective prolonging the gravy train even longer.  

Step 6:  Profit?

I’m sure I’m not the first to come to this realization, but it really makes you think about how the story has unfolded and just how much of this was preconceived vs written in to meet fan demand.

[no spoilers] forget about season 8 leaks and self-destructing scripts...,"They're doing it wrong. Forget shooting multiple fakeout scenes and self-destructing scripts. 

What they really need to do is shoot some relatively inexpensive scenes that satisfy some fan theories but aren't ever going to be canon, couldn't possibly be canon, then accidentally leak them to the public. It'll cause so much of a firestorm, anything actual that leaks won't be trusted, either. Because the fakeout scenes they're doing are likely plausible for the point we're at in the story rather than being absolutely nuts. 

They should bring back Fairley and shoot some Lady Stoneheart scenes from the book, leak it out and then get a nice, tall glass of iced tea and wait for the outrage when the episodes actually drop and those scenes ain't in any of 'em. 

Leak a scene where Jamie kills Bronn because he's thinking he's making a move romantically on Cersei. 

Hell, bring back Sean Bean for some current-day Ned scenes with zero explanation for how he's not dead. Make it clear this is not a flashback. Let that leak and let the fan speculation run wild. 

I mean, none of this could be more expensive than what they're already doing to fake people out. ",gameofthrones,True,1531637820,2018-07-15

"[SPOILERS] Just finished binging the show for the first time, planning to go out and buy all the books after work tomorrow.","I can’t believe I haven’t seen this show before, I’m blown away by how good it is, and also disappointed I went through it so fast (couldn’t stop watching).

I’m planning to buy the books tomorrow and start on those to tide me over until season 8, hopefully they’ll still be good even though I know most of what’s going to happen already.

Also, in the opening scene of season 7 episode 7, where were Jaime/bron/the Lannister army that the unsullied/Dothraki were forming up outside of a fortress? I thought the unsullied were in castely rock, and Jaime/bron were in Kings Landing the rest of that episode?",gameofthrones,True,1531700740,2018-07-15
Will the army of the dead save the plot in season 8?,"Im going to be honest, im not one of those Game of Thrones experts. However as a fan I wasnt thrilled with Season 7 of the story. It was at best mediocre in my opinion in comparison the previous seasons and storylines. Now I cant help but see theres Team Winterfell, Team Daenerys, Team Cersei and team Night king. However the story's black and white. Fire and ice. Good and bad. I struggle to see the grey, the water, neutral caught in between. And the main conflict in the story? A non talking ice man, who turns babies into weaker versions of himself and raises zombies.

Although ""hardhome"" was terrifying to watch, I didnt really care in ""Beyond the Wall"". I knew Jon, Gendry, Jorah, Berric and Hound wouldnt die. Plot armour. U want zombies to actually matter? BOOM wight ice dragon (that breaths fire? Wights main weakness) but its okay. Viserion wasnt even named till season 7, and Tyrion got a scene mostly focused on Rhaegal so Viserion got his moment. Before the end. 

I dont feel any attachment to these undead, only the NK and viserion(not as much as jon, dany or cersei). We are goin to see an army, of non scentiet dead people die....theyve no names. I give them all as much thought as the wildings that died in S7 e6.  Remember them? Tripped on ice and ripped to pieces by the horde..... with on guts splatter......so original for zombies. So really its emotional the fight to kill the Nk and viserion.
 
Of course itll be amazing. Drogon and Rhaegal v A dragon that wont feel pain and will not stop till they tear him to shreds, or he takes dem or dany with him. Still hoping tyrion is who rhaegal chooses After the pyramid. Maybe they even manage to throw or force him into a weirwood tree and he deactivates. Or mad queen cersei blows up Kings Landing but drogon and rhaegal break his wings off and he plummets into the Wildfire(dragging a brother and rider with him?). Im a sucker for dragons because of the AMAZING cgi.

Then NK v Jon. Maybe Arya, Jamie,Brienne and sam too. Because the valyrian steel. I dont hate the night king. To me, hes a just, there. He watches the wights kill all. All hes done is turn a baby, kill bloodraven, viserion and broke the wall into chunks. Compare this list to Cersei's deeds. Now jofferey. The Waif. And even daenerys. These are grey characters(i count the waif because we dont even know her  name, origin or motivations) the Nk. He kills and raises the dead. Emphasise on raise the dead. 

If hes the focus of season 8 (as many theorise)what will he do? Fly around, not speak and just mockingly raise his hands.  If i wanted this id watch Walking dead. Yes theres a zombie dragon and giants......its just drogon v lannisters in reverse and Wun Wun's fights again.  I just know cersei can up the stakes so much more. Hell daenerys could decide to DRACARYS everyone. i hope this long wait is a pay off. Can any explain to me why the dead are getting so much focus other than ""writers want money and zombie dragons sell"" or the 7 kingdoms arnt united?

I heard it means that the person who is wielding the title is the commander of 1/4th of the 7 Kingdom's army. But this doesn't make sense, because the 7k doesn't have a standing army, it just has a feudalistic vassal system where your army size is determined by your vassals, which leads to unequal army sizes (Tyrell with 80k, compared to 30-40k for most of the other kingdoms).

[SPOILERS] Warden of the South,"Not sure if this has been mentioned before, but when rewatching Season 7 Episode 2, I noticed something pretty interesting. I know that the show runners have a knack for foreshadowing by strategically placing scenes next to each other. (Like the Bran telling the story of the rat cook then cutting to Walden Frey eating). Well, when Jamie is convincing Randyll Tarley to fight with the Lannisters, he says “When the war is won, Cercei will need a new Warden of the South. I can think of no better man than yourself.” And the immediate next scene is a cut to Sam Tarley’s face. I think this, along with the fact that Sam has Heartsbane (the Tarly ancestral Valyrian steel sword), is some pretty convincing evidence that when all is said and done, Sam is going to be the Warden of the South. It also may be a reward for his service to the Seven Kingdoms (discovering the dragon stone, annulment, and anything else he will do before the finale).

[Spoilers] Just Finished Reading Book 1 GoT Thoughts,"I just finished reading the first book. It's excellent and it's basically  the first season of the show. The main differences I've noticed are in  the dream sequences which are amazing and the battles that occur at  River Run and Whispering Wood. I'm guessing the show simply didn't have  the budget for it but they were really intense fights. But while the  overall differences were small, often times small things in this story  can be of great importance later on.

A lot of things just beg for  answers I don't have.

The difference in the Night's Watch vow between  the books and show is rather telling. ""I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.""  

Dany's memory of a house with a big red door and a  lemon tree is also interesting. I heard a theory once that said this is proof that Dany isn't who she thinks she is. She's a princess of Dorne. The big red door is something you find in the water gardens and the palace there. Lemons can only be found in part of Westeros:  Dorne. I don't buy it but it's interesting.

The vision Dany sees of a great wolf and a man wreathed in  flame when she's carried into Khal Drogo's tent when the witch, Mirri  Maz Duur, performs the ritual that kills Dany's unborn son but saves  Drogo's life stuck in my head the moment I read it. Now the man wreathed in flame, sounds like a depiction of the Lord of Light. I don't know who or what the wolf refers to. 

The absence of Jeor Mormont's crow in the show now bothers me. ""Corn, corn, corn.""  ""Don't listen to his lies, I just fed him."" This one will be interesting in future books for sure. 

The difference  between ravens and crows as it pertains to the Great Other. I've heard this theory before and holy shit, there's something to this one. In the book it talks about the two as brothers but it definitely assigns a strong negative connotation to crows. They seem to tie in with the presence of evil. Even in Bran's falling dream it's a three eyed crow, not a raven. And it's not his friend either. It tries to kill him when Bran succeeds in flying. 

Why Hodor didn't want to go into the Winterfell crypts  and what was waiting for Bran down there ties into the idea of the crow as the enemy and even a stand in the for the Great Other. The crypts of Winterfell themselves are much more interesting and potentially ominous in the books. 

 Cersei's speculates to Ned that Jon was the son of Ned and  Ashara Dayne before delivering the infamous line:  ""when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.""

Dany's promise to Ser Jorah for a valyrian steel sword  before she stepped onto Drogo's funeral pyre. 

It's all fascinating stuff. Anyway, on to book two.",gameofthrones,True,1531801434,2018-07-17

[SPOILERS] Why I think season 7 isn't as bad as a lot of people claim,"Game of Thrones is a show that has originally won me over with the intricate political schemes, compelling characters and amazing developments. Season 7 did indeed fall short on all of those, but once the hype of the season died down and I rewatched the entire show from the beginning, I came to appreciate season 7 for what it is.

GOT is one of those shows that simply can't be separated by seasons. It's a whole and you have to watch every episode for all of it to make sense. The characters have been growing since the start of the first season, some have grown into better people, and some haven't, and that's fine. We know what their motivations are, we know what most of them want at this point and the story is coming to its end, which is why I think this season has largely been a 'calm before storm' moment of the show.

Was this season action packed? Yes, it most definitely was. And there were moments which might seem as far away from calm as possible, but looking at the season as a whole, it seems to me it's nothing more but an intro into the end of the show.

We have been with most of these characters for 7 seasons, some a bit less, and we have gotten to know most of the major players well. The truth is, there really wasn't much character development in this season, nor were the political tones as good as before, but everything is coming to an end. Every major character's motives are clear at this point and most allegiances are well known. There was no need to delve into the politics any more. 

At the end of the day, season 7 is not perfect. But it's my opinion that it did a good thing with setting the stage for the end of the show.",gameofthrones,True,1531832414,2018-07-17
[SPOILERS] The Long night spinoff and Asshai,"What really caught my interest with the synopsis for Goldman's Age of heroes/Long night prequel was the "" mysteries of the east "" .

The main focus of the prequel will probably be on the COTF , White walkers and Starks , but the fact that they included the mysterious east in the synopsis makes me wonder if they plan on explore the far east .

Do you think  they'll use Asshai , Shadowlands and other areas of the far east in the prequel? ",gameofthrones,True,1531835559,2018-07-17

[SPOILERS] Just finished binge watching the entire series for the first time and have now just been visiting this sub.,"And the thing I’m most glad to see is that the majority of viewers share my opinion on story arc involving Arya and the Hound in that it’s one of the best story arcs in there is. I absolutely love those two together and I’m praying they’ll reunite to fight alongside one another in season 8. 

This is especially because  Sandor has undergone quite a bit of change from his previously merciless nature while maintaining his loveably pessimistic views and constant insults, and Arya has become quite the fearsome fighter herself. 

Season 4 is by far my favourite season with one of the big reasons being the development of their adventures together, culminating in the fight against Brienne which I thought was the best choreographed fight scene in the entire series. That moment where Sandor grabs Brienne’s blade with his bare hands...heart out of my chest. ",gameofthrones,True,1531849544,2018-07-17

Running in zig zag wouldn't have done any difference, because Ramsay can always kill him in the last second of hope when Rickon almost reach Jon.",gameofthrones,True,1531855024,2018-07-17

2) Bran somehow turns out to be the Night King.  

3). Sansa broods atop the Winterfell wall and nothing else.

4)  Arya keeps killing people, stealing their faces and uses them to kill more people

5) Cersei has the baby.

6). Brienne dies a virgin (this poor woman deserves some sex!)

7) Tyrion ends up woman-less and alone

8) Jaime dies in the arms of the woman he loves.  (This was just foreshadowed to death ... extra vomit if it’s Cersei’s arms)

9) More supersonic ravens slicing through blizzards to instantly deliver mail

[SPOILERS] Nothing left to fight for.,"The threat the White Walkers pose, in both book and show, is world ending. If they are not stopped, Westeros, Essos, Sothyros, all of it will be consumed by endless winter, a tragedy of epic proportions as humanity is snuffed from existence. Yet, when it comes to the TV show, I can't bring myself to care. After thinking about this long and hard, I realized that the reason I don't care is because show Westeros has no future. 

Myrcella is dead. Tommen and Margeary are dead. Olly is dead. Rickon is dead. Arya is a crazy person, Bran has become the three eyed raven and no longer takes an active part in the story save as a plot device. The children, the next generation, everyone that was growing up in this world and would one day take the torch from the main caste, is gone. House Tyrell, House Martell, House Baratheon, and House Arryn are all effectively extinct, with Houses Greyjoy, Tully, and Lannister limping along on their last legs. The Brotherhood Without Banners is effectively gone, any hope of the liberty they dreamed of dead. So many of the characters people cared about are dead, so many recognizable facets of the worldbuilding erased or forgotten. Smallfolk can't even mind their own business and build a sept without bands of marauders butchering them all for no reason except to show how grim and dark the world is. Show Westeros is a dull grey land of misery. What do the people living in this world have to look forward to if Daenerys beats back the White Walkers? Extinction would be a mercy.

So a couple months ago I've uploaded some illustrations of the various, more fantastical creatures in the series in a field guide bestiary type thing; http://www.kevincatalan.com/#/beasts-of-ice-and-fire/ It's mainly been a personal project for myself and in honor of one of my favorite series. And maybe to one day be picked up by a publisher for an official book or something ;)

But after doing more and more research I found out there are a lot of really cool and barely mention critters that I would love to take a jab at but wanted to also get suggestions from the community on possible directions to take designs in. For example, the various ape species described from Essos and Sothoryos; what kind of ideas do you guys have about what they could look like or behave for me to illustrate? I'd love to discuss ideas cause I'm sure there are people out there that know a lot more than me and I really wanna do Martin's creatures justice. And of course I'll share my illustrations as I make them!

Hope this post is alright to post here and I just wanted a place to discuss the fauna of this world. Any other resources would be greatly appreciated! (and yeah I have the World of Ice and Fire book. it's been my biggest inspiration.)",gameofthrones,True,1530608262,2018-07-03

[SPOILERS] A question about water and symbolism,"I was just musing about the fact that there seems to be a running theme of people being saved from the water / drowning and wondered if these were deliberate parallels, symbolic or just something that seemed to happen quite a bit.

The first two that came to mind were Jon lost beneath the ice and left for dead only to then re-emerge, and Jaime plunged into a surprisingly deep river and saved by Bronn, but thinking about it there's also the Onion Knight after the Battle of the Blackwater, two Greyjoys deliberately drowned and then resuscitated in the Iron Islands, Arya controversially taking a dive into the canal after getting stabbed, Tyrion rescued from seemingly certain drowning by Ser Jorah in the fight with the stonemen and (books only) Lady Stoneheart who was thrown in the river after being killed and pulled out and brought back to life.

You could even throw in Gendry who disappeared for years at sea only to pop up again in Kings Landing.

In fact I couldn't think of anyone who has actually died by drowning, off the top of my head anyway. Am I just making links where none exist or is there something to this running theme.",gameofthrones,True,1530623752,2018-07-03

[SPOILERS S7] Why doesn't Daenerys attack King's landing?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1530630321,2018-07-03
[SPOILERS] Why doesn't Dany attack King's Landing?,"One thing that confuses me in season 7 was Dany's questionable decision not too fly right to Cersei and end that war before it started. The reasoning we are given is that Tyrion/ later Jon believe that burning Kings landing would kill thousands, but this logic is a strawman argument and I'd like to share my opinion on why, even if it's probably already been discussed to death.

First, let's address the idea that Dany would be murdering thousands of innocent small folk if she flew right to kings landing. This is a flat out lie, and Tyrion knows it. For anyone that's drawing a blank on the layout of the city I implore you to do a Google search. Cersei does NOT live in kings landing, she lives in the separate castle Maegor's Holdfast. This means that if Dany did have to burn Cersei's castle to the ground, she'd only be burning Cersei and her loyal Lord's, plus the men that are paid to be there and some slaves (the only innocent party involved).

Then there's the fact that to avoid attacking kings landing Dany and Tyrion instead decide to try a blockade and starve them out. This strategy in itself will kill mainly small folk. And that's ignoring the fact that it gave Cersei/ Jaime time to respond and start yet another war. Resulting in thousands of lives lost on both sides in the following battles of Highgarden and Casterly rock.

In conclusion, the more time that passes, the more I despise the way that Dany/ Tyrion handle her invasion of Westeros. It seems like way more people died in season 7 than could have ever been possible by simply attacking Cersei directly. Imho, Tyrion seems far more concerned with saving the family that sentenced him to death than he is helping Dany get what she wants, or saving the small folk from yet another war.

What do you think? If I'm missing something then by all means, please help me understand their thought process. Jon disagreeing with attacking Kings landing I can see, as Starks are infamous for not thinking 2/3 steps ahead, but Tyrion is supposed to be one of the best tactical minds in Westeros. But for me, he hasn't shown it since like season 4.",gameofthrones,True,1530630727,2018-07-03

Ned, upon hearing this reflects:

""and as it happens, he is of age""

However I want to make sure their money is actually well spent and they know what's going on so I need to find a way to explain the plot to them without having them watch the show.

[SPOILERS] Do the white walkers see through the weir wood trees ?,"Just rewatching the series and realized that when Sam was tracked down by the White Walker with Little Sam it was right next to one of the trees, I always wondered how he found them. 

Of corse there’s always the possibility some magic was drawing him toward the kid but it would explain why so many of the trees were getting cut down. 

Although that would raise the question ...

Are the children of the forest really on humanities side ? 

They are deeply connected to the trees and were in a huge war with the first men and were getting slaughtered. Why would all that change ? Just to fight a common threat that they created ? 

I think there’s a solid possibility that the CotF are still controlling the WW yo destroy humanity and that’s one final twist.

"[Spoilers]If there were more female writers on the show, what might have changed?","I added that *more* in the title because I didn't know if the earlier seasons had any female writers, the latest one didn't have any, I think.

One thing I think would be different is that Catelyn probably would have been the politician that she is in the books, and not the simple mother-wife she is in the show that begged Eddard not to go to KL. I honestly don't know why they made that change, it didn't make much of a difference to the story.

They created the first night king and then the second night king C. They imprisoned the 3 eyed raven and made him kill Robert, drive mad King mad used bran to kill wall magic

[SPOILERS]Best spinoff series ever? Corlys Velaryon's voyages to Essos and The Further East.,"To me, Corlys Velaryon's trips to Essos and the Further east is a very interesting topic, exploring many mystical places, and encountering many different races, he explored both the Jade Sea and the Shivering Sea, he brought many fortunes back home and was for a time the wealthiest man in Westeros, with his wealth he built his house a new seat; High Tide, which is located in the small island Driftmark near the Crownlands, he also played a big part in one of the most important events in Asoiaf, The Dance of Dragons, which lasted over 3 years.

Since there is close to no information about his travels, the only thing we do know for certain are the places he visited and the number of voyages in total; 9. And that's about it, so the only thing we could do is make speculations and assumptions about his voyages through his ship Sea Snake, which was later his nickname or alias, there was also a book written about him and his 9 voyages by Maester Mathis, unfortunately there is no information about the book too.

His first voyage would probably be to the north, where he sailed beyond the wall, into the Lands of Forever Winter, he tried to sail around to the other side, but was unsuccessful because of the frozen water of which would probably be the north pole of the world of Asoiaf, there is a small chance that he would've brought fishers and fishing equipment, since the Shivering sea is filled with expensive exotic sea creatures, such as wolf fish, sand lances, grey skates, whitefish, shark, herring, mackerel, seals, narwhals, walruses, sea lions, grey whales, white whales, humpbacks, spotted whales, and leviathans. Since sea travel is expensive, he would either already have enough gold to leave for his other voyages (either from his savings, or a loan from a major house or even the iron bank), or he would've gotten the wealth on this voyage(shipping, treasure, loot, etc), like I said, these are all assumptions, for all we know, GRRM may even write the history of Corlys Velaryon and all of what I wrote would be wrong, but that's also just an assumption since he's already 70 years old and there's way more unwritten history and lore that is missing or vague, and the chances of him confirming anything on Corlys are close to none.

**Corlys Velaryon's voyages to the North of Essos.**

So we know that he went on 9 voyages in total (not including his voyage beyond the wall). From my opinion, I think that Corlys wanted to sail to all the corners of the known world, starting with the north, then to the upper east (The Shivering Sea). We also know that he was the first person to visit Nefer and N'Ghai, and even navigate through The Thousand Islands (which are all located on the far east of northern Essos). Since we also know that his daughter was betrothed to a Sealord of Braavos, this may indicate that he sailed to the north again, this time east, and to Braavos, and who knows how many placed he stopped by on his voyages, since we also know that when he reached The Thousand Islands, he stopped his voyage and went back home, he may have stopped to restock on many places; including Braavos, Lorath, The Axe, Saath, Morosh, Bay of Tusks, Ib, Far Ib, New Ibbish and even Vaes Aresak, which are all port cities that all have their different histories and cultures, Ib for example, is a small set of islands larger than the Iron Islands in Westeros, that are particularity very interesting. Their inhabitants, are a Dwarf like race that look very similar to the ones in the Lord of The Rings, they are very much shorter than all the other races, and are very much into mining and the creation of weapons and armor made of iron or other metals, the only difference is that they are great fishers and not that much into the creation and building of stone structures. They have tried to create settlements outside of their homeland Ib, but all efforts into inhabiting the main land were stopped by the savage Dothraki who slayed them all, the only small settlement remaining is New Ibbish.

The Thousand Islands are ever far more interesting, with their inhabitants being the most shrouded and most mysterious of all the races (in my opinion), despite their name, sailors have only counted lesser than three hundred islands. The inhabitants are reportedly xenophobes, hairless green skinned beings who speak an unknown language and are also said to sacrifice any sailors they find to their evil fish-gods, it is also said that their gods can be visible underwater in a low tide, and many sailors say that The Thousand Islands are the remainder of an ancient sunken civilization that has been submerged underwater from the rising sea level, it is even said that the inhabitant are so scared of the water that they will never enter it even when threatened by death. Since you have to pass through The Thousand Islands to reach Nefer and N'Ghai, we can say that his voyage to The Thousand Islands counts as one.

It is said the the more east you go, the more mysterious it becomes, with lesser and lesser people travelling this far and going back to Westeros and document their voyages and adventures, all information becomes limited to gossip and legends. The city of Nefer is the last remaining city of the kingdom of N'Ghai, it is said to be a place shrouded in fog and mystery, and surrounded by tall chalk cliffs, it is a seen as a small town, and is reputed to be a place for necromancers and torturers, what is really weird about this certain place, is that it is said that nine-tenths of Nefer is hidden underground, which is how the city got its nickname The Hidden City, who knows maybe Corlys even explored the underground part?

So far we are certain that he went on at least 2 voyages, since we know that he went back the first time he reached The Thousand Islands, and it is also said he was the first Westerosi who explored Nefer and N'Ghai which he cannot reach by ship without passing by The Thousand Islands, now that I've covered the north, its time for the even more interesting place; the south.

**Corlys Velaryon's voyages to the South of Essos.**

To the south of Essos lays The Jade Sea, which is reputedly known for high risk and high reward reputation, the more east you go by ship for trade, the more gold you get, many sailors sail to Qarth to trade spices and sell them to rich houses in Westeros and many even go as far as Asshai to trade goods for gold and riches, one of the things we know for certain is that Corlys sailed to the Jade Sea, and got so rich he filled his ship Sea Snake with gold, and went back to Westeros to later build a whole castle for his house on Driftmark. We can also assume that his voyages to the east were after the ones in The Shivering Sea, since he reached almost to the end of the world in the north, and it is also written that on his last voyage he passed by Qarth to buy ships.

The Golden Empire of Yi Ti was once probably the only civilization to ever succeed Valyria, it a vast land that has thick, green patchwork farmland and a verdant rain forest. The God-Emperor, was once the most powerful man in the world of Asoiaf, ruling over the lands of Yi Ti, which are as large as the whole northern part of Westeros, but now with more and more chaos and independence between houses and princes, and the nonstrategic place of the city of Yin(southern most point of Yi Ti), his reign has become limited to the walls of his city, Yin.  Lomas Longstrider, a famous Westerosi explorer who is also known for his adventures to Essos and The Further East, called Yi Ti ""the land of a thousand gods and a hundred princes, ruled by one god-emperor"", The locals of Yi Ti are of similar characteristics and looks of the people living in south-east Asia in the real world. Yi Ti is said by maesters to be the oldest living civilization in the world, dating back before the the rise of the Valyrian Freehold, The Ghiscari Empire, and even before The First Men crossed The Arm of Dorne into Westeros.

Leng, a large island as big as The Vale of Arryn near Yi Ti is home to a rather queer race, the Lengii are a slender race and are the tallest race of mankind, it is said that they reach seven or even eight feet in height, they are said to be the most beautiful of all the races, with large golden colored eyes and the skin color of oiled teak. It is said that mystical beings know as The Old Ones, live under the island's surface, and long ago instructed the empress of the island to slay all foreigners who set foot in the island multiple times, until Jar Har, the sixth sea-green emperor of Yi Ti, conquered Leng,  and closed all entrances to the underground cities and ordered the Lengii to forget them. Now, the Lengii have been driven back to the southern third of the island, since YiTish locals migrated into the northern 2 thirds after Jar Har's arrival in Leng.

It is written that almost all the wealth brought back by Corlys was from Yi Ti and Leng, but the Jade sea is a very vast place, with many islands filled with pirates, warlords, and slave traders. For all we know Corlys could have maybe landed in a lot of places on his way to Yi Ti, Qarth and Leng, including Tyrosh, The Stepstones, Lys, The Summer Isles, Naath, Basilisk Isles, Volantis, Slaver's Bay, Ghaen, Port Yhos, Great and Lesser Moraq, Isle of Whips, Isle of Elephants, Marahai and Manticore Isles.

Imagine a spin-off TV show based on his adventures, seeing all those magnificent places, and characters, meeting different races, with more fictional things taking place (magic, other races, etc) the show will be amazing, going on voyages with his crew, meeting all sorts of people with different cultures, and ethnics, and even seeing mystical creatures, battling with sorcerers, necromancers, and shapeshifters, and maybe even seeing the fish gods or the old ones and exploring their tombs and temples, making a TV show based on a story this diverse and unique may be costly, from all the CGI of creatures and make up for other races, but from what I think, we have never seen a TV show with such a big budget and similarity with movies than Game Of Thrones. I guess we'll have to wait and see, since we are expecting the eighth season next year, and 5 spin-off series, who knows maybe one of those five spin-offs is about Corlys and his voyages?

The direwolves,"I am watching GOT from beginning and I don’t know if it’s because it’s my time of the month but I am sobbing about Arya making Nymeria run away. And the scene when Joffrey and Sansa go for a walk and she says stay here to Lady. Lady has a leash and collar on it made me tear up. The poor girl was trained like Paris Hilton’s chowouah . That little detail I never noticed made it even harder. I like the earlier seasons because Robert and Ned are both two good and likable  characters that have morals and values you want to root for them and then just like that they are gone. Also, Cersei who became my favorite character is so evil in the early seasons. Evil and beautiful. Arya also is adorable. Miss little arya",gameofthrones,True,1530809832,2018-07-05

[SPOILERS] Is Jon Snow going to go down as the most famous man in all of history?,"Let's just assume people are alive after this story just to humor the question.

I just finished rewatching all of GOT, and am on the ACOK for my first read through. I found myself thinking about how people will remember this time in 300 years to come, 1000 years to come.

Out of all the people in the story, I think Jon will be the one bards will sing about in the future. His feats are incredible, and they are even more so if they are exaggerated like most historic events are.

Here's how an exaggerated history of Jon Snow would go in my mind:

---

Jon Snow is exiled from Winterfell from his angry mother at a young age. His skill on the field makes him the protegee of the nights watch commander as a young teen. He is valiantly captured by the biggest army of wildlings the world has ever seen. He singlehandedly escapes, slaughtering wildlings in his wake. Back at Castle Black, he fends off a 100,000 string wildling horde with 100 men after the other high-ranking commanders ran in fear. While holding back the wildlings waiting for Stannis he kills the leader of the Thenns in single combat and takes Tormund prisoner. 

After, he saves wildings from the Other army for the greater good, killing an Other in single combat. This act of valor causes him to die at the hands of the men he commanded, he is stabbed 13 times in the chest. After his death, he rose again by the grace of the gods. Being the first man to survive the ending of his night's watch vows he retakes the north from the tyrannical, flaying, evil Boltons, avenging Robb Stark, The King In the North.

After then he becomes Jon Snow the God King, risen from the dead.

As far as the rest of history, id say it depends on if the new books follow the show, but you can easily say that he also has the chance of ending the whitewalker threat as well.

---

I love history and reading about how it bends the truth so this is a fun thought experiment for me. I believe that after this is over, he will be remembered as Jon The God King. Do you think any other man in GOT lore will be as remembered as Jon Snow?",gameofthrones,True,1530850603,2018-07-06

Rank your top 4 worst decisions by D&amp;D,"4. \*Fan Service\* Let's be real, there will be a clegane bowl, unfortunately. Jon and Daenerys will ended together. Arya or Jaime will kill Cersei. The Night King will lose to an alliance of all the good guys. Too much is too much.

3.\* Making the White Walkers the final boss.\* Honestly I hope they just wipe out everything in Westeros. At least that would be an unpredictable ending. There's a reason why I don't watch walking dead. Killing zombies is cheap entertainment. It might be expensive in costumes and CGI and it sure is cheap on dialogue and scenario. A better final boss would have been Littlefinger with Sansa at his side, or Cersei, or Daenerys, or Olenna, or Euron, or any alliance of any of those characters against Jon Snow and his unlikely allies (Tyrion, brotherhood, whoever believes Gendry is the true king, etc.. I'm sure we can find enough to make an interesting battle.) Even the High Septon spreading the seeds of rebellion accross the seven kingdoms would have been better.

2. \*Killing Littlefinger/Roose Bolton and Prince Doran.\* These were power players. These were the sharks (Jaime was talking about)\[[https://youtu.be/FZleUmd7ugA?t=94](https://youtu.be/FZleUmd7ugA?t=94)\] These guys were the reason Tywin's death was a good idea. We wanted to see them duke it out/team up/betray eachother to try to take Cersei's position. Olenna and the High Septon were good but not enough imo. If only the High Septon scenes were better I wouldn't complain but his dialogues were shit. Hardly impactful, repetitive and not a single instance of foreshadowing anything (One of GRRM's writing biggest strength imo).

I'm not saying they should die under no circumstance, but all 3 of them died before any of their implied genius/cunningness could even show. Their plans were effortlessly disrupted by much less interesting characters. At least Olenna/High Septon/Stannis/Robb had a chance to get brilliantly outplayed.

1. \*Having black and white characters\* Remember season 1? The Starks were the good guys right? And the Lannisters the bad guys right? Ned Stark (the whitest of all Game of Thrones), was hiding a Targaryen right under the nose of the King he swore fielty to. He killed a scared Night's watch deserter without verifying his claim that White Walkers exist. He wasn't the 2018 feminist women empowerer that Jon Snow is in season 7. Catelyn almost executed Tyrion unjustly. Sansa lied to protect Joffrey. The Lannisters didn't provoke the Starks into a war. They simply reacted to someone trying to take their crown. Renly/Robert were both ready to kill children for power. Even Jon Snow didn't always listen to his Night's Watch superiors. He tried to desert to help Robb (very grave offense punishable by death). He slept with Ygritte (also punishable by death). The closest we had to a fully good or fully evil character was Cersei and it was actually special and pointed out often explicitly by plenty of characters (Tyrion/Olenna/Arya) because back then, it was unique to have an evil character.

My point is everyone was gray. Now? Jon Snow,Dany, Tyrion and the Starks are whiter than Snow White. Night King, Cersei, Euron don't have a hint of good. They repeatedly chose black characters over gray ones. Why is this bad? Because now their decisions are predictable. Sansa is faced with a situation, what is she gonna do? I wonder! Of course she won't betray Arya lul. Fooled ya ;P .Damn Cersei could save Westeros by teaming up with Dany and Jon Snow, what is she gonna do? lul fooled ya again, of course she chose the most evil course of action possible.

That's my top 4. What's yours?",gameofthrones,True,1530861108,2018-07-06

Watching the series before reading?,"I've been reading through this sub at these posts where everyone always asks if they should read or watch the series first.

To me it seems like theres plenty of people on both sides of this issue.

From what I gather:

Pros of watching series first:
-Put a name to a face
-Geographic visual
-Won't be let down by the lack of details coming from the book

Cons:
-Spoilers I guess?

Is this pretty much consensus information at this point? Everyone always says the books are way to complex and confusing if you have no prior knowledge. The writing style is also apparently awkward which doesn't help.",gameofthrones,True,1530881189,2018-07-06

[SPOILERS] Hold the door?,"This was a really entertaining and emotional scene but what exactly is happening? Bran is in a trance, having a vision, while in the vision he wargs into vision Hodor and that allows him to control regular present Hodor while staying in the vision for no reason and seeming to not focus on controlling present hodor. He controls Hodor to make him drag his own body out of the tunnel and continues to controls him, forcing him to hold the door, giving up his own life. While Bran was sacrificing/killing Hodor, Meera shouted something unnecessarily at him (she didnt need to order him since bran was controlling him like meera had asked him to) and past vision Hodor heard this third-party in the present shouting at present hodor through bran's vision and this shout broke his brain forever? Was it a noble sacrifice on hodor's part? Did Bran stop controlling him at some point before he died? He didnt seem guilty or anything the next time we saw him. The whole thing just seems kinda convoluted and confusing and then was never mentioned again.",gameofthrones,True,1530882528,2018-07-06
"[SPOILERS]Found this somewhere (it was about ygrite and jon),all credit goes to The the Genius","You people do realize that Jon is NOT the same boy he was when he met Ygritte? Here, he was quite literally a noob virgin, with no experience. Their romance worked well because a) they were both regular people. Jon might have been a sworn brother, but in those seasons he still carried some of that selfishness that comes with youth (people will remember that in S1 he acted better than everyone else, got bitter when Mormont named him steward instead of a ranger. At the time he was till too wrapped up in himself to see the bigger picture) Combine that with his inexperience when it comes to love and girls, and you get someone who is capable of cracking and giving in to his desires more easily (especially when you have someone as forceful as Ygritte coming on to him). Yet this romance, no matter how good was doomed to end, and here's why; it was a nescecary catalyst meant to develop Jon's character. Ygritte is quite literally Aemon's speech; love, selfish and turbulent love that in the end always ends up killing duty. You even get confirmation of this when Ygritte asks Jon to stay in the cave with her, ergo forsake his duty and the lives of his sworn brothers for love. Jon at this point, has spent some time with the wildlings, has seen what they are, and no matter how close he's become with them, he realizes that they will have no mercy on his brothers. He already has second thoughts about staying with Ygritte when the wildings kill that horse breeder and he is finally brought back to reality, whereupon he realizes that there are more important things than his desires. The values his instilled in him rise up and he makes the ultimate decision. To forsake love in favor of duty, thus killing the last remnant of that selfish boy, and finally becoming the self sacrificing and selfless Jon we know.  B) shes the alpha, the instigator, and he was the passive beta too shy to do anything but comply. When it comes to writing a romance, an alpha-beta relationship is the easiest thing to develop, since the alpha is there to instantly start it (almost immediately after they'd met, Ygritte started flirting with him, instantly confirming a romance) and quickly push it along (again, it's easy to develop a relationship and bring it to a quick climax when the alpha is constantly flirting and pretty much dominating the beta).  Now we come to Jon and Dany. He is no longer that naive, selfish and inexperienced boy. He is KITN, a grown man who got betrayed and murdered, a leader who has others depending on him. A man who has pushed love aside in favor of duty. He has become an alpha, a powerful alpha at that. Just like Dany (who had a similar alpha-beta relationship with Khal Drogo. One that transformed her into an alpha as well). The dynamic between the two is obviously going to be differert since a) they're self sacrificing monarchs who always put their people first. Their duties are front and center in their minds; that's why their first meeting was a charged power struggle rather than a session of romantic bantering. They didn't come before each other like a man and a woman, like Jon and Ygritte had. They met as a King and a Queen, two powerful players ready to gouge the other out as either a potential ally or enemy. In such strict conditions there obviously isn't going to be room for them to act freely and naturally. Even in the caves, when their body language hinted that they could relax and be natural around each other, their duties still loomed large enough to eclipse their personal desires. Jon quite simply said it best; there is no time for that. He has given up on love, because he has come to believe that it will interfere with his duty, and for that reason he resists his feelings. And since Dany is in the EXACT same situation as he, she is definitely not going to agressievly come on to him, like Ygritte had. Hence why their romance isn't going to be so blantantly obvious and in your face. Its going to happen through quick, guilty looks (something Davos and Tyrion have both pointed out, and we ourselves have seen in ep5 when Jon petted Drogon. He stared at her for half a second after she mentioned the dragons being her children before shaking his head and guiltily looking away, like he's already betraying his duty just by entertaining the idea), subtle body language (the cave scene and their farewell both hinted that they were now more open and trusting toward each other) and facial expressions (Dany's face when he told her he was going beyond the wall, their expressions during their convo after the mission beyond the wall).  B) they're both alphas, and such relationships are always more difficult to develop for any writer, mostly because such characters are on the same emotional level. Meaning that a relationship like that moves slowly, and subtly. And  it only officially starts when one of them exibits a moment of vulnerability (as Dany has in ep6) Only then, will their walls be broken down, and they will allow themselves to finally let go and love each other. Dany is quite literally everything Jon is, everything he has become. A love with her doesn't demand for him to sacrifice his duty, but rather emrabce and share it's burden with her (something which is echoed in  Dany's quote from ep6. ""We are going to destroy the NK and his army. We'll do it together"" So in conclusion of the stupid analysis no one is going to read, Ygritte is the love of Jon's youth, someone who shaped his character perfectly and made him into what he is today. Dany is the love of his manhood, someone who is going to strengthen his character and share his burdens.﻿ ",gameofthrones,True,1530883292,2018-07-06

[Spoilers] My theory on the ending.,"I heard that dragonglass is made from dragon fire. A dragon helped forge the Iron Throne.
My idea is that the Night King destroys everything. From the Wall down to King's Landing, the NK wipes out all the characters in great battles, while the characters fight among themselves in infighting. (Like Cersei and Dany, for instance)
So The Night King takes King's Landing. He walks through the Red Keep turning the dead into wights. He reaches the throne room, and moves up to the Iron Throne. Then he sits on the Throne...
...and shatters. His link to every other White Walker and wight is broken and they die as well. 
The army of the dead is defeated, and the world is saved, but for a great swath of the population and all our characters. Bittersweet ending indeed.",gameofthrones,True,1530906177,2018-07-06

[SPOILERS] finale theory,"Okay so I may not be the first one to think of this theory, but I haven't seen anyone mentioning it and it came to my mind recently, I had to share it. I was rewatching season 2, the episode where Daenerys is in Qarth looking for her dragons in the house of the undying. While in there, she has this hellucination/dream where she's in the throne room, it's snowing, she's approaching the throne, and right as she's about to touch it she turns around to see Drogo and their unborn child. Now I may be overthinking this but I thought it could be foreshadowing for the ending of the show, when Daenerys will choose love (Drogo) over power (the throne), and she won't rull after all. Plus, as we all know, she's no ordinary woman, her dreams come true! Whice made me think this could be a clue for the ending. What do you think?",gameofthrones,True,1530908245,2018-07-06

[Spoilers] Possible Lady Stoneheart Replacement Story Line,"So the Lady Stoneheart story line is for sure out. Showrunners have confirmed it and there's simply not enough time to incorporate it into season 8 even if they wanted.

I still think Beric will sacrifice himself to bring back an important character. The way I see it, there are two possibilities.

Beric sacrifices his life to resurrect Jon after he's killed by the Night King or the army of the dead.

Beric sacrifices his life to resurrect the Hound after he dies from his wounds by the Mountain or the army of the dead.

In both instances, Beric is sacrificing his life to bring back someone he has a mutual respect for, and I feel that, if Beric does sacrifice himself to resurrect one of these men, that man is a strong Azor Ahai candidate. 

I have this image stuck in my head. We'll use the Hound as I feel it's the strongest example given their stronger emotional connection.

The Hound defeats the Mountain but dies shortly after from his wounds. Beric stands in front of his body, kneels beside him, studies him carefully and makes his decision. Raising his sword, he ignites it and says ""Lord of Light, I thank you for my life, but this man needs it more."" His eyes go dark and the fire goes out. Beric collapses dead as the Hound's eyes open. Realizing what he's done, the Hound screams into a cold dark sky, ""NO! Not for me! Take it back!""",gameofthrones,True,1530933173,2018-07-06

In flash back images from bran we often see a dragon hovering over kings landing a scene we always thought was Daenerys or aegon targayen but could it be the night king? Also in qarth, Daenerys sees the iron throne covered in snow ( or was it ash?) Maybe symbolizing the night king taking over kings landing. I know there are a lot of holes, like how could a whole army just sneak by the north and basically all of Westeros without being seen and take kings landing and why would the creators of the show have all of the targaryens army and northern army travel one way and just have to travel back kings landing?

1. Tommen on throne and a boy he could control completely.
2. Tyrion is finally dead.
3. Jamie leaves Kings guard and becomes his heir.

I assume that he very well knew about Tyrion's innocence.

[Spoilers] Ending Theory regarding the Iron Throne,"Here's my theory (which has probably been shared/suggested before by other people):

My guess is that Gendry will become King in the end.

There's a reason why Melisandre took Gendry in. Otherwise, he'd have no part in the story. Like literally, his existence could have just been ignored and he could have lived his life not knowing who his father was. (And who would have cared if he died?)

My guess is that he will be legitimized (somehow) by the end of the series (TV series, not sure about the books) and that Dany and/or Jon will die. ***Sadface.***

Originally I thought that Jon and/or Dany would live to the end and become King and/or Queen. But after thinking about it and realizing that Gendry was taken in my Melisandre herself---who is instrumental in this Long Night Finale arc---I realized that her action in doing so was actually significant. And because she did so, I now believe that Gendry will become King of the Seven Kingdoms. (I don't know how he's going to be legitimized though....or maybe the Kingdom will just acknowledge that he's king because he's got Robert's blood and maybe Essos/the laws will be different after the Long Night? Idk.)

As much as I hate to say it, I think Dany and/or Jon are gonna die (and Gendry becomes King). Even if I didn't originally see it that way.

It sounds pretty anti-climactic, especially when we're talking about a non-main character (Gendry). But being that this is the end of the story, it's a valid ending.

Why doesn't Dany want the Iron Throne?,"The main reason and initial reason was always regaining her ancestral right to rule the seven kingdoms and to take revenge to those who betrayed and tried to kill her. But during the course of her life, from being sold to Dothraki by her brother to the point where she has three dragons, army and friendship of intelligent and influential people, she has come a long way. Her goal of revenge and reclaiming her birthright has now been discarded or rather has been deprioritized.

She thinks she has the courage, the brain(of course most of Tyrion's brain as well), the power and most importantly the drive to achieve the vision that she has set for herself and is ready to deal with the enemies and the people who are not aligned to/blocking her vision with equal force and ferociousness.

Now that she has seen the world she understands that there are better things to fight for with all the power she has. Which is to fight for others, live be for others and even die for others. This is what gives her bigger purpose and better sense of satisfaction now than her earlier vision which could be called childish.

But sitting on Iron Throne doesn't really matter to her any more. Her iron throne is leberation of the downtrodden and breaking the wheel of constant tussle between the kingdoms which crushs the people under it for centuries.

And now once she is closer the iron throne(the actual physical one) all the things that she ever wanted to do after gaining the iron throne would have been done even before she actually reaches/sits on it.

So it will be of no surprise if she is either withdraws from her initial vision to sit on the throne and does something like establishing a counsil which will govern the realm or even hand it over to able hands, like that of her own Hand, Tyrion ;)

I know the last part was a bit of overreach as GoT being GoT no one knows what will happen. I expect Tyrion becoming the King with Sansa, his legally wedded wife, by his side will rule the kingdom like no one else before them :P",gameofthrones,True,1530975135,2018-07-07

This is what gives her bigger purpose and better sense of satisfaction now than her earlier vision which could be called childish.

But sitting on Iron Throne doesn't really matter to her any more. Her iron throne is leberation of the downtrodden and breaking the wheel of constant tussle between the kingdoms which crushs the people under it for centuries.

And now once she is closer the iron throne(the actual physical one) all the things that she ever wanted to do after gaining the iron throne would have been done even before she actually reaches/sits on it.

So it will be of no surprise if she is either withdraws from her initial vision to sit on the throne and does something like establishing a counsil which will govern the realm or even hand it over to able hands, like that of her own Hand, Tyrion ;)

I know the last part was a bit of overreach as GoT being GoT no one knows what will happen. I expect Tyrion becoming the King with Sansa, his legally wedded wife, by his side will rule the kingdom like no one else before them :P",gameofthrones,True,1530975758,2018-07-07

[Spoilers] I am new to this sub. I have had a thought lurking on the edge of my brain for several months. Let me know what you think.,"I've watched the first six seasons at least four times. Never read the books. I've also seen season 7. 
 The thing that keeps pulling at me, screaming that I should understand it; after seven seasons, is the song of fire and ice. 
 I've seen a lot of theories about it, but I find them incomplete. 
 I would like to postulate that a factor that everyone could be missing is something shoved in our face from episode one. 
 There are two forces with enough power to bring life to the dead. The fire good, and the ice king. (Though the ice Kings magic seems to be incomplete or different.)
 I'm wondering if any of you super fans can shed some light on this for me. 
 In me head cannon, I'm seeing a biblical-like war between good and evil that has been waging for millennia. Unbeknownst to our heroes, they're already allied with ""fire"" by default. 
 The question might become, ""will those with free will to fight amongst themselves, or unify against a threat. Overcome an autocratic ruller that weilds complete control.""

[No Spoilers] Just a theory about the Hound,"Ok, so I was watching the last few episodes of season 7 of GoT the other night, and I don't know if it was the lack of sleep getting to me or not but I started to wonder something about the upcoming season. 

So the priest (of the God of Light, I can' t think of his name) who was able to resurrect people, had the Hound look into the fire and asked what he saw. Eventually the Hound said he saw a mountain that looked like an arrowhead. As the expedition went on, as they were walking, the Hound made a comment that that was the mountain that he saw in the fire, and later in the episode the priest died.

Now fast forward to the next season. What if the Hound is the next priest of fire. If you recall he did find some ""religion / spirituality"" with  when the small village/tribe he was with before they were killed, and he avenged their deaths. So he does have some sense of believing in a religion, and he has proven that he can ""read"" fire (for lack of a better term). This is beginning to get me to think, when (not if, WHEN) Clegane-Bowl happens, the Mountain starts to get the upperhand on the Hound, and he busts out not just the sword he's using, but rather a flaming sword like some of the others, and uses an flame imbued sword to kill his brother? 
(Thoughts, ideas, or was I just sleep deprived and looking way to into it? Let's face it, GoT does do a lot of foreshadowing, so could the Hound looking into the fire mean something given his history with fire, or was that just a fluke?)",gameofthrones,True,1531010276,2018-07-07

Two weeks until my summer vacation starts. I will binge 1-7 seasons as fast as possible,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1531019691,2018-07-07
[NO SPOILERS] Two weeks until my summer vacation starts. I will binge 1-7 seasons as fast as possible,"Hi everyone!

I'm going to use this thread as a personal ventilator when I start what I'm about to tell you next.

Usually we've been able to get summer holidays at the same time with my fiancee. Then we usually do a trip and some light traveling in our own country (we're Finnish). This summer was a bummer as my fiancee could not get her holidays at the same time as I have. In turn, I wasn't able to change my holidays to fir her's. So I ended up with something that's not even a bad thing. A lot of free time. I'm still planning on doing something else than just sitting in front of my TV but I believe it will be a big part of my holidays still.

I'm a big fan of the show and equally big fan of the books (although I'm still going on the Feast of Crows and have the Dance of Dragons to devour later on) and I've been wanting to do either a re-read of the books in a binge fashion or re-watch the show in binge fashion. Optimally you'd like to have the complete series you're binging on but I happened to have this rare opportunity of free time so I won't be too picky.

My fiancee works a job that makes her move around quite a bit. So she's going to be away about 4 or so days of the week. The time when she's home will be basically sleeping and maybe some dinner. So I'll also have the apartment almost completely to myself.

My plan is simple. My summer holidays start at 23rd or July. I intent to watch seasons 1-7 in 5 days during that first week. The total running time of those seven seasons will be approximately 63 hours and 30 minutes. I stock up on food and beverages (a lot of wine and strong alcohol is required so I can relate to characters as Tyrion and Robert Baratheon). I turn off my phone for the time when I'm watching. Which is going to be more or less 13 hours a day. Two breaks between the viewing so I can get some fresh air. Go running or hit the gym or just go to the beach and buy an ice cream. I'm going to limit my ""press stop and make a ridiculous face whenever someone surprising is killed"" to the upper tier characters only. Otherwise my schedule will be ruined. Ultimately, I hope to get a good head start as the fatigue is hitting me in days 4 and 5. I'd rather be few hours ahead of my schedule at the morning of the 4th than to be a second late. Last but no the least, I hope to figure out a drinking game for the series since few friends of mine will be joining this marathon for one sprint.

I've been working on how to fill my fridge to get enough nutrition for 5 intense days of sitting on the couch. At first I though I'd just buy the chips/chocolate/soda/frozen pizza/etc. combo that is usually the junk you eat while having a movie night. But my fiancee pointed out that I'm getting older. Already north of 30 and I can't do the same diet I did when I was younger. 5 days of cheese and nachos will ruin my insides forever. So I'll make a detailed menu following the 5 days. It will gradually get worse cause I do want to get the full candy/chocolate/beer/pizza/whiskey experience but I have to ease my body in to it.

Overall, I'm really excited to get off from work and start watching GoT. It will probably be almost overwhelming but I feel confident that I can make it happen.

Wish me luck! I will be posting on this topic as my plans advance. In a week I'm starting to carry the drinks home. Will be fun.

Also, has anyone noticed the female characters' relationships with lemons? Lemon trees, lemon cakes.  from what I've gotten so far in the books, Sansa and Dany all have some connection to lemons as innocence- Sansa being thrilled by lemon cakes when she thought Joffrey was a regular person with human emotions, Dany wishing she could go back to the house with the lemon tree and the red door. Has anyone noticed any other ""lemon"" references? There must be at least one more if it's important; everything seems to happen in threes.

I also noted that Jon, Dany, and Tyrion all never knew their mothers. Therefore, all three were powerful enough that only death could give them life. This is one of the reasons I agree with the theory that Tyrion is not a Lannister.

[SPOILERS] Where did rumors of 1.5 - 2hr episodes in S8 originate from?,"There is a thread on /r/television about the upcoming season, and multiple people commented that every episode is as long as a movie - answers range from 90 minutes to 2 hours (?!?!). I've noticed similar comments in here as well. Can someone please point to me the source of that rumor?

From http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-season-7-running-times-revealed-record-length-season-finale-included/

&gt; Historically, the average episode ranges very little from season to season (from a low of 54:25 in season two to a high of 56:08 in season one), so it’s fair to claim this season leaps ahead with its 63 minutes average — that is, 8 minutes longer than the typical Game of Thrones episode. Though the longer episodes do not make up for the missing three, they do make up for one of them; this season may as well have eight episodes.

From https://winteriscoming.net/2018/01/12/will-season-8-episodes-be-super-sized-kit-harington-and-hbo-weigh-in/

&gt; We know we have six episodes – we are not sure whether they will run for 70 minutes or even 90 minutes

I feel like media played the telephone game with each other when Kit Harrington at a random interview casually dropped ""90 minutes."" People started calling it a full-length movie, then someone jumped from full-length movie to ""2 hours.""

[SPOILERS] Season 8 Prediction,"**PREDICTION:**

Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, will give birth to a litter of direwolves.

**EVIDENCE:**

1. Daenerys cannot give birth to a human child. She had a stillborn son, Rhaego, who was described as, ""scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like wings of a bat."" Rhaego looked like a dragon but her children won't be dragons.

2. Jon is a Targaryen but looks like a Stark. The Stark seed must be stronger than Targaryen seed which is why Jon has Stark features instead of Targaryen ones. We now that brown hair must always win since Ned was able to find out that Cersei's children were not also Robert's because Baratheon also have strong seed. So it's likely Jon's children will be more Stark than Targaryen

3. Daenerys (dragon) and Jon Snow (wolf) had sex and the show seems to be pointing toward Jon impregnating Daenerys. This means that Jon will be fertilizing Daenerys’ eggs with his “stronger than Targaryen” Stark seed.

4. GRRM was going to title the last book A Time for Wolves. This points to the direwolves having a rebirth in the story. It's likely that all the direwolves found at the beginning of the story will die so Jon and Daenerys' probably have six direwolves at the end of season 8.

**REASONABLE QUESTIONS:**

* How do you know that there will be six?

Since we saw that the direwolf at the beginning of story had a litter of six direwolves, Daenerys will also have a litter of six direwolves to symbolize a rebirth. 

* What about Daenerys and Jon's Targaryen side?

The Targaryen (dragon) part of Jon and Daenerys' genes will cause Daenerys to lay eggs. She will lay six eggs and the eggs will hatch into a litter of direwolf pups. If Daenerys can lay a Rhaego, she can lay a Doggo [(Imgur).](https:imgur.com/kOcLZpZ)",gameofthrones,True,1529630832,2018-06-21

[NO SPOILERS]Whose performance do you think has improved the most over the course of the show?,"There were plenty of people who started out great, and didn't need to improve. There were others that started off pretty poorly, but got better. I think that Emilia Clarke definitely has a top spot here. She's not incredible by any stretch of the imagination, but I think that she has improved a lot since the beginning of the show. I also think that Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's accent has improved a lot as well. His accent was never terrible, but in the beginning of the show I don't think he hides his Denmark accent too well. As the show goes on though, he improves a lot at hiding it. Who are your biggest picks for people that have improved?

If it is just the writing, it's such an easy fix too. Have Dany riding another one and NK spears Drogon in the air because he's the biggest (if he still is, not sure) and his arrogance leads him to believe Dany is not a threat",gameofthrones,True,1529642268,2018-06-22

[SPOILERS] A Counter theory on Sandor Clegane,"Now if you read the title yes, this is sort of a counter theory/prediction I have for the Hound if Cleganebowl does not end up happening or Hound dies earlier then we think. Now I do think Cleganebowl will happen, I believe the Hound will fight the Mountain protecting Arya and will win and kill his brother via fire but at a great cost as not long after he will die from losing a huge amount of blood but before he does Arya and/or Sansa will be at his side telling him he will die a hero Sandor Clegane and NOT a Hound (Symbolisms galore I know), However this is like I said a counter theory if that does not happen and is somewhat inspired by Bridge4’s vid on why Cleganebowl will NOT happen. So basically Cleganebowl is NOT an actual battle but more of a psychological one and that being of Sandor needed to forget the past and get rid of his hatered (especially for his brother, not saying he should forgive his brother but what I mean by is just forget his vengeful ways). 

Sandor has won that battle as he found a new family in the form of the Brotherhood, Tormund, and most likely the stark sisters, yes he is still a fighter but he has changed, and to fit more better with his arc he will die protecting Sansa from either a White Walker, the Night King, or Euron when/if he surprise attacks WF. Sansa would be near him as he dies and Sansa the Lady Bird will sing to him as he dies. But who will fight the Mountain you ask…well Either Arya, Jaime and Brienne, or (in the coolest full circle act ever) Samwell Tarly (okay that last one is my own tinfoil idea but still).",gameofthrones,True,1529677308,2018-06-22

A highlight of poor writing in a season of poor writing (SHOW SPOILERS),[removed],gameofthrones,True,1529684497,2018-06-22
[SPOILERS] A highlight of poor writing in a season of poor writing.,"The scene in season 7 where Melisandre meets Daenerys and explains the Azor Ahai prophecy to her will always stand out to me as just clunky and exposition done poorly. Specifically, I’m talking about the bit of dialogue where Daenerys basically explains she cannot be the prince that was promised because she’s not a man. Missandei explains that the noun ‘prince’ in High Valyrian doesn’t have a gender so it’s ‘The Prince/Princess that was promised.’ 

This to me is just really poor writing. When Daenerys frees the Unsullied she explains to the master (who had been insulting her under the premise that she did not speak High Valyrian) that High Valyrian was her mother tongue. So it just doesn’t make sense that she should be the one to have this explained to, from a logical or writing standpoint. 

I understand that this is a prophecy and idea the show wants to pursue, and I understand that it hasn’t been fully flushed out in the show as well as it has in the books so they need to leave the breadcrumbs for non-book readers. But this is just so god damn lazy and the delivery of this scene was honestly clunky. 

An easy rewrite would be to have the scene play out almost the same way except have Tyrion be the stand-in for the audience who doesn’t know High Valyrian. He has already displayed that his High Valyrian is novice at best. And then you could even have Daenerys explain it to him while side-eyeing Melisandre because she’s realizing what she’s saying to her. That she could be Princess that was promised. 

Or have it written almost any other way so that it conveys to the audience that: 
A. The show wants to pursue this plot line
B. It doesn’t have to be a man

[Spoilers] Watched and interesting theory on Bran but I don’t think it’s complete,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S1mFoDK4sUQ

Here’s the video detailing why Bran is the night king. Maybe he isn’t but that doesn’t mean the rest of the evidence can’t be true. I believe he does try to warg into people to change the past and continually fails like the mad king saying burn them all just like hodor does hold the door. I believe he also built the wall as well. Weather he actually becomes the night king though is where I’m iffy 

I don’t believe it stops there though. Bran eventually learns that going back in time by warging or taking physical form has drastic consequences he decides to take a more off hands approach. How does he do that?

He communicates to the past through flames sending messages about how to stop the white walkers. In other words he’s the lord of light.",gameofthrones,True,1529707152,2018-06-22

* Bronn and the Sand Snakes in prison. God-awful dialogue. And the ''bad pussy'' line. Painfully bad.
* Uncle Benjen rescues Jon. Far too convenient and very dissapointing end to that storyline.
* Grey Worm and Missandei love scene. It took too long and added literally nothing to the episode. Could've done without this one.
* Jon bends the knee to Daenerys. It was a poorly written scene. Most of the dialogue was cheesy and unbelievable. Jon calling her ''Dany''. Cringe.

[Spoilers] Why is a certain ceremony done in the style of the seven?,"Lyanna is a Stark and would have worshiped the old gods. 

Rhaegar is a Targaryen- there is no real indication that the Targs kept to any specific religion, what with their history of incest and dragon-lordship.  It is possible that as the royal family, they were polite about doing things for the Seven like the common people, but again, no indication that it was actually their belief.

So, when R &amp; L marry, why is the ceremony the hand fasting which seeks the blessing of the Seven?  Their officiant is not a Septon, it's a Maester.  The ceremony is in secret, so there is no judgment to be passed by the common people. 

My own theory is laziness. We've seen what a wedding looks like when the parties believe in the seven and we haven't seen a wedding for those who keep the old gods.  No creativity needed to reuse the ceremony and words we've already seen.  I find it a bit of a let down.",gameofthrones,True,1529719427,2018-06-22

[SPOILERS] Fast ravens and time jumps have always been there since Season 1,"I have read all of the complaints in the ""Beyond the Wall"" episode, and most of them are about how fast time and the ravens/dragons were and Gendry running. I don't see any problem about this. There have always been quick time-jumps and fast ravens since the beginning.
S1E1 - Cersei/Jaime were in King's Landing, then the next few scenes, they're now in Winterfell.
S1E2 - Starks &amp; Lannisters were all in Winterfell at the start, then later, Snow and Tyrion are at the Wall, and the rest are in Riverlands (the Inn) at the end.
S1E3 - They arrived in King's Landing, then later, Catelyn arrived in King's Landing too—she left before the last sequence of the previous episode.
S1E4 - Tyrion with Yoren arrived in Winterfell (left the Wall previously), then later met Catelyn at the Inn (Riverlands), who just left King's Landing previously.
S1E5 - Yoren reached King's Landing, Cat/Tyrion arrived at the Eyrie, and then Jaime received the news about Tyrion's kidnapping.
S1E6 - Robb received the raven's news about Ned fighting Jaime
S1E7 - Jorah, who was in Vaes Dothrak, received the King's pardon from Westeros (which was sent episode 5 or 6).
S1E8 - Ned is now in the dungeon. Cersei made Sansa write the letter, and the NEXT scene—Robb received Sansa's letter and send ravens to the bannermen. Next scene, Catelyn, at the Eyrie, received news about Ned in the dungeon. Later, all the bannermen are in Winterfell. Then the Starks left Winterfell. And then Cat, all the way from the Vale, met Robb at the battle camps in Riverlands (maybe). All in the one episode.

Time jumps and fast ravens have always been there. the difference was Season 1 had tons of characters to interject, whereas in Season 7, only two or three scenes can be intercut because of l̶e̶s̶s̶ fewer characters.",gameofthrones,True,1529727503,2018-06-23

[SPOILERS] My thoughts on a theory on the NK,"So if you don't know there is a theory that Bridge4 a GOT youtuber created about the NK, in the three part vid (and some other vids he did including his vid on the prequel spin-off which I will link here), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpN5APGesIY&amp;t=1s

He believes that everything about the Age of Heroes and the Long night was built on a lie (or atleast was misinterpreted), and that the NK we see is really the Night's King/The Last hero/The 13th Lord Commander. The videos are pretty good and I would recommend watching all three before looking at my thoughts on it today:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_Ve94lUvbw

Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEsWpQ1LrWE

Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdYcw99JxFc

Okay so I would recommend watching all three vids first before continuing to read this as I will be giving my thoughts on the theory and also give my interpretation on how I believe things played out if this theory turns out to be true (basically after I give my thoughts, I'll be giving you my version of the theory). So anyways what do I think of the theory? personally I actually kindof like it. Because for one it still fits with GRRM's Anti-War message and we know the ending will be atleast similar to the books (and I don't think D&amp;D would want to mess up the ending and the overall message of the story, atleast I hope not), It would be fitting that the NK like most characters on GOT is still a morally grey character (yes he killed a lot of people but still), and also I actually think it is a kindof cool idea, that his tale is somewhat a parallel to Jon's arc. But with a more screwed up fate.

So yeah if this was the case, i'd be content with it to be honest, Do I think the NK is the Night's King? Personally no as D&amp;D have stated there two different characters and also I still believe the NK is a Proto-Stargaryen (as in the first child of ice and fire, but that is a theory for another day), But this is kindof like my favorite counter theory if my Proto-Stargaryen theory ends up being false. But however there are problems with the NK=Night's king/Last Hero/13th Lord Commander theory, First up the timelines don't really add up (as I am pretty sure Bael the Bard (who is the NK's father in this theory) wasn't around during the Long Night (atleast I don't think he is). He also stats the guy we see get turned by the children is the Night's king and that makes straight up no sense since there is no snow on the ground.

You can argue the Long Night was not happening then and Bridge4 argues that the snow when away when the first long night ended and he was turned around the time the Andals arrive but that requires a huge stretch. Also in order for this theory to work in the show it would require a HUGE exposition dumb which I don't think is something we need with six episodes left, and on top of that being near the endgame. Meaning if this is true it would end up being a dumbed down/Simplified version of it (and no one wants to see that). That being said I still really like the theory and if it turns out the NK is the 13th Lord Commander AND the son of Bael the Bard that in my opinion would be very interesting.

Anyways now here it is, My version/interpretation of the NK=Night's king/Last Hero/13th Lord Commander by Bridge4.

So anyways if this turns out to be true I believe that the children and the Giants where living in peace but not only did the First men come around but also some early followers of TLOL (as there are buildings in Westeros such as the Iron Islands and the Citadel that resembles something from Essos) anyways the children create the Others in a attempt to not only fight off the first men but also the early followers of the Red God, but surprise surprise...that just makes things even worse. So the children create a pact with the First men to push back the early followers of the Red God and also Others, building the wall to keep out the WW's with the children also destroying the bridge between Dorne and Essos to keep out the Red God Followers and any other first men. 

At some point Bael the Bard (the bearded NK in the cave drawings and maybe the person we see get turned by the children in Bran's vision) sneaks into WF and takes a Stark girl with her, I am not going to say the entire Bael the Bard story because if you know about then you know how it goes. Anyways they were actually in love and The Stark girl had a child, This child was a bastard (like Jon) and left to the Wall where he fought off the Others and anything else that is a threat, He however at some point falls in love with a woman (either Dany Flint or a White Walker woman (who could be revealed to be his half-sister, paralleling Dany and Jon kindof)) and they get married and the 13th lord commander declares himself king. His brother Brandon the Breaker does not like this and yeah you know the rest.

Anyways Night's King with some other companions including his close friend the Last Hero go off beyond the wall but at some point they are captured by the others with the Andals coming they turn him into the new NK...The NK we see on the show.",gameofthrones,True,1529846967,2018-06-24
[SPOILERS] scene in S7E6 seems illogical...,"regarding the mission beyond the wall. Not the humans, but what the Night King either does or doesn't do throughout it. Theories suggest he planned for the dragons to come north in order to seize one, but what happens doesn't seem to help his cause. Apologies if it's a bit messy.

**Option 1)** Night King attempts to lure a dragon north of the wall

*Problems:* if he wants the dragons to come, then he needs to keep the group alive in order to give Daenerys a reasons to stay long enough so he can kill one. If she saw that the group had been killed, she would likely leave before the NK could kill one. 

      However, the Walkers don't stop the Wights from attacking the group. They learn to attack because Clegane is throwing rocks on the ice, they learn they can go in small numbers to attack the group. What if they killed them before Daenerys arrived? Or was it just coincidence? 

        Yes, this issue assumes the Night King wouldn't be able to kill a dragon before she left, but why would she stay considering everyone has been killed by Wights? And seeing as the NK took his time getting a spear handed slowly by a Walker, it seems he may need a bit of time.

**Option 2)** he was unaware of the dragons/them coming north

*Problems:* if he didn't know, why did he just camp his army around the lake do nothing? If Daenerys didn't come and Clegane wasn't throwing rocks, they'd still be sitting there. They could probably survive a couple days as they were. 

           Was the NK A) going to wait for them to die of natural causes, or B) wait until the Wights become intelligent enough to cross the lake slowly? Neither seems in his best interest. He could've instructed the Wights to go slowly (unless he wasn't smart enough either...), used his ice magic/powers, or started lobbing spears at them for fun.

It seems really contrived, but maybe it's just down to bad writing/directing. Still was an enjoyable episode, but these (among other things) seems like a rather glaring issue. 

What're your thoughts or ideas?",gameofthrones,True,1529852637,2018-06-24
[SPOILERS] Jaime Lannister ending game,"Jaime Lannister will be the Hand of the King for King Aegon Targaryen 

On season one we were literally told by Tyrion Lannister on episode 1, that Jaime was the handsome brother and that Tyrion was the smart one. That of course, its not a lie, but I do think it was a way for books and show to deceives us, to overestimate Tyrion’s intelligence and underestimate Jaime’s capability as a leader and as a judge of human character. Jaime was the one who told to Jory on S1 E4  how dangerous Theon seemed to be for House Stark and what a risk his was for the family, while Tyrion could only mock the way Theon talked about his masters. Jaime proved to be the one right since later Theon would betray House Stark and take Winterfell.

Saving the lives of innocent people and spare blood shed seems to be a constant on Jaime’s live. He saved the life of millions of people in KL and instead of being made a hero, he became a disgraced man, and oathbreaker, a man without honor because only few knew the reason why he did what he did. 

Yet, Jaime still kept on trying to save lives during his life, in fact, it got my attention in my re watch that he did offer himself to fight Robb Stark in a man to man combat, in order to avoid the war between Starks and Lannisters. Thats exactly what Jon Snow did in season 6, but of course at the time we all thought he was a jackass to make such offer, because we knew it he was a great swordfighter and would of course beat Robb Stark, but he was trying to save the lives of thousands because that’s one of the constants in Jaime’s life. He is always trying to avoid more blood shed. 

When he was sent to Riverland to take back the Tully’s castle he tried every way he could to avoid more deaths and more conflicts. First he tried to use diplomacy but when that didn’t work he lied to Edmure Tully and told him he would kill his son, it was a drastic way, but it did avoid even more destruction and deaths in the Riverlands. I think that’s one of the most important points of the books. A leader, a king, a ruler should always try to save their people and try other methods before war. George RRM is a anti war man, but he does believes that some war are necessary and unavoidable, BUT if there is chance for peace, it should be explored.

So, I believe George RRM has big plans for Jaime in the end of this story and will award him with a hppy ending for caring so much for the lives of the people in Westeros. 

I believe that Jaime will be Aegon Targaryen Hand of the King, I know many believe it will be Tyrion, but Tyrion was the man who brought the Mad Kings Daughter to Westeros and that I think it wont end well. Here are the clues that I got it from the show.

* S1E1 in his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days. Remember Jaime always uses jokes to deflect insecurance or frustration. I actually think he likes the idea.


* S1E1 When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. ""The Starks are feasting on this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people""

That already got my attention. I expect the Jon and the Starks to rule the kingdom in the end and a new time, a time for wolves to start in Westeros by the end of this story, and I think Jaime will be the last Lannister left to restore his House.

* S1E2 Later we see Jaime going to Jon Snow to thank him for joining the NW, he offers his right hand and makes a joke about Jon's decision. They even make sure to focus on the hand shake.

* When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King ""how do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it?

Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.


* S1E5 - in the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.

* S1E5 Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!

How many times now did they mention Jaime and the Hand of the King job? how did I miss this in my first views of the show? I was actually shocked. I think the show was giving us some hints about the end right in season 1.

* S1E7 - Tywin is introduced in that awesome scene with the dead stag and in that scene he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. Jaime now in season 7 is finally taking back his life and becoming the hero we all expect him to be.

Jaime completely outsmarted Tyrion in season 7 using the mistakes he made in the past as a lesson. Jaime and Jon were literally the two leaders on season 7 trying to save their people from unecessary deaths. He went to Cersei to tells her that they couldnt win against Dragons, he wanted her to surrender to Dany to save the lives of his armies and his people; he decided to abandon her to go fight North and save the realm. He is finally becoming the man he is supposed to be. 

And that quote from Jon in season 7 also made me think of him and Jaime ""my father used to say, we find our true friends in the battlefield"". I think Jon and Jaime will forge a nice relationship in season 8 and Jon will need someone with experience in Kings Landing. Jaime lived his whole life in the capital and watched his father and Jon Arryn being hands of the king for decades. He will help Jon to be a better king.

Also, remember Jon and Tyrion were friends of summer; Jaime and Jon will become frinds during winter. **“Summer friends will melt away like summer snows, but winter friends are friends forever.”**

"[SPOILERS] The Game of Faces, the scenes that were misinterpreted greatly.","I have read all the complaints of the Arya and Sansa scenes in Season 7, and I think some viewers have interpreted it differently. I don't mean to say my interpretation was the correct one, but my reading and understanding of their interactions made actual sense.

Arya and Sansa have never gotten along since the beginning. She blamed her to what happened to Mycah (actual quote, SE1E3, ""You're a liar, and if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive""), just like she very much hated The Hound back then and wanted him dead. Except she had gotten to know Sandor Clegane throughout their journeys, and had grown to not hate him anymore (evidence: S5E6, when Jaqen and Arya played the Game of Faces).

The keywords here are the ""Game of Faces."" *Arya: ""I don't want to play this stupid game anymore."" Jaqen: ""We never stop playing."" —SE5E6*

When they finally reunited, Arya was still cold and untrusting. But Sansa, who smiled when the guards told her about her sister, was more warm and excited. Their reunion was distant and met with brief silence and awkwardness (unlike Jon and Sansa—because Jon is more kind-hearted and forgiving, whereas Sansa finally felt safe), but despite that, Sansa was the one who came to her and hug her first. Arya didn't touch her on their first hug. But the second hug, after they talked again, was where Arya finally made peace. She finally hugged Sansa.

In the next scene, Arya and Bran talked about Arya's list of names she wanted to kill and the dagger that belonged to Littlefinger. Sansa's reaction about Arya's list gave her unease and discomfort (she knows Arya hated her before, so she was concerned if she was on her list). Then Sansa mentioned that Littlefinger wouldn't give the dagger if he didn't need something. This gave Arya suspicion about Littlefinger and his motive. (Remember, Arya didn't know anything about Littlefinger, only us viewers. She only met her at the tourney when he told Sansa the story about The Hound—and at Harrenhal with Tywin.)

Next: Arya's sparring with Brienne. Sansa is looking down, observing her sister's remarkable skill and was slightly concerned (still wondering if she was on her little list), and Arya, after the spar, looking up, suspecting Littlefinger once again. 

Next episode (Eastwatch), Arya observed Sansa governing, then later asked her why she didn't defend Jon against the Lords who was complaining about his absence. Arya thought killing them would be more reasonable because they insult Jon, who is the King, while Sansa thought listening to their complaints is what being a good leader is. (Remember when Bran was ruling Winterfell and he didn't like the old guy talking about Robb, who was the King in the North. Arya had the same approach in terms of ruling with Bran, defend their own family.) Keep in mind, Sansa is more a politician than Arya, had learned the basics of governing through Cersei (Blackwater episode) and also the art of lying—through Littlefinger (Sansa's confession at the Eyrie). From here on, up to the Beyond the Wall episode, Arya wants to know everything, wants to know who is lying and who can be trusted. Arya, who doesn't know anything about ruling, who only knows about killing and death, who is serving the Many-Faced God, is now trying to test Sansa (and Littlefinger) about her (their) real motives.

Next scene: Arya is spying on Littlefinger. But he noticed her spying, so he tricked Arya, as Petyr Baelish is the master of this. I truly believe Littlefinger tricked Ayra. She doesn't know anything about Sansa and what happened to her since they got separated. Her last memory/meeting with her was when Sansa told their father she wanted to marry Joffrey (""Seven hells!""). She truly believed Sansa wrote that letter, but... now that she is a Faceless Man, she wanted to test Sansa if she's trustworthy and telling the truth. So she played ""The Game of Faces"" with her. That's right, the next episode (Beyond the Wall), the courtyard scene, she was already playing the Game of Faces with her. She told Sansa a story about shooting an arrow over and over, while Ned was looking on that same balcony. I think this story was true (she was a good archer, hit a bullseye in the very first episode while Bran was practicing), but then she inserted a statement that Sansa helped the Lannisters killed their father. Making Sansa replied, ""What?"" The exact same response by Arya when the Waif asked her if the story she told was the truth or a lie (Arya replied ""What?"" and the Waif just walked away because Arya couldn't tell yet what are the truth and lies of the story).

So they bickered back and forth. Sansa got annoyed and argued back. This become a heated argument. This made Sansa worried about her sister, a girl who has a list to kill. But for Arya, it's just a game. Then Littlefinger, who orchestrated this plan to make the sisters fight (like what he did to Catelyn and Lysa), came to Sansa after the fight—or Sansa reached to him for some advise. Either way, they both talked about Arya. Littlefinger is always nosy. And this is where Littlefinger manipulates Sansa, telling her a Faceless Man is very dangerous.

Next scene, Sansa went to Arya's room to check up on her things where she found the faces. The weird faces made Sansa very afraid (that's why she quickly told Arya she has guards outside willing to protect her). But Arya had already tested Sansa in the previous scene. She knew Sansa was genuine to her but still afraid. She knew Sansa didn't betray their father. So she told her about ""The Game of Faces,"" and played the game once again (""We never stop playing"") to demonstrate and show Sansa that Arya, too, will never betray nor kill her own family. She told another story about she wanted to become the Lady of Winterfell (which is clearly a lie) while pretending to threaten her with the dagger. Sansa knew this statement was a lie, and that's why Arya handed the dagger to her because Arya lost the game. Arya explains that whoever caught a lie in their story would win. Giving the dagger also symbolizes she now trusts Sansa, and by telling her a lying statement about wanting to become the Lady of Winterfell, it also gives her a clue about Littlefinger's manipulation—that if ever Littlefinger mentions this statement to Sansa, she'd know he is lying.

Furthermore, Arya already knew the letter was a trick—purely based on Sansa's testimony about the letter earlier. (Also, Arya is still spying Littlefinger, the scenes where she follows Littlefinger didn't stop, she never stops spying, just like she never stops playing the Game of Faces.) The next episode, Littlefinger mentioned the lie again, and there Sansa realized Arya was genuine all along, that she will never betray her and her family.

And that's where the trial of Littlefinger begun. They now already know Littlefinger is a liar, who tricked them to fight one another, but they wanted to know more about it, and at this moment is where they thought about why Littlefinger gave the dagger to Bran, so they reached to Bran off-screen, and there they discovered more about Littlefinger's lies and treachery, and this is also why we see the dagger back into Arya's possession again. They met together to have Littlefinger be executed, for betraying their father that led him to death, but they wanted to trick him, just like how he tricked their father, so they called for a trial, a supposed Arya's trial, but really for Littlefinger.

Their scenes, interactions, and motives made sense to me. Their actions and arguments to each other made sense. And this is why I didn't have a problem with their story. And made the Littlefinger trial scene and the ending scene (""The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives"") even more emotional and impactful for me.",gameofthrones,True,1529945365,2018-06-25

[Benioff and Weiss](http://screenrant.com/game-of-thrones-final-season-7-8/) hope Martin pulls through, but are willing to move forward without him, books or not.

[SPOILERS] Question about Targaryans burning.,"So, obviously Dany is “The Unburnt.” And Viserys was killed with the melted gold poured on his head.  
  
So what gives a Targaryan the ability to not be burnt? Because I’m rewatching the series, and Jon burns his hand on a lantern when he tries to kill the Wight attacking him. So does he not have this ability as well, or did the directors just not know who he was yet?Obviously not all Targaryans have that ability, as seen with Viserys, but I was just wondering if there were others than couldn’t be burnt.

[Spoilers] I just watched the red wedding and I have to say...,"Meh, it was overhyped. My least favorite episode actually.

I knew a lot of people would die, so none of the deaths susprised me. But it was worse an that. I though so many more people would die. People constantly compared this event to others events in works of fiction where a lot of people die. So I though I would experience a bloodbath. Instead only three people and one dog died. Dissapotment.

Also, all these deaths or for nothing more than for shock value. I'm not going to get invested in any of these characters if they keep killing them off for no reason.

[SPOILERS] Thoughts on the changes made to the White Walkers?,"I have seen it mentioned but not much in the way of theory on why GoT showrunners changed so much about the White Walkers compared to the books. GrrM is now heavily involved (it seems more like he was in the early days of the GoT show) with Jane Goldman on a potential prequel that would delve heavily into the origins of the White Walkers. Could he address some of the changes and bring the two visions together? 

Based on how other adaptions have been made, the world GoT was originally produced in is much different than it is now in my opinion. Creators and ""universes"" adaptions are being made with increased attention to detail as they are noticing that this results in a better received product by analytical fanbases online. No one really deserves to have their vision be delivered in its purest form more than George RR Martin. So considering the WW were heavily changed and the prequel will feature the Long Night and their origins I think we could get a reconciliation from the origin in the books (when delivered) to the show.  

One last ""theory"" is that not only did the showrunners ""streamline"" the WW but I wonder if they left out some of GrrM final books twists from GoT final season. Will the prequel show have some of the surprise flashbacks the last two books may feature thus preserving some of the shocks from those books? Did they look at the narrative and come to the conclusion that some of the flashbacks in the last books that explain the Starks and WW were so epic they could be their own show and in pulling them out and making them a show that won't come out for years give him the time to finish his books with these surprises in them (hopefully)?

-- According to George R. R. Martin, the Others ""are strange, beautiful… think, oh… the Sidhe made of ice, something like that… a different sort of life… inhuman, elegant, dangerous.""[5] --

-- The blood of old Valyria is often manifested by eyes in shades of purple, and hair of silver-gold or platinum white. --

In many ways the Others are more like frozen Targs to me than zombie warriors. There is also the origin of the seduction of the Night King with the Night Queen which was omitted and I wonder why beyond ""streamlining"" which doesn't seem like enough of a reason. Much has been removed and replaced with the mysterious show Night King. Just wondering what others might be thinking of the Others changes...

A lot of people hold onto the prophecy of her only ever having 3 children, and arguing that the prophecy is technically broken in the show because she apparently had a 4th child with Robert that died in infancy, but I was wondering if that child was actually Cersei’s? I remember somewhere in Season 1 she mentioned that Robert would never actually be present while she went into labour, so is it possible that she aborted Robert’s child while he was away and staged the death of another newborn child to avoid suspicion from Robert?

[SPOILERS] Why was the Nights Watch in such a bad state at the beginning on the first book?,"Hi all, (disclaimer: sorry if this question has already been answered or is really obvious)

At the start of the first book, how comes the Nights Watch was in such a bad state

Firstly, the kingdom has been through a period of relative peace, with a long summer. There should have been surpluses of money and men that could be sent to the wall.

Secondly, Ned had been ruler of the north for over a decade. He showed great respect for the Nights Watch. He would have known about their situation better than anyone as his brother was first ranger. Ned would have had the kings ear. Surely he would have had some influence with the king/other rulers in westeros. 

Thirdly, the kings hand had been jon arynn, a sensible hand who would have listened to requests from the Nights Watch/Ned

I would understand if there wasn't a lot of money to be sent north as king Robert spent a lot and may not have valued the Nights Watch, but surely they could have made a deal for prisoners to be sent north.

With Ned being such a respected ruler, and him holding the wall in such high regard, why did that not rub off on to other leaders, with them sending bastard sons off to live an honourable life.

[SPOILERS] Who runs each Kingdom when the curtain drops?,"Whilst I haven't got a clue how the story will end I'm pretty certain that Westeros will end up at peace with a stable government. To that end I thought I'd speculate about who's left running things when the dust settles.

Dorne - The only Dornish character alive in the show is Elaria Sand who should still be in a cell in King's Landing. Tyrion hates her for killing his neice but it might be good diplomacy to put her in charge.

Iron Islands - It's either Euron, Theon or Yara. Yara is the obvious choice but putting Theon in charge as a puppet of King's Landing would be more interesting politically.

The Reach - With the Tyrells wiped out it is likely that the Reach will be awarded to someone who's served our heroes with distinction. I'd really like it if Bron or Greyworm was given it.

The Westerlands - Cersai won't survive and i think Jamie will reject it, that leaves Tyrion to rule as Warden of the West.

Stormlands - Gendry will likely be legitimised and given the Stormlands.

The Vale - Robin Arryn is the only choice.

The Riverlands - Edmund Tully will be lord of the Riverlands.

The North - Almost certainly Sansa as Bran will be off being a Raven. It won't be Jon as he's a Targaryan not a Stark.

Lord Commander of the Night's Watch - Step forward Jamie Lannister who will take the Black after killing his sister.

The Iron Throne -  The big one, it's either Jon, Dany or their child. I don't think Jon will get it, I'd pay good money that he doesn't survive the show. I also wouldn't be surprised if Dany doesn't get it so my money is that their son will be in charge with Varys acting as Viceroy until the child comes of age.

[SPOILERS] The Gist of Season 8,"So you may be asking, what's the point of R+L=J when the message of the story is that relying on hierarchies, blood right and prophecies is insane?

Well, it's so Daenerys and Jon could fight in Season 8.

Now that might sound really hypothetical, but think about this: in S7 Lyanna says Jon's name is Aegon. Now Aegon (Blackfyre) is the guy setup to clash with Dany in the 2nd Dance of the Dragons in the books. DnD renaming Jon is basically them showing their ""combining characters"" strategy to the fans.

And we should keep in mind that a Targaryen's arrival to the North will NOT go over smoothly...

BUT THE OTHERS!

Well that I leave up to you. The showrunnes cannot logically resolve the Others thanks to omitting stuff from the books. Supposing they try to get the same message across - which is the Others are only as good or bad as humans themselves, we could either see a peace deal or total death of both sides... which I don't think is likely considering the drama around the 'bittersweet ending'. The Others need to mate with humans to survive or per show cannon need human babies, so killing everyone does not make sense.

So expect some dragon on dragon action, just not the undead one and the big black one.

You can quite clearly see that all the dead are avoiding the broken pieces of the wall, is that because it would simply be hard for them to walk over or are the pieces of the wall still imbued by some of their original magic which can in turn be used against them ?

[Spoilers] A Rant about Arya,"Watched all the seven seasons of Game of Thrones TV show recently, and one of the things, that bugs me, is Arya. Now, I am probably going to get quite some hate, as most seem to be completely in love with that character. For me though, it's the opposite - I can barely stand her.

At first I thought her story was going to be interesting, but quite soon after Arya's leaving of King's Landing, her entire story has gone down like a rock, starting with Arya in Harrenhal, where she proves to be in many ways more competent than Tywin's commanders, who probably worked as  commanders for longer than Arya lived. Hardly even Arya's noble birth explains this.

Another thing is Arya's behaviour while travelling with Brotherhood with no Banners and with the Hound. In both times, Arya was acting like a rude, obnoxious, annoying brat, who also put Hound in danger several times. And despite that, everyone (including the Hound, who just got rid of another brat) treated her like a proper princess. And the thing is, that Arya was constantly in danger, as she was just a little girl. The smart way to act would be to keep her head down, be quiet and obedient, so she wouldn't draw attention, and act covertly. But she did the opposite of that. And despite all of this, everything went swimmingly for her.

Next comes Arya's time in The House of Black and White, where, despite Arya basically doing the exact opposite of what Jaqen tells her to, she still succeeds to become ""nobody"", at (probably) a record time, as well. At this point, I expected to see Arya fail, because, obviously, she could not let go of her past. And, I thought, her time with Jaqen would help her realize, that she is not ""nobody"", nor should she try to become that. But no, the show simply could not have Arya fail at anything. And thus, now Arya also has the massive Deus ex machina, that is the power of face-changing. Like, this convenient power can basically be used to get away with all kinds of nonsense, and, of course, it will be. Not to mention, that now Arya is even more God-like.

And now, after Arya comes back home, she's such a perfect warrior, that she defeats Brianne... Of Tarth... Two things about this:

\&gt; It's never really shown how exactly Arya acquires such swordsmanship skills. Syrio does not explain this, as even after his training, Arya was a noob.

\&gt; Regardless of training, Arya is still a little girl. There is no way in the world she would stand a chance against Armoured Brienne. It's like fighting an armoured giant for her. And she had a bloody short-sword of all things! Brienne would win 10 times out of 10, with Arya never landing a hit, if this was reality. 

I could accept it if Arya was an assassin type character, who avoided direct confrontation, because she knew she couldn't win. But this... This is ridiculous. I thought Game of Thrones was supposed to be realistic (excluding all the magic, dragons, etc.).",gameofthrones,True,1530255460,2018-06-29
[Spoilers] Jorah's and Rakharo's conversation in Season One,"I was wondering if anyone else is bothered by this:

&gt;""&lt;...&gt;That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.&lt;...&gt;""

For one, Jorah is holding a longsword there. And a longsword typically weighs around 1,5 kg. It is a fast, agile and elegant weapon. Not some club with a sharp point, which the show implies. There is no way in the world it would ever pierce plate armour. If it did, what would be the point of armour? And indeed, Jorah contradicts himself immediately after:

&gt;""&lt;...&gt;Amour makes a man slow. It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.&lt;...&gt;"".

If a simple longsword could pierce plate armour (which we actually see multiple times in the show), it doesn't exactly ""help to keep a man alive"".

By the way, talking about plate armour - yes, it was heavier than regular clothing. But no, it wasn't heavy enough to prevent quick movement. In fact, it is possible to do many types of sports wearing full plate armour. ",gameofthrones,True,1530257173,2018-06-29

[Spoilers] The Crossroads Decision,"I don't think there is any decision that is more maligned and misunderstood among the fandom than the one Catelyn made at the Crossroads Inn. The one where she arrests Tyrion. It is widely regarded as the beginning of the end for House Stark and Catelyn is blamed for it because, according to a lot of fandom, she played right into Littlefinger's hands by making a stupid, impetuous decision with no regard for consequences. And even if House Stark had prevailed, people still blame her for all the death and destruction caused by the war because they see the consequences here as both necessary and foreseeable. 

Now, I've argued against this assessment quite a few point, but here I'd like to point out 3 major aspects in which the fans get it wrong. 3 things that people mostly take for granted, but where a deeper examination of the story reveals that the opposite is true. 


**Catelyn played right into Littlefinger's hands:** For some reason, quite a few people seem to believe that LF knew that Catelyn would arrest Tyrion and that's why he named him as the owner of the blade. This is completely incorrect. 

To begin with, Tyrion's arrest could've only happened in that specific set of circumstances - they had to meet at the Crossroads Inn surrounded by Tully bannermen and Tyrion had to recognize her. The chances of that were a million to one. Unless LF is a greenseer, he could not have known that this would happen. Catelyn herself showed absolutely no inclination to confront Tyrion before he recognized her. Had they simply passed each-other on the road, nothing would've happened. Its simply impossible that LF could've planned for this. 

But did Cat still play into his hands? Did LF catch a lucky break here? I'd argue the opposite. Baelish lied about the dagger - so its in his best interest that the Starks simply believe him but don't pursue the investigation any further. This chance meeting had the potential to unravel all his schemes. Had Ned not been wounded and Robert returned from the hunt, the truth about the dagger *would've* come to light and Baelish would be done. Catelyn meeting Tyrion was actually a very unlucky break for him - one that had to be counterbalanced with the lucky break of Robert's death. 


**Catelyn made an instinctive, impetuous choice based on her emotions:** Catelyn haters love to paint her as irrational, emotional and short-sighted and this action of hers is one they love to point to as an example. But was this decision really that irrational?

Consider how well she executes the arrest despite having no any time to plan it - securing her fathers' bannermen's overwhelming support to get it done without any bloodshed. These are not actions of an impetuous woman. 

And the arrest itself wasn't her first instinct. Look at these bits from the chapter:

&gt;“Oh, gods,” Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him, her fingers tightening hard around his forearm.

&gt;The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them

&gt;His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away…and found Catelyn. He looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf was smiling. 

&gt;If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if only…

Clearly, Catelyn is trying to hide and avoid being recognized here. And for good reason. Ned is deep in Lannister territory and investigating them. It'd not serve at all for Lannisters to know that he is onto them - they might kill him like they killed Jon Arryn. Once Tyrion got back with the story of Cat's secret visit to King's Landing, the Lannisters would put it together and know that Ned was on to them. Remaining unknown was the best possible outcome here, but once Tyrion spotted her, that was no longer an option. 

She had to do some really quick thinking here. She could've fed Tyrion some story, but there was no story that would've made a lady of her station traveling incognito with only one old retainer any less suspicious. The conspiracy was going to come to light anyway - arresting Tyrion, however, forces it to come to light on her terms, not the Lannisters'. And now she has a hostage in case the Lannisters make a move against Ned. 

Given the short time she had to make this decision, I'd say she made quite a smart move. It was risky, yes, but doing nothing would've been even more risky. 


**Catelyn should've seen Tywin's response coming:** This is a pretty important one - was starting a war the appropriate and reasonable response to Tyrion's arrest? Was it a response to be expected of Tywin Lannister?

I've often argued that Tywin's action here were a major overreaction - and a very stupid one at that. Had Tywin responded pragmatically and with a level head, he'd have achieved a lot more while sacrificing a lot less. Had he gone to Robert for justice, Catelyn would've been forced to release Tyrion and the Starks would've been humiliated for making such a stupid mistake. Ned would've been likely dismissed as Hand with Tywin becoming his likely replacement. 

Starting a war on the other hand risked everything. Robert would not have simply overlooked breaking the king's peace and Tywin was in no position to face off against the power of the Iron Throne. Tywin certainly did not think his actions through and he got really lucky that Robert's convenient death allowed him to escape the consequences. 

But don't take my word for it - take Tyrion's. Here's the excerpt from his chapter when he languishes in the Sky Cells of Eyrie. 

&gt;He wondered what Cersei would do when she heard....

&gt;**If Cersei kept her wits about her, she would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion himself.** Even Ned Stark could scarcely object to that, not without impugning the honor of the king. And Tyrion would be only too glad to take his chances in a trial. Whatever murders they might lay at his door, the Starks had no proof of anything so far as he could see. **Let them make their case before the Iron Throne and the lords of the land. It would be the end of them. If only Cersei were clever enough to see that…**

&gt;Tyrion Lannister sighed. **His sister was not without a certain low cunning, but her pride blinded her. She would see the insult in this, not the opportunity.** And Jaime was even worse, rash and headstrong and quick to anger. His brother never untied a knot when he could slash it in two with his sword.


Tyrion says nothing about what his father would do apart from sending riders after them, but his comments about the most pragmatic course of action here applies to Tywin as well. Despite being the one imprisoned, he sees that the smartest choice here is to have Robert sit judgment on the matter. He simply doesn't trust Jaime or Cersei to be smart enough to see that. 


But shouldn't Tywin be smarter? He is well known in the Seven Kingdoms to be pragmatic, cautious and cunning. So why would anyone expect him to be like Cersei - blinded by pride and seeing the insult, not the opportunity? Why would anyone expect him to react like Jaime - rushing to action without considering the consequences? Turns out, Tywin ended up being worse than either of them. But if Tyrion didn't expect this reaction from Tywin, why should Catelyn?


**TL;DR:** A more nuanced reading of the text shows that arresting Tyrion at the Crossroads was perhaps the smartest choice Catelyn could've made at the moment. It spiraled out of control partly because of unexpected actions by others and mostly because fate (GRRM) was conspiring against the Starks - but the blame for that cannot be laid at Catelyn's feet.

[SPOILERS] Question about S1E8 “The Pointy End” and Ned’s “mercy”,"So I’ve been rewatching the series and I noticed something I hadn’t the first time around. When Varys visits Ned in the dungeon in “The Pointy End,” he asks why Ned would tell Cersei that he knew the secret about her and Jaime, and Ned replies that he was trying to show her and her children mercy, because Robert would certainly kill them all when he found out. Varys replies that this mercy is what killed Robert, which I always took to mean that Cersei had a hand in killing Robert, which she pretty much admits to later on when she tortures that Septa. (I guess by making sure Lancel gave him tons of wine, so he’d be slow and more likely to get hurt?)

But, Ned doesn’t tell Cersei he knows about her and Jaime until the previous episode, “You Win or You Die.” By then, Robert had already left on his hunting trip. If Cersei did have a hand in Robert’s death, she probably planned it out with Lancel before they left for the trip. So how did Ned warning Cersei out of mercy affect anything since Robert was already gone and his death was most likely already planned? Am I just misinterpreting what Varys meant here or is it a timing mistake by the writers? ",gameofthrones,True,1528761434,2018-06-11

Ok, I’m new to this and this is my first post, but here it goes. 

I was thinking today about Ned and his admission of guilt. What effect did his admission in front of the small folk have, if any?

Considering the mistreatment of lords by a king would break the feudal agreement that they all live under. So let’s say when Rickard and Brandon were killed this was seen as unjust amongst  the lords and would therefore impact their decision to join the rebel’s cause. 

So basically does anyone think that if Ned would not have admitted to treason would more lords have sided with Robb? And also would any of them been more reluctant to join the crown?",gameofthrones,True,1528764584,2018-06-11

[Spoilers] Watching GoT for the Nth time and I noticed an interesting parallel,"Apologies if this has been mentioned before but I was watching season 4 episode 5 *First Of His Name*, when it got to the fight between Jon and Karl Tanner. In the fight, Karl is duel wieldong daggers and proves himself to be Jon's better in fighting (regardless of the ""honor"" displayed). Jon is knocled down and appears to be ready for his doom when another player joins the fray amd stabs Karl in the back. Jon then recovers and finishes the job ( a la Tanner kebab).

[SPOILERS] Season 4 Tywin/Tyrion Relationship,"This question concerns Tywins death. Tywin clearly tries to defuse the situation using kind words and reason. But what inspired this question was that at one point during the scene, he stated that Tyrion was his son, a Lanniser, and that Tywin admired him. But at the end, his last words are ""You're no son of mine.""   So my question is, which of these contradicting statements from Tywin are true? Did he only say that he admired Tyrion as a lannister and son to calm him down, or was there some truth behind it? Did Tywins last words truly represent his feelings, or did he just say that because we was angry? ",gameofthrones,True,1528806320,2018-06-12

You Need Valyrian Steel To Kill Whatever Bran Is....,"So I watch a lot of GOT and ASOIAF videos on YouTube and for the most part I'm a silent part of the community but every now and then a video make me think of theories of my own and I'll post a comment....and crickets. So I posted this comment on a video about the catspaw dagger. I'm intrigued to get other people's opinions, even if they think I'm dead wrong. Here's the exact comment:

 TINFOIL AF but....what if you need Valyrian Steel to kill Bran? If you're sending a hired assassin, why send them with such an valuable weapon? He's a little boy. The right assassin could have killed him with just about anything. So, what if the person who sent the catspaw knows something none of us know yet. Whatever in him makes him the next 3\-eyed raven, has been in him since birth imo. Think like the Avatar. He or she was always the avatar, but just had to be trained. He's always been the raven, but had to be trained. So the person who sent it would have to know who and what he was and know that he had to be killed with Valyrian steel. Again, super tinfoil, but I figured I'd leave the comment.﻿ Thoughts? ",gameofthrones,True,1528830066,2018-06-12

[No Spoilers] A weird theory on the entire world of ASOIAF (Crackpot Theory),"It can be said that Westeros is an allegorical representation of Europe, and Essos is the representation of Asia. It is generally obvious that Yi Ti, being in the far East of the known world, is representing of some of the better-known East Asian Countries (China, Japan etc.) Even so, the Westerosi know very little about the Yi Tese (Yi T-ish? How do you say it?) this generally represents the amount of knowledge Europeans had of the Far East in midieval times, (ie none) Which brings me to the next point.

**Sothoryos is Africa**

Yes it's kind of obvious that Sothoryos is a representation of Africa. Th Europeans generally knew little about the continent other than the Northern Coast, yet that was inhospitable enough to where they didn't try any further colonization until much later. Sothoryos is said to be huge, having deserts and mountains along with it's northern jungles. It's practically screaming Africa. So now that we established the fact that Planetos (The entire world) is an allegorical representation of Earth, I started speculating about the other landmass below the Shadow Lands.

**Ulthos is Australia**

Now, before the disbelief, just know, this is a silly theory that has no basis in fact. I posted it for brainfood and entertainment. Now, ulthos looks like a jungle on the part we see on the official WOIAF map. take into account that on the coasts of Australia there are some rainforests. What I'm saying is, I theorize that most of Ulthos is a massive desert. to keep in the theme of an Australian-type continent. It is even in the same location in relation to Australia on the Real world map. Now time for the massive, most stupid part of the entire theory.

**There are two other continents across the Summer Sea**

Okay, that might be a stretch, nut it most definitely keeps in the theme of the Planetos map being an allegorical representation of the Real World map. There could definitely be a ""North and South America"" west of Westeros across the Summer Sea. No one has found anything yet, so it might be pretty far. But, who knows? this theory was for fun.

why i dislike daenerys so much,"for some reason i decided to share my opinion on dany (a lot of people thought at first that i like her) so yeah enjoy ig

so seasons 1,2 and 4 daenerys get a pass because she was ok in these seasons ig, even though i really liked her character only in season 1.

season 1 dany was very much her being her brother's sister. she did as he told, and through being married to drogo became exposed to more brutal, powerful side of life. it was through this new power that she was able to stand up to viserys, kill the witch that killed her unborn child and fucked with drogo,and inspired her to take charge in travelling to westeros and taking the iron throne. 
season 2 built upon this nicely, her whole travelling to qarth, trying to find ships etc. like season 1 she was engaging because she had real troubles to deal with.
then season 3 came along. this was the first instance of the writers pushing a dany agenda too strongly down the audience's throats. she became a lot less compelling this season because instead of real hardships and challenges, she just got whatever she wanted whenever she wanted. her taking of the unsullied army was ridiculously cheesy and unrealistic, i'm supposed to believe that killing the guy in charge is all it takes to acquire this huge ass army, and his murder was completely justified? i'm supposed to believe just saying ""you're all free,but you can fight for me if you want"" is all it takes to get the entire army to fight for her truly with passion? it felt like they were trying to make a perfect leader out of her by making her go on a liberation streak (which shouldn't be the only thing a perfect ruler does obviously). what i didn't like about this was that it was just her vs nameless bad guys. nothing compelling there,and no truth there too. good and bad on both sides, yet the scenes painted her as some perfect person. as if there are no ethical dilemmas with taking these cities. now granted, this didn't bother me TOO much, this is more a criticism of how the filming and music was done in season 3 to try and paint her as some wholly good jesus-like figure. the worst part was the finale, her being held up by a bunch of former slaves whilst cheesy music plays way too much oh god. (was rewatching recently so it's been really stuck in my head) that was the first of MANY cheesy scores to play during her scenes. 
season 4 was actually a massive improvement, i'd go as far as saying i kinda liked watching her in season 4. the show finally introduced some moral dilemmas of her actions, her crucifying of the masters, drogon killing livestock and children, former slaves not liking the new life she's forced them into, it was something compelling and interesting for a change. she made some mistakes, but she listened carefully to the advice of jorah and barristan, and managed to make the right decision regarding these matters. hizdahr was a good display of how the ""bad guys"" dany's been up against aren't all just bad guys. there was this great quote from jorah - ""it's tempting to see your enemies as evil,all of them. but there's good and bad on both sides of every war ever fought."" 
ending the season on her locking up the dragons away was nice, it showed her thinking like a ruler and it was an emotional moment. it was also through these experiences she decided to stay in meereen to improve herself as a ruler and a liberator.
season 5 comes along and shits all over this. i had high hopes that the sons of harpy would build upon her season 4 dilemmas in a way that would force her to become smarter about how she deals with people that don't support her. jorah's gone, and they kill off barristan too for some reason (well actually it's d&amp;d's fault, just won't be getting into it). first thing she does in response? feeds masters to her dragons. that was a huge insult to everything barristan stood for,during the whole sons of the harpy situation he was the one pushing for fair trials, not impulsive murders. then this season she just changes as a character, she keeps having lame ass speeches like the ""i'm going to break the wheel"" which sounds kinda cool for the trailer, but barely carry any actual weight. and as though season 4 didn't happen, she goes back to viewing all her enemies as evil. she now hates the masters again, and even worse she now starts to genuinely perceive herself to be an all perfect ruler. when tyrion comes into town, she seems shocked when tyrion even suggests that she may not be worth his service. i don't know why, but for some reason emilia clarke decided to take an entirely different route with playing daenerys this season too. this season she just puts on this expressionless face for nearly all her scenes that aren't deliberately trying to be emotional. detached me from her character a lot. she also became a lot more argumentative and irrational this season. then there's this issue with drogon. i loved the fact that as her dragons grew she could no longer control them, that felt real. but then for some reason drogon flies in, saves her and flies off with her on his back. there was just no build up on this scene so it felt flat. (but ig they went for that ""a pet will protect its owner when in danger"". idk why i'm trying to explain d&amp;d's poorly written scenes, fuck them)
and the whole trying-to-touch-his-nose thing all season was so lame too. but anyway, season 5 undid all her learnings from the previous season. 
up next is season 6, i'm really hoping it'll be a redemption for dany. being captured by dothraki, i'm hoping for a season 3 jaime-esque redemption arc, coz in season 5 she became very entitled. too entitled. i was hoping that being a captive would bring her back to reality,and remind her of her roots with the dothraki in season 1. the dothraki are after all a good facilitator of how there is good and bad on both sides. they were good for her in season 1, but bad to others. boi could i have been further from the truth. instead she's entitled as ever, boasting about her titles to the khal [whatever his name was] in the most ridiculous scene ever.
 then that scene where she burns the khals rolls around with her cringy speech. this is one of those areas that the show is deliberately not explaining. they need her to have a large army and needed to come up with some way to get her out of captivity so they killed two birds with one stone. but they know this can't stand up to scrutiny so it doesn't get any. once she simultaneously murdered all their leaders and desecrated their holy site all of the dothraki joined her. 
like it's that liberation of the unsullied army all over again. apparently dothraki follow strength so it's fine ahhh i fucking hate that tho. and i'm supposed to be happy for her? fucking hell. (the biggest unanswered questions is where are the women, children, and non-fighting aged men? if dany brought them with her that makes no sense. it's already nonsensical how she can provision her army, but if she has to feed an even larger amount of civilians as well it's beyond absurd. but if she left the civilians in essos, then that means she managed to convince all the men to abandon their families to certain enslavement since they would be completely defenseless.) 
so she finally gets back to meereen with her army, and how do we see dany deal with this threat to revolt in her city? she unleashes the dothraki horde to kill them all. real nice. and ofc there's all happy music and d&amp;d are like ""yeah be happy! isn't this awesome? she's solving the situation."" 
but even tho season 5 had faults it at least acknowledged that the sons of the harpy couldn't be dealt with just sheer violence. you can't kill ideas, killing all those people shouldn't have done shit, if anything it would've made things even worse. not to mention the dothraki are savages. but yet we're supposed to watch that and think ""wow isn't dany great?"". bullshit, that wasn't a thing a great ruler would do. she learned absolutely nothing from her time with the dothraki, and absolutely nothing more about ruling. and for some reason all the dragons that she had massive problems with are all perfectly tame now? they do exactly as she wants them to do because .. reasons? (i think i actually mentioned some cringy ass excuse somewhere in this rant already) perfect. it just felt like more and more shit getting handed to her because it's convenient for the plot. but there's nothing compelling about that. why would i want to watch the adventures of someone that just gets whatever they want with no consequences? a good example of the no consequences situation would also be the fact that they killed off tommen just so that danny wouldn't have the moral dilemma of having to overthrow a child, d&amp;d will really do anything for her, won't they? it pisses me off. i don't want to watch her vs just bad guys. i used to be excited at the prospect of her travelling to westeros because i acknowledged it would be her versus other good people for a change, but the show just went and fucked all that didn't it? guess they couldn't risk dany looking bad in any sort of way. it'll be the same with cersei if she does give birth to her new child. she'll spare her or they're just gonna have cersei miscarry the child.
so yeah for some reason at the end of the season 6 she's like ""i'm ready now, i'm totally a competent ruler now"" yet she showed no evidence of having learned anything. if anything she became worse.
another thing to add to season 6 is that yeah of course the season ends on her getting greyjoy support, tyrell support and dornish support. as if she wasn't overpowered enough already. i seriously don't understand why they think we wanna see some overpowered person just get the support they need easy peasy. no controversy? the closest we got to controversy tbf was randyll and dickon's death in season 7. i liked that they put tyrion and dany on the spot.
season 7 rocks about and she's now pushing this narrative that she's taking the 7 kingdoms because she wants to help the people. are you fucking kidding me? if you cared about people you'd have stayed in essos and ensured slavery actually ended. you wanna fight oppression? there's your oppression. but i guess if she just admitted she was there to conquer it would make her look bad? well done d&amp;d. this season she's just portrayed as the perfect person that believes everything she does is right and moral, when it isn't. she justifies everything because she just thinks everyone that's against her is evil. that annoys me. and to build onto to what i was saying about her in season 5, emilia clarke's acting has just gone for some reason. like i believe she can act, but it's like she chooses not to in these later seasons and it's so frustrating to watch. or maybe it's just d&amp;d's fault, they're giving her the instructions on how to portray her character (? man why am i trying to defend her). but yeah overall i just can't stand d&amp;d trying to make everything super easy for her, painting everyone that's against her as evil and her as always justified, her long cringey speeches, and her sense of entitlement. you didn't see seasons 1-4 dany saying she'd take the 7 kingdoms in order to help the people i mean come on. she's just lost all the compelling traits and it sucks. to be perfectly honest i just see her now as catfood for feminists. she's supposedly perfect, she's supposedly powerful, she talks some smack, and she makes speeches. all without the grit that makes a character interesting. yet somehow she gets shitload of screentime. oh right d&amp;d we get it, she's yo fav.
and then we have daenerys doing the following for her allies: 
yara ignored 
ellaria ignored
olenna dead 
(with no word about losing them on a personal level)
berating tyrion publicly and questioning his loyalties more than once
threatening to burn varys alive (who delivered dany the dornish and tyrells)
holding her only (and newest) ally prisoner on her island until he capitulated to her demands
delivered the dragon to the greatest enemy of the new ally, an enemy that ally came to her specifically to seek help in destroying
burned a large percentage of the food with an impending long night on the not-too-distant-horizon and 
wasted time brokering peace with someone who would have betrayed them anyway (no shade to cersei, i love the fact she did that)
ugh 

i defo rambled on here, so sorry if that's not my most coherent argument. it just annoys me how wrong they went with her arc after season 4 ended. like game of thrones wasn't all about people just fighting bad guys and getting what they want. it was about real conflict where there are no easy choices. real conflict where your enemies aren't just evil, and you have to question the morality of your own actions. real conflict usually for power. all of these themes have been stripped from dany's story and it sucks dicks. they can't even keep the power aspect since it's now just her taking over the westeros to benefit the people of westeros.

i just thought of another reason, but for me daenerys' story is the epitome of what i don't like about what the show has become. lack of complexity,lack of scheming,generic good vs evil,lack of emotional moments,plot armour,lack of moral conflict,cheese/cliche tropes,forced quotable lines (i swear half her speeches are just so they can have cool sounding words to put in trailers),too much magic, too many ex machinas. these are all things i find popping up in her story more than anyone else's, which ofc plays a big part of why i don't like watching her character on the show. i do believe her story didn't always suffer from these disadvantages,alas that is not the case anymore.",gameofthrones,True,1528878925,2018-06-13
What's your favorite scene in the Game of Thrones?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1528879312,2018-06-13
why i dislike daenerys so much [SPOILERS],"for some reason i decided to share my opinion on daenerys (people mostly think at first that i really like her) so enjoy ig

so seasons 1,2 and 4 daenerys get a pass because she was ok in these seasons ig, even though i really liked her character only in season 1.

season 1 dany was very much her being her brother's sister. she did as he told, and through being married to drogo became exposed to more brutal, powerful side of life. it was through this new power that she was able to stand up to viserys, kill the witch that killed her unborn child and fucked with drogo,and inspired her to take charge in travelling to westeros and taking the iron throne. 
season 2 built upon this nicely, her whole travelling to qarth, trying to find ships etc. like season 1 she was engaging because she had real troubles to deal with.
then season 3 came along. this was the first instance of the writers pushing a dany agenda too strongly down the audience's throats. she became a lot less compelling this season because instead of real hardships and challenges, she just got whatever she wanted whenever she wanted. her taking of the unsullied army was ridiculously cheesy and unrealistic, i'm supposed to believe that killing the guy in charge is all it takes to acquire this huge ass army, and his murder was completely justified? i'm supposed to believe just saying ""you're all free,but you can fight for me if you want"" is all it takes to get the entire army to fight for her truly with passion? it felt like they were trying to make a perfect leader out of her by making her go on a liberation streak (which shouldn't be the only thing a perfect ruler does obviously). what i didn't like about this was that it was just her vs nameless bad guys. nothing compelling there,and no truth there too. good and bad on both sides, yet the scenes painted her as some perfect person. as if there are no ethical dilemmas with taking these cities. now granted, this didn't bother me TOO much, this is more a criticism of how the filming and music was done in season 3 to try and paint her as some wholly good jesus-like figure. the worst part was the finale, her being held up by a bunch of former slaves whilst cheesy music plays way too much oh god. (was rewatching recently so it's been really stuck in my head) that was the first of MANY cheesy scores to play during her scenes. 
season 4 was actually a massive improvement, i'd go as far as saying i kinda liked watching her in season 4. the show finally introduced some moral dilemmas of her actions, her crucifying of the masters, drogon killing livestock and children, former slaves not liking the new life she's forced them into, it was something compelling and interesting for a change. she made some mistakes, but she listened carefully to the advice of jorah and barristan, and managed to make the right decision regarding these matters. hizdahr was a good display of how the ""bad guys"" dany's been up against aren't all just bad guys. there was this great quote from jorah - ""it's tempting to see your enemies as evil,all of them. but there's good and bad on both sides of every war ever fought."" 
ending the season on her locking up the dragons away was nice, it showed her thinking like a ruler and it was an emotional moment. it was also through these experiences she decided to stay in meereen to improve herself as a ruler and a liberator.
season 5 comes along and shits all over this. i had high hopes that the sons of harpy would build upon her season 4 dilemmas in a way that would force her to become smarter about how she deals with people that don't support her. jorah's gone, and they kill off barristan too for some reason (well actually it's d&amp;d's fault, just won't be getting into it). first thing she does in response? feeds masters to her dragons. that was a huge insult to everything barristan stood for,during the whole sons of the harpy situation he was the one pushing for fair trials, not impulsive murders. then this season she just changes as a character, she keeps having lame ass speeches like the ""i'm going to break the wheel"" which sounds kinda cool for the trailer, but barely carry any actual weight. and as though season 4 didn't happen, she goes back to viewing all her enemies as evil. she now hates the masters again, and even worse she now starts to genuinely perceive herself to be an all perfect ruler. when tyrion comes into town, she seems shocked when tyrion even suggests that she may not be worth his service. i don't know why, but for some reason emilia clarke decided to take an entirely different route with playing daenerys this season too. this season she just puts on this expressionless face for nearly all her scenes that aren't deliberately trying to be emotional. detached me from her character a lot. she also became a lot more argumentative and irrational this season. then there's this issue with drogon. i loved the fact that as her dragons grew she could no longer control them, that felt real. but then for some reason drogon flies in, saves her and flies off with her on his back. there was just no build up on this scene so it felt flat. (but ig they went for that ""a pet will protect its owner when in danger"". idk why i'm trying to explain d&amp;d's poorly written scenes, fuck them)
and the whole trying-to-touch-his-nose thing all season was so lame too. but anyway, season 5 undid all her learnings from the previous season. 
up next is season 6, i'm really hoping it'll be a redemption for dany. being captured by dothraki, i'm hoping for a season 3 jaime-esque redemption arc, coz in season 5 she became very entitled. too entitled. i was hoping that being a captive would bring her back to reality,and remind her of her roots with the dothraki in season 1. the dothraki are after all a good facilitator of how there is good and bad on both sides. they were good for her in season 1, but bad to others. boi could i have been further from the truth. instead she's entitled as ever, boasting about her titles to the khal [whatever his name was] in the most ridiculous scene ever.
 then that scene where she burns the khals rolls around with her cringy speech. this is one of those areas that the show is deliberately not explaining. they need her to have a large army and needed to come up with some way to get her out of captivity so they killed two birds with one stone. but they know this can't stand up to scrutiny so it doesn't get any. once she simultaneously murdered all their leaders and desecrated their holy site all of the dothraki joined her. 
like it's that liberation of the unsullied army all over again. apparently dothraki follow strength so it's fine ahhh i fucking hate that tho. and i'm supposed to be happy for her? fucking hell. (the biggest unanswered questions is where are the women, children, and non-fighting aged men? if dany brought them with her that makes no sense. it's already nonsensical how she can provision her army, but if she has to feed an even larger amount of civilians as well it's beyond absurd. but if she left the civilians in essos, then that means she managed to convince all the men to abandon their families to certain enslavement since they would be completely defenseless.) 
so she finally gets back to meereen with her army, and how do we see dany deal with this threat to revolt in her city? she unleashes the dothraki horde to kill them all. real nice. and ofc there's all happy music and d&amp;d are like ""yeah be happy! isn't this awesome? she's solving the situation."" 
but even tho season 5 had faults it at least acknowledged that the sons of the harpy couldn't be dealt with just sheer violence. you can't kill ideas, killing all those people shouldn't have done shit, if anything it would've made things even worse. not to mention the dothraki are savages. but yet we're supposed to watch that and think ""wow isn't dany great?"". bullshit, that wasn't a thing a great ruler would do. she learned absolutely nothing from her time with the dothraki, and absolutely nothing more about ruling. and for some reason all the dragons that she had massive problems with are all perfectly tame now? they do exactly as she wants them to do because .. reasons? (i think i actually mentioned some cringy ass excuse somewhere in this rant already) perfect. it just felt like more and more shit getting handed to her because it's convenient for the plot. but there's nothing compelling about that. why would i want to watch the adventures of someone that just gets whatever they want with no consequences? a good example of the no consequences situation would also be the fact that they killed off tommen just so that danny wouldn't have the moral dilemma of having to overthrow a child, d&amp;d will really do anything for her, won't they? it pisses me off. i don't want to watch her vs just bad guys. i used to be excited at the prospect of her travelling to westeros because i acknowledged it would be her versus other good people for a change, but the show just went and fucked all that didn't it? guess they couldn't risk dany looking bad in any sort of way. it'll be the same with cersei if she does give birth to her new child. she'll spare her or they're just gonna have cersei miscarry the child.
so yeah for some reason at the end of the season 6 she's like ""i'm ready now, i'm totally a competent ruler now"" yet she showed no evidence of having learned anything. if anything she became worse.
another thing to add to season 6 is that yeah of course the season ends on her getting greyjoy support, tyrell support and dornish support. as if she wasn't overpowered enough already. i seriously don't understand why they think we wanna see some overpowered person just get the support they need easy peasy. no controversy? the closest we got to controversy tbf was randyll and dickon's death in season 7. i liked that they put tyrion and dany on the spot.

i defo rambled on here, so sorry if that's not my most coherent argument. it just annoys me how wrong they went with her arc after season 4 ended. like game of thrones wasn't all about people just fighting bad guys and getting what they want. it was about real conflict where there are no easy choices. real conflict where your enemies aren't just evil, and you have to question the morality of your own actions. real conflict usually for power. all of these themes have been stripped from dany's story and it sucks dicks. they can't even keep the power aspect since it's now just her taking over the westeros to benefit the people of westeros.

i just thought of another reason, but for me daenerys' story is the epitome of what i don't like about what the show has become. lack of complexity,lack of scheming,generic good vs evil,lack of emotional moments,plot armour,lack of moral conflict,cheese/cliche tropes,forced quotable lines (i swear half her speeches are just so they can have cool sounding words to put in trailers),too much magic, too many ex machinas. these are all things i find popping up in her story more than anyone else's, which ofc plays a big part of why i don't like watching her character on the show. i do believe her story didn't always suffer from these disadvantages,alas that is not the case anymore.",gameofthrones,True,1528883322,2018-06-13
[Spoilers] Question about season 8 timeline,"Since season 7 ended I promised myself I'd avoid all season 8 news until it comes out. Wanted to be completely ignorant going into the final season of this show. And I've done well in avoiding that information so far, only accidentally seeing that there may be a WW battle at Winterfell and apparently the final shot of Dany is supposed to be a shot of her arm. I'm fine with that.

But I've obviously come across the news that we'll be waiting until 2019 for it to release. And I also know they're sort of close to wrapping up shooting. So has there been any news released or does anyone have an educated estimate as to when in 2019 season 8 will be airing? Are we talking January/in winter or will it be delayed until spring/summer like season 7 was?

TIA",gameofthrones,True,1528889840,2018-06-13

"[SPOILERS] - So Many End Game Theory Attempts, Let's have a Go Together","Okay I have noticed a lot of end game theories recently, people pushing theories and almost shoving them down our throats, some lost in total delusion of their favourite characters and others just small received theories without much attention. I want to try and break the main points we have to work out and see if we can have a go at it, I welcome all criticism and admit I do not have the answers but if we all take a bit on it we might get something good. Plus it's off season and I'm bored. 

* **Brans Power and the Power of the God's** - Many of you probably seperate the two but my thoughts on this that Bran is working through the God's as a means of communication, then being mistaken as an actual deity, here is a post I did before on it feel free to pick it apart like I've done to you lot https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8axrdc/spoilers_bran_stark_the_three_eyed_raven_and_the/ 

* **The First/Last battle** - OK we know that the last battle will be against either Cersei or The Night King. My thoughts on it are that The Night King has broken throught the wall, he may go to the Night's watch but I don't see the point in that, he won't care about 20 shitty warriors and I actually believe the NW will abandon the wall and head to alert Jon at Winterfell, we may have heard murmers of a battle but I don't want to be that guy but logically as I have been saying for a year the NK is heading to Winterfell and will be there quickly, the first battle will be against the army of the dead. Now that means they lose that battle or they win, they won't lose I don't think, but if they win then that leaves us with two options that A) The Night King is dead B) the loss was so bad that he had to retreat. So if he dies he dies and then it makes sense for whatever reason to go to war with Cersei. Let's discuss if he retreats, something very traumatic would have to happen for that guy to feel threatened into a retreat which I imagine is one of or a mix of 3 things which are Viserion being fully killed, huge losses, Bran hitting back at him. Maybe even all three. What do you guys think, will this be the first battle? Will the NK die? Will Jon or Dany? I for one think he will be made retreat and will show himself again at Kings Landing and take the million people there into his army. 

* **Euron/Theon** - I am convinced (on pure notion alone) that we will see a resolution to this in Essos. Theon has to get to Euron and presumably get past the GC, Daario is our only friend in Essos and I think they will hit a covert attack on the GC and Euron and they will never leave Essos. 

* **Valyrian Steel &amp; Lightbringer** - Ok we have 5 weapons left that are VS and they are with Arya, Jamie, Brienne, Jon, Sam there are also rumours of a certain PTWP carrying a dagger, a dagger that sounds very much like the one around Rhaegar's waist in the wedding scene but I am unclear weather it is VS or not. I am fascinated by the selection of heroes as I will call them who have the weapons and I do not think this is by accident. Maybe it's a sign that they are AA together (I don't believe that) or maybe it is by total chance, anyone got a good guess? I really do believe as you will see in my post about Bran that Bran handed Arya catspaw for a specific reason and that is to finish of the NK when the time comes, she has been trained as a master assassin and let go on Bran's command to Jaqen and she will kill the NK. Lightrbinger I don't know, perhaps it was melted down and formed into other weapons, perhaps it won't exist or as many of you think it might be Jon (I really hate the idea of Lightbringer being a person or mindset, or that we will have a last hero and AA a PTWP and a Lightbringer) but whatever we seen in those cave painting all I know is that Jamie Lannister has an important part to play but my money is on Jon to be our main ""hero"". 

* **King's Landing** - and by extension Cersei. Either the Night King will be dead by the time Jon get's to KL and a siege will happen, or else Cersei will take prisoners as some have speculated (I hope not because it would just be a forced Cleganebowl) but I have a feeling that Jon and co will be pushed from the North and go to KL out of necessity and may have to try and lay siege if Cersei won't allow them in and at that moment the WW will attack both armies. Leading to the streets filling with Wights and the city going boom boom. But then again that is all guesswork, any better? One thing I would love to see is a moment when Cersei realises that the NK is no joke and she has to face him or his armies, hell we might even see the Lannister forces move in on the survivors from Winterfell only to be taken by the NK and his army. Again all guesswork, but we are trying to put together a Jigsaw but we don't know what shape the pieces are. On a further note, will we have Cleganebowl? Who will set off the would be bomb? 

Jon's reveal, Who will sit atop the Iron Throne, who will rule, who will rule each kingdom, what is to become of the wall, who will marry who, who will die. All other questions you can answer now or if this post goes well I will attempt to make a proper post addressing those or any other topics and maybe we can get into a group discussion over all of this. Let's start with what I have so far, feel free to pick me apart and please try your best to answer and keep leaks under wraps.

Thanks

"[SPOILERS] 2 weeks ago I had never watched a single episode of GoT, after finishing all 67 episodes I can safety say this is one of my favourite shows.","When I started to watch the show beginning with season 1 I honestly thought that this was just an overrated money grab. However, the thing that made this shown unique to many of the others I have watched before is the randomness and surprise when the characters that are becoming well developed are suddenly killed. Looking at you Robb and Cat. 

I’m not going to write too much more because nobody wants to read a wall of text. From season 1 to 7 though I’ve been able to pick my favourite characters which have developed incredibly over each season. Arya, Sandor, Jaime, Tyrion, Bronn and of course the Targaryen siblings.

Really excited to watch the final season next year and I’m hoping the recently announced prequels will be great too. I haven’t looked into it much so I’m not sure what story they are focussing on there. I am personally hoping for them to focus on the Mad King and his dragons conquering Westeros.

Lyrics from genius.com

[Verse 1]
They made up their minds, and they started packing
And left before the sun came up that day
An exit to eternal summer slacking
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?
They drank up the wine and they got to talking
But now had more important things to say
And when the car broke down
They started walking
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
And never get hungry, never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home but they really don't care
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today

[Verse 2]
The children woke up, and they couldn't find them
They left before the sun came up that day
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
And never get hungry, never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home but they really don't care
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
And never get hungry, never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home but they really don't care
They wanted the highway, they're happier there today, today

Has the prequel changed the way we view GoT,"I can't help but think that the new prequel and the HBO statement that came with it has changed the way thrones might look. When they say there is a major twist to come, I really do think it will be to do with the WW and for it to really be something no one saw coming that may connect it with the prequel. The simple, bad guys are coming so the good guys will defeat them is defanatly not going to happen. As if we thought the story was complex enough, I think it's about to get cranked up to the max. I think season 8 will show us some sort of  connection to the planned sequel and change the way we have viewed the story this while time. The true origin of the WW remark and the cave drawings of the night king with a beard may have give us an insight into how things are not what they seem. Maybe.

He would have built the wall, storms end, and make the pact with the children of the forest.  when he got too old, he could just warg into another version of himself and just keep the cycle going.

[SPOILERS] What's the general consensus regarding Cersei's fourth child?,"In the first season, Cersei talks to Catelyn Stark and, I believe, Robert Baratheon about her first born child, who had brown or black hair which would probably make it Robert's child, that died early on in his life. Since then, he has never been mentioned again or even referenced. Did they just give up on that part? Is there like a secret where Cersei was making that child up or something and he never existed? How does the witch play into all of that, when she said Cersei would have three children that would all die? Perhaps the witch was referring to how Cersei viewed her children, and maybe Cersei never saw that child as her own since it was Roberts or something?

I also want to make sure the fingers are proportional to one another and are in a very similar shape to the original Game of Thrones Hand of the King Pin. Also the sword will need to be tucked in behind the pointer and middle fingers.

[SPOILERS] A theory on the possible child of Ashara Dayne,"Now before I begin I just want to stat I do not think the show will have time to deal with the entire Ashara Dayne stuff so this will be a book only discussion (though who knows maybe they do and it is the third book twist) Anyways let's get started. So anyways R+L=J has been confirmed in the show and I believe it will be in the books (minus Jon's name being Aegon, I think it will be something else like Jaehearys or Aemon or hell maybe even Aerys) yes while I don't think R+L is the third book twist (In the sense that it was NOT something we would see coming) but I do think it will be the confirmed parentage in the books.

I don't think Ned and Ashara had a thing. Yes maybe Ned did have some feelings for Ashara but I don't think he ever acted on them nor do I think it led to the two having a child I think the whole rumors about Ned and Ashara being a thing is a red herring and I think it is made clear Jon is not Ned's child in the text. But that being said is it still possible Ashara fell in love with a Stark and had a child. Yes while I am not 100% certain I think it is possible Ashara may have had a child still but NOT with Ned, But instead perhaps with Brandon Stark Ned's older brother whom I believe is the one who slept with Ashara if this is the case (though another possibility I had that maybe Barristan Selmy is the true lover of Ashara Dayne but that theory is for another day).

However if it did lead to a child who do I think the child is? well I don't think it is Jon and also do not believe the child is Dany. So who could it be Edric? Gerold? Meera? Daario? Aegon/Young Griff? I believe if there was a child (and yes that is an IF) I believe it is a completely new character we have not met yet who could be introduced in the next book. Perhaps maybe he will turn up after the book version of the Battle of the Bastards with Howland Reed and reveal who he is, Maybe want to take one of his cousins hand in marriage (Arya or Sansa) or maybe take Alys Karstark's hand in marriage. However I don't think the show will do something like this since they will not have time to do this though it is possible...I say that very loosely by the way because we are reaching the final season (though who knows maybe it is the third book twist, not saying it is I am saying who knows).

Anyways do I think something like that will happen, I am not 100% on Ashara having a child with Brandon but I think it is possible.",gameofthrones,True,1529007690,2018-06-14

If you're checking this subreddit in the deep heart of the off-season, there's a fair chance you're quite a dedicated Thrones fan. And so, probably pretty knowledgeable.

We run a Trivia competition every second Saturday on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/gameofthrones) – anywhere between 50-100 quickfire questions, from lore to completing quotes. [Here's an example of the chat](https://i.imgur.com/ZXZbVEx.png) (the bot deletes all replies after the correct answer is given).

Aaaand you can win prizes. Not every Trivia has prizes, but many do, including the next – the winner can pick a prize, and one random person who takes part too. [Here's a link to an image showing the selection.](https://i.imgur.com/ZXZbVEx.png)

[SPOILERS] My final Late S8 Predictions,"So today is the conclusion to my character arc predictions in the form of my full predictions…Well I shouldn’t say that as I pretty much kindof gave most of my predictions in the form of the other post on some of the character arc predictions I did, I’d recommend reading those first.
Arya:  https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

Sansa &amp; Bran: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8nbg4u/spoilers_my_predictions_for_bran_sansa_in_season_8/

Jon &amp; Daenerys: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8o1pr5/spoilers_predictions_for_daenerys_targaryen_and/

House Lannister: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8q8pb1/spoilers_my_predictions_for_house_lannister_in/

But I short Arya and Gendry hook up, Bran and Sam go to God’s Eye, WF plotline from last season is retconed, Cersei sends Euron to surprise attack WF, and Jon rides Rhaegal. Okay now I will get into my actual predictions. Okay so I will be combining some of my ideas with most of the news I heard so far (and maybe just one Leak).

-	NK attacks WF not before attacking Bear Island, Last Hearth, and Karhold. Also Euron and the GC surprise attacks/sacks WF.
-	Also before hand Edd and his men were killed attacking AOTD after Eastwatch (I think he and the NW will die one way or another)
-	Mel uses her magic to fight off the undead and the NK.
-	Cersei has Miscarriage
-	Gendry forges Dragonglass and Valyrian steel (thanks to Sam telling him how)
-	Lives are lost in the first battle (Tormund, Ghost, Yohn Royce, Grey Worm, Bronn, Beric, and most of the Northern Lords), Beric gives Gendry kiss of life.
-	Yara gets forsaken treatment; Theon is forced to put Yara out of her misery after he finds her in her own Reek Persona.
-	Sansa, Varys, and Tyrion are kidnapped by Euron and taken to Cersei, conflict on both sides with Tyrion’s tongue getting cut out.
-	Jaime, The Hound, Brienne, and Pod are send on a mission to deal with Cersei, they run into Arya and Gendry who are on the same mission.
-	Arya gets the chance to kill Cersei but chooses family over vengeance letting Jaime get the kill.
-	Dany gives births to twins, Survives childbirth.
-	CLEGANEBOWL, the hound wins but dies not long after too bloodlose.
-	Dany and Drogon die fighting the NK and Viserion.
-	Bran at the God’s Eye reveals to Jon the reason the WW’s returned and that Rhaegar was AA/TPTWP and Jon is Lightbringer.
-	Jaime and Brienne set off the wildfire under the Red Keep, Sacrificing themselves to kill the Wights that have entered the city. In Blackwater Bay Theon fights Euron and dies killing him, avenging his sister.
-	Jon and NK have one on one fight in the God’s Eye, Which ends with Jon and Sam holding him down and removing the Dragonglass from his chest killing him.
-	All Wights (including Viserion) collapse and WW’s turn back to human form.
-	All three Dragons die.
-	Jon is chosen by the people to be the new king of the Seven Kingdoms, However he decides to break the wheel and melt down the Iron Throne starting a Proto-Democratic Government/Proto-Republic ending the Game of Thrones.
-	It is also decided there will no longer be one person ruling the seven kingdoms, and that there will be a ruler for each Kingdom ruling together.
-	Tyrion is made Lord of Casterly Rock, Sansa made Queen of the North, Robin is made Lord of the Vale though a new house is using him as a puppet leader under Sansa’s orders, New house rules Pyke, Edmure rules the Riverlands, A new Sand Snake rules Dorne, Sam rules Highgarden, and Bran leaves far North with the now turned human WW’s
-	Either Arya sails more West with Gendry by her side or she marries Gendry and they become Lord and Lady of Stormlands.
-	Jon rules the Crownlands and raises his children and Ned raised him long ago.",gameofthrones,True,1529070062,2018-06-15
[SPOILERS] Rickon Stark thoughts,"Just finished Game of Thrones and am wondering why Rickon is so poorly written for or even why he’s a character. All the other Stark’s have big roles in the series but his was so underwhelming. He just followed Bran until he left for castle black, Tarly somehow made it there before him.

After spending two seasons wondering where he went, he came back but only in two scenes where he didn’t speak and was killed. I’m wondering if this is different in the books or just why they did this

[SPOILERS] What will the final shot of the series be?,"So what will the final shot of the epic series be? I know that is a weird question but what will it be, Sam reading to Little Sam and Jon and Dany’s child the story we just watch, A scene regarding the future of Westeros the children (NOT the children of the Forest but the children of the older generations)? Will it see all characters dead? Hopefully NOT that last one but what do you guys think? Personally I think it will be Sam reading the story to Little Sam and the child of Jon and Dany but I think it will be more then that. I think it will also focus on the future and changing the mistakes of the past (after the NK is defeated of course and I may make a separate post on how they are defeated), Basically in the words of a certain person who may or may not be from a separate franchise entirely “Let the Past die. Kill it if you have too” of course in the sense they would be fixing the mistakes of the older generations.

For example maybe if a child Is Illegitimate he will not longer be labelled a bastard and be treated with the same respect, care, and love as the legitimate children from now on, most of the marriages will be out of love and not arranged ones, and there will no longer be one person ruling a kingdom but each of the Seven Kingdoms is ruled by there own ruler, Oh and also a Proto-Democratic Government is established for each one maybe. Also I think it be cool (Only if both Jon AND Dany will die, which I don’t think will happen I think Jon will live but Dany will die) if Jon and Dany die. Perhaps there child is raised by either Sam and Gilly (Jon’s best friend), Jaime and Brienne (the man sworn to protect Rhaegar raises Jon and Dany’s child), or Arya and Gendry (not only Jon’s favourite sibling/cousin but also it would be a Stark and a Baratheon raising a Targaryen, let that sink into your head.), Though I believe that Dany will die but Jon will live to raise his child or children.",gameofthrones,True,1529245696,2018-06-17

[SPOILERS] Loras Tyrell's inquest,"At the inquest, where Loras is accused by the High Sparrow of being a homosexual, the Sparrows call Olyvar to testify. The damning piece of evidence against Loras, is the reveal of a unique birthmark on his upper thigh.

Could Loras have not stated, that as his squire, Olyvar would have seen him naked or even near naked at some point.

Instead he lunges at Olyvar, damning himself. I know it was a highly emotional and intense moment, but the Tyrells are very witty in politics and persuasion. I feel they could have dealt with the inquest much better.

I have only seen the TV series, so maybe there is more information in the books, it just grinds on me slightly, how the Tyrells missed this opportunity to maybe save their only future of their house.

What are your thoughts?

"[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones Season 7, Episode 1: Major Plot Hole at Dragonstone?","\[Spoilers Ahead\] 

So when Dany reaches Dragonstone at the end of the episode and finally walks into her fortress, why are there still so many remnants of Targaryens - the two large dragon heads by the entrance, dragons as door handles, the Targaryen sigil on the floor of the throne room and the full dragons on the walls of the war room? Why did Stannis not erase all signs of their hated Targaryens from the halls he was granted by Robert when they won the war, since he would be holding it for life as the crown would always go to Robert's children? We see that Dany does pull down one of Stannis' 'flaming heart with a stag' banners, meaning the castle was still untouched since Stannis departed and also shows that Stannis did indeed put up banners of his house. Yet there are no signs of the lord of light or even plain Baratheons before the Red Priestess came to Stannis. Why would Stannis want to have the sigil of his enemy's house (and a presumed-dead-at-that-time dynasty) branded across the floor of his throne room/great hall?",gameofthrones,True,1529282230,2018-06-17

10) [Joffreys armour at Blackwater Bay](https://i.imgur.com/EC9ZcsL.jpg) a beautifully engraved set, with lions etched everywhere, it’s the best House Lannister has ever looked

9) [The Dornish soldiers](https://i.imgur.com/HBflr0b.jpg), a very different style of armour, suited to the Dornish climate and style of warfare, gives me very Moorish/Spanish/Middle Eastern vibes

8) [The goldcloaks](https://i.imgur.com/oCbf04j.jpg), very Ottoman inspired armour, fitting as Kings Landing is supposedly based on Constantinople and also very similar to other Baratheon armour

7) [Stannis and House Baratheon of Dragonstone](https://i.imgur.com/CREN9gZ.png), heavily armoured in plated mail, they look imposing and professional

6) [House Stark soldiers](https://i.imgur.com/UC47koa.png) I’m a sucker for mail, and the Starks have a lot! A very weathered and northern look about these men, I like it

5) [House Tyrell’s heavy infantry ](https://i.imgur.com/KeZzeZc.jpg), professional, flashy and fabulous, these soldiers look like they’d get the job done in style

4) [The Hound](https://i.imgur.com/bIUYDwK.jpg), brutish and heavy, it fits the Hound perfectly, and he looks intimidating as hell wearing it

3) [Briennes first suit of armour](https://i.imgur.com/IH7Z93W.jpg), fluted and styled in a very unique way, this captures Brienne and the Stormlands martial nature in a very practical looking set including both plate and mail

2) [Ser Loras Tyrell ](https://i.imgur.com/lGWiwH0.jpg), the perfect knight in shining armour, he looks straight out of a fairytale. However, it still looks practical and is very close to historical plate armour 

1) [Ser Jorah Mormont’s first suit](https://i.imgur.com/lR9QLgD.jpg), greyed plate from years of battle over fine mail, with northern style pauldrons and a unique look that seems like the North’s answer to knights, this armour has been my favourite since I saw.

[No Spoilers] I met Dean-Charles Chapman!,"https://i.redd.it/unmhh94cvl111.jpg

So, I recently attended an event called Throne\-fest. For what it was, it was okay, it received some negative reviews which is understandable. However, this truly made my day. Lets set the scene...

My sister wanted to sit on the Iron throne, so I agreed. At the time we went, the queue was huge. After about an hour, I was questioning leaving it, but I am glad I didn't! At around the hour and a half mark, we were close. In eye sight the excitement was kicking in. They had a huge dragon going past and it was such a good environment. Despite the huge queue everyone was chatty. Anyway, we were around 10 people behind to the Throne, and Dean walked past the queue. I immediately recognised him because of his hair. No one else did though, and not until his agent said that it was Tommen that people started getting excited \(which kinda annoyed me, but this isn't a rant\). The longest 7 minutes began of my life, trying to move closer to see him. I saw he engaged in a conversation with a woman, which showed how genuine he was. They then agreed something \(I couldn't hear\) and I could clearly see he was about to leave. I was genuinely so lucky and grateful I was in his path as he went to leave as it allowed me to get a photo. He is such a genuine guy and this truly made my day, I was so lucky as he didn't stay long. I am so grateful for a cast that cares. The Throne was quite far from where his tent \(for signing\) was, so he didn't have to do that. This was my second experience with a celeb, and he made it a truly memorable one.

My first experience was earlier that day with Tom Wlaschiha where he signed my Pop! Vinyl, where he was also very kind. He said 'Have you sat on the Iron Throne? They say it is a bad omen, everyone who sits on it dies' which made me laugh, but I am glad I didn't listen to him as i met Dean :D

[NO SPOILERS] Does anyone really want a Game of Thrones RTS Game?,"As much as season 7 has slightly tainted the pacing and quality that I expect from the TV show, I do still love game of thrones. And I think it would make a freaking epic Real Time Strategy PC game (similar to Lord of The Rings: Battle For Middle Earth) Like conquering all of westoros as a particular faction, Creating alliances, or just straight up taking on everyone (who then may ally up with others to fight you) and then obviously have the Night King being an enemy faction to everyone. 

I'd love it. And with certain houses colliding it may spawn alliances that wouldn't normally happen.

Or maybe even have an option to create your own faction to take on the actual factions and houses (like stark and Lannister) would that be cool? Or just me?",gameofthrones,True,1527956480,2018-06-02
[SPOILERS] Predictions for Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow,"Hello this is the third part of my season 8 predictions for characters arcs. Today I will be doing the two last Targaryens in the world (as far as I know) Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen. Now I have already done two already, One for Arya which I will link right here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

And one for both Bran and Sansa Stark which I shall also link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8nbg4u/spoilers_my_predictions_for_bran_sansa_in_season_8/

Okay so last season saw Jon and Dany hook up on there way to the North on a boat and I believe this season will be about them coming to terms with the situation of Jon being a Targ. But however who will the North react well they will probably send Gendry first to let everyone know of there arrival. When Jon arrives to WF Jon and Dany will get looks from the Northern Lords and some of the Northern Small Folk (and not nice looks either) But Jon will get reunions with Sam, Ghost, Sansa, Bran, and a very heartfelt reunion from Arya. I also believe we will get some bounding scenes between Jon and Dany and we may get the revelation of Dany being pregnant when she sees a Maester about it. Anyways Jon will hold a meeting in the Great Hall to prepare for the battle, Though they will have made a plan the Northerners including Sansa and even Arya will give Jon smack for bending the knee.

Jon will also confront Arya about the Bag of Faces and what she and Sansa did last season, She will explain everything she had to go through and also that she was simply testing Sansa/Pushing her into not trusting LF. Anyways Jon will be told the truth by Bran, Sam, and Howland Reed (if Howland even shows up, which I sadly doubt he will at this point), Jon will have a lot of mixed emotions and not only tell the Stark sisters but also Dany and before Dany can even tell him she's pregnant the horn's go off signalling the WW's have come. Dany will take to her Dragon Drogon and fly off into battle while Jon will lead the armies on the ground. The battle is brutal and Jon will lose a lot of men (including Tormund, Yohn Royce, and most of the Northern lords). He and Ghost will go in on the NK but NK will tear off Ghost head. Jon angered by this will charge at him but get surrounded by three WW's only to be saved by Jaime and Brienne.

Everyone will evacuate to the Riverlands and Jon will get revealed by Dany that she is pregnant, Jon will ultimately decide that they stay together for the child, not caring weather or not there Aunt and Nephew. Jon will also ride to the God's Eye to find out how to defeat the NK once and for all while Dany evacuates everyone to the Trident. Jon will be revealed by Bran once he is at the God's Eye that not only is his father Rhaegar AA/TPTWP and he is Lightbringer but also WW's have return due to a combination of...well if you read my predictions for Sansa and Bran I explain why. Anyways Jon is also told he must embrace his Targaryen side, Jon decides he is both a Stark and a Targaryen and ask Bran to warg into Rhaegal.

Meanwhile Dany goes into Labour alittle too Early but survives childbirth, giving birth to twins a boy and a girl (Rhaegar the II and Arya the I Targaryen). But she and her Drogon sense that the NK is near, she gets on Drogon and her and the NK and Viserion fight in the skies above the Trident with Dany leading him away to KL, Jon on Rhaegal joins in the fight as well. Viserion breaks Drogon's neck and Dany with Drogon fall from the skies, Dany is killed from the impact of the fall. Jon furious goes in on the NK and Rhaegal dies killing Viserion, the two land near the God's Eye. The two 1v1 with Bran trying to mess with NK's head by warging into him. Ultimately Jon gets the best of the NK and with help from Sam they pull out the Dragonglass from his chest, instantly killing him.

All the Wights Collapse and the WW's are turned back to human form. Jon learns of Dany's death Jon is chosen by the people to be king of the Seven Kingdoms and his first act is to melt down the Iron Throne and declare that there will no longer be one ruler ruling the whole seven kingdoms but a ruler for each kingdom, with them all working together. Jon will be forced to raise his children on his own with the Bittersweet ending being they one but Jon lost another lover and a lot of friends in the process.",gameofthrones,True,1527956986,2018-06-02

[SPOILERS] Chaos is a ladder,"&gt; “Always  keep your foes confused. If they are never certain who you are or what  you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next. Sometimes the  best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose, or even  seem to work against you. Remember that, Sansa, when you come to play  the game.” 

I don't really think Littlefinger  just died that easy. this man was prepared for everything and mastered plot to get rid of a king and his hand. He had the balls to say to the hand

&gt; ""Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse."" 

He said this to Ned in his face so he knew that everyone shouldn't trust him, and what about being in the middle of winterfell among Sansa, Arya, Bran and knights of the Vale!

He knew the damage he did to Sansa, he heard what Bran said ""chaos is a ladder"" and this means Bran can see and hear everything including all his plots and lies. 

there was a woman talking to him and he gave her a coin, not sure its iron or silver, but it may be iron for it's just one coin and no one will pay in silver or gold in one piece, and if it's iron the woman must be from the faceless men, who can be hired to kill someone or to die for others.

I think he sensed the sensed the danger rising around him and knew that it's coming one way or other so he increased the tension between Sansa and Arya and gave them an image of himself to be slaughtered while he ran away. 

Here is one weak point that is Bran is here who sees everything, but maybe if that is true Bran would leave him as now Littlefinger isn't his biggest problem.

[SPOILERS] Thoughts on Bran's end game role and religion?,"In my opinion the most ambiguous storyline left in the show is Bran's. Every other character in the show is well developed and their abilities/characteristics that will affect the end game are established (Jon's leadership, Tyrion's intellect, Daenerys' dragons and their ""magic""). Yet, while we do know some of what Bran can do, we do not fully understand his power and therefore people seem to be struggle to see where he fits in the end game. We know he can see the past, present, and future (when he said the sea would flood Winterfell, and then Theon captured it). We know he has the ability to alter events in the past, even though the TER said the ink is dry, how else can you explain Hodor or young Ned turning around at the Tower of Joy? To me it is clear he is more powerful than the TER, but to what extent I'm unsure. I know there are a lot of theories about where Bran will come into play, but he has the widest range of theories due to the ambiguity of his powers and that which gives him these powers. I have read that some people believe Bran's abilities will somehow tie into the religious aspect of the story. Since religion plays such a vitally important role in advancing the story's plots, I truly believe that there will at least be some tying out of the religious powers on Westeros. Given that Bran can influence the past and see the future, it is clear he is vastly more powerful than any other character, we have already seen that he has the power of, I dare to say, a ""god"". I know if there is some kind of tie out for religion it will probably draw heavily from the ""it's just magic"" card, but I really hope it doesn't end with Bran just having special abilities everytime he touches a certain type of tree, I hope we get some more clarity than that. I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on exactly how they could see this clarity being given through Bran's role in the endgame and if  this will involve tying out some of the unexplained religious events we have seen.",gameofthrones,True,1527972196,2018-06-02

[SPOILERS] A theory/prediction for House Greyjoy,"So I have had this theory for alittle while now and that is with House Martell and House Tyrelll siding with Dany and there houses going pretty much extinct (though Martells may be in question considering The Red Viper has more Bastards daughters) I think it is possible that House Greyjoy could go fully extinct next season. 

Now my evidence for this is first up, look at the order of when the houses side With dany and then when they are wiped out, Greyjoys are the first to side with Dany. Then Houses Tyrell and Martell. The order of who's getting wiped out goes backwards from this. House Martell and Tyrell have already gone extinct now it is only a matter of time until Greyjoy get there turn.

Also we know that Theon can't produce children, Euron will most likely die, Damphair has no real propose in the story, and Yara children would not be named Greyjoy. It has been foreshadowed for either Yara or Theon to die so maybe both die. Now how do I think they will die? Well...

Euron will be killed by Theon, Damphair will die at Eurons hands, Theon will be forced to put Yara out of her misery as she is now in her own Reek Persona, and Theon will die either saving Yara or protecting Bran and maybe Arya.",gameofthrones,True,1527979130,2018-06-02

10 parallels between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen and similar or shared dialogue and images.,"1\) Both Jon and Daenerys lost their parents during Robert's Rebellion. Both of their fathers died before their birth, and both of their mothers dies during childbirth.  

2\) Both were then smuggled away from their birthplace for the same reason, it wasn’t safe for them. Daenerys to Essos, Jon to Winterfell. 

3\) While there they both lived as outcast. Dany because she was in exile, and Jon because he was a supposed bastard. Furthermore, they were both treated bad during their childhood, Dany by Viserys, and Jon by Catelyn.  

4\) They both lived in the shadow of their brother. Jon was always in the shadow of trueborn Rob Stark, heir to Winterfell and the North, and Jon also claimed he was Jealous of Rob his whole life. Daenerys was in the shadow of Viserys, who was the one true king of Westeros \(according to himself\) 

5\) Both Jon and Daenerys' life are forever changed because of a feast. For Daenerys, it is her wedding feast and for Jon it is the feast at Winterfell where he decides to join the Night's Watch. 

6\) They both struggle in their new life. Daenerys finds it hard to adapt to the savage Dothraki's way of life, and Jon has a hard time to become accepted by his new brothers of the Night's Watch.  

7\) Their first love parallels each other as well. Daenerys and Drogo – Jon and Ygritte. At first both Jon and Daenerys didn’t really like their love, but after a while they started to generally love them. In the end they both died in their arms, and in both cases Daenerys and Jon were somewhat responsible for that.  

8\) They both dedicated their lives to save and help those who were refused. Daenerys was interested in helping free the slaves and keep them alive. Jon did all he could to help the Wildlings and save them for the Army of The Dead. Also, both are now fighting with Jon and Daenerys. The wildlings are fighting with Jon – for example in the Battle of the Bastards and the unsullied, who were the former slaves are fighting with Daenerys not by force but because they want to. 

9\) Both Jon and Daenerys are the ones to bring back the magical animal sigils of their house, Jon was the one to convince Ned to keep the direwolf pups, and Daenerys literally brought back dragons. 

10\) Both Jon and Daenerys were given the chance to get what they always wanted, but both refused to do what they believed was right and because of their morals. Jon was offered by Stannis to be legitimised, and Daenerys was offered ships and money to sail to Westeros for the throne. 

I'm sure there's many many more!

Question on white walkers (spoilers),"Maybe I missed it, but have we ever seen a white walker be struck by a weapon that was not dragonglass or Valyrian steel? ",gameofthrones,True,1527987988,2018-06-02
[Spoilers] Game of Thrones Ending Predictions," Game of Thrones Ending Prediction
Did John Snow’s sword “Longclaw” actually blink?

How does Benjen conveniently show up to save both Bran and John?

How are all of these connected?
 
 To start things off I would like to set a base of general assumptions that can be made based of what the story has offered so far up until season eight.
 
Bran has the ability to time travel and is somehow connected to the Knightking because the Knighting was able to see him when Bran was traveling through time.
The children made white walkers during the war against the first men to combat the first men and their destructive tendencies.
The white walkers were men that were created as a weapon for children of the forest.
After the scene where bran travels back in time to the first white walker being made, later that episode it alludes to the fact that the white walkers had fulfilled the task that would bring them out of existence (destroying the first men). This is accomplished in the scene where bran is next to the Weirwood where the scene takes place in winter and the army of the dead is at the tree. It is assumed the war against the first men is over because it’s winter and the first men had been destroyed so why would the white walkers return to the tree of their creators ,the children of the forest, other than to have their curse removed. The night king and his followers are searching for an end to their existence yet are at a standstill at this point in time. Their purpose is exhausted at this point in time and this is where they wait for Bran. They have no goal until they make contact with Bran which gives a sense of where he is in the physical and temporal. This shows there is some similarity in the magic that the Kinghtking and Bran utilize.
 
Bran, the knightking, Benjen, and John Snows sword are all aligned with each other in some sense to make a profound ending to relieve the whites from their curse.
 
Benjen was turned into a walker and was turned back into a man through the children of the forest. Benjen is not acting out of self-interests which raises concern about the magic or superior force that is communicating with him to save two pivotal characters in the story not only once but twice. The first being when he saves bran from the white walkers and the second when he saves john snow from the walkers. If he is somehow correlated with the same magic the white walkers embody that means that the controlling force of that magic wants both of those characters alive for a particular reason. In the scene where John is fighting a white and surprisingly deflects the strike of a walker the walker is significantly surprised that the sword prevented his strike. I believe this is to assert the power and role the sword has to play in some sort of prophecy. Could it be that Bran and John snow or his sword have a role to play to end the suffering of the knightking in some ultimate sacrifice or prophecy?
 
This is all in addition to the fact that The Lord of Light (the only religion in this show to be proven “true”) also wants John Snow alive. They say they don’t know why this is, but it must be for the same reason the force controlling Benjen saves John Snow. His prophecy must end up being to save mankind, which would entail stopping the curse of the White Walkers which would free both the Knight King as well as mankind. All in all, whatever the prophecy is to end the suffering of the Knight King, it requires John Snow and Bran to be alive, for now…
Basically the whole series is about the Knight King wanting to relieve his curse. For the past however many years, the Knight King has repeatedly traveled South every winter to attempt to relieve his curse. For some reason, the time frame we are watching contains characters that will make his journey South different this time. There has to be something we don’t know about that is the key to breaking the curse of the Children.
 
What are some of your opinions or references that might contribute to why the Knight King would need both John and Bran alive? Where does Khaleesi come into all of this? What role exactly does Benjen play? What would end the curse?
 
I may be completely off on these assumptions, but if I am then Game of Thrones has huge plot holes to it, major ones being that a character (Benjen) we see only in the first episode comes back randomly to save the two most important characters of the show from Whites. Coincidence? I think not…

"[SPOILERS] a Theory of Arya, Gendry, and Young Griff","Now before I begin I am aware Young Griff is not in the show so for the most part while I may bring up the show in some areas, this is a book only theory, now that I got that out of the way I shall begin. Arya/Gendry besides Jon/Dany and Jaime/Brienne is my Favorite shipping in Game of Thrones mainly because it has been setup a lot (especially in the show), unlike most shippings it would make sense from a storytelling perspective, and overall they seem to trust each other. But however for the books I think we could see a love triangle between Arya Stark, Gendry Waters/Baratheon, and Young Griff/Aegon the VI Targaryen (Blackfyre). 

I believe in the show next season we will see a possible romance between Arya and Gendry, and in the books we could see a love triangle between Arya, Gendry, and Aegon. Now what is my evidence for this, well...i'll start with Gendry:

- Arya and Gendry have been friends and with each other for awhile now and in the show Arya says the line ""I can be your family"" in which Gendry replies ""you would not be my family. You would be my lady"". The actress who plays Arya was told to say it if she was telling him ""I love you"".

- Arya and Gendry seems to trust each other

- Robert told Ned that he had a son and Ned had a daughter they would join houses. yes that was meant for Joffrey and Sansa though it could also be seen as forshadowing for Arya and Gendry.

- There marriage would bring full circle the idea of a Baratheon marrying a Stark.

There are many other reasons I could get into right now but I will stop here, Now let's get to Aegon:

- Both Aegon and Arya know what it's like to be afraid, be hunted, and be the hunter.

- Both have also have been shaped to rule since they could walk (though with Arya is harder to see but if you look deeper into it, it makes alittle more sense).

- A Marriage between Aegon and Arya would be full circle with Rhaegar and Lyanna (yes I knows Aegon is most likely a Blackfyre but nobody knows he is one though)

- Also it would grant Young Griff control of the North, If Arya reunites with her family.

- In the Maggy the Frog prophecy it is said a more beautiful queen will cast Cersei down, and I believe Arya is that more beautiful queen (though I don't think Young Griff is the Valonqar, he could be Jaime's Valonqar but not Cersei's. Jaime would be Cersei's Valonqar). Yes I do think Arya will grow up to be as beautiful as Lyanna.

- It is stated Dany has one last betrayal, the one for love. Perhaps if Aegon falls in love with Arya that will be the betrayal for love. 

- Now how would they meet idk.

Now in conclusion I think it is definitely possible we could see a romantic love triangle between the three. Do I think it will happen? No I think Arya will end up with Gendry (especially in the show) and Young Griff will end up with Sansa. But I think the love triangle idea is possible.",gameofthrones,True,1528022797,2018-06-03

[Spoilers] The Valonqar,"I have reason to believe that Jamie had already killed Cersei right before he left King's Landing, Why? Well Jamie last saw Cersei at the neck of Westeros and himself at the Fingers \(see the picture below\). the Valonqar prophecy states ""And when your tears have drowned you, the **Valonqar** \(Jamie\) shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat an**d choke the life from yo**u"", as we leave King's Landing we see Jamie in all black covering his golden hand \(the one in this theory would have killed Cersei, and would dissolve his Lannister name\). and why would Jamie do all of this? well, throughout his story Jamie has been on a path to change his former self by doing good and \(not by his own hand\) loosing his tool that killed the King and raped his sister. So killing Cersei would disprove the myths that Jamie had insest with his Sister or that he killed the King just for himself and most importantly that he is not a Lannister the family that started this whole mess.

Next, I just don't like the hate for Cersei from the fandom. This isn't exactly the problem with the show, but I think they could have made her more easy to sympathise with. I think she's the most interesting and well-performed character on the show, and the fandom should see from her precarious position.

Ned Stark, Robb etc. You weren’t expecting them to die at that moment, by they did. And the four characters I’m talking about ALREADY had they WTF-death-scenes, some of them more then once. Jon was literally dead and came back, the Hound should have died after the fight with Brienne, but survived, Tyrion should have died at the Blackwater and after his trial by combat (because of Oberyn’s WTF death) and Tormund should have died at the wight hunt and as the Wall came down (but we already know he survived).

[SPOILERS] Can we talk about Sandor and the mountain in the dragon pit season 8?,"So I just read the theory by /u/440k that Sandor says to the hound that he knows what is coming for him because he saw his death in the flames as a child. 

My guess on this is that there is a lot that could actually lead to this theory not only being true but also extend it a little. So hear me out, put your tinfoil on and let's go.

So it all starts with Sandor seeing the death of the mountai in the flames as a child. In response to this Gregor Turns completely nuts and pushes Sandor in the flames. But at this point how would Sandor know that he can trust the vision? He could think that it was nothing and just troll his brother little.

I think he doesn't understand until he sees the vision in season 8 and it is confirmed for him that he can trust them as suicide squad reaches the spikey Hill and the army of the dad is actually there. In this moment it snaps for him and he is absolutely sure that the flames showed him the actual death of Gregor and that he can trust the visions. 

Now in season 8 there are two scenes that make me suspicious about how Gregor actually dies. Here comes the tinfoil part. Sandor did not only see Greg die but he saw Arya kill him. We know that Brienne is a tough girl and able to defeat the hound. And in season 8 we learned that Arya is insane with her assassin's abilities so that she was able to beat Brienne in a sparring. For me this is serious foreshadowing that the mountain could be defeated by Arya. 

Moreover he actually is on her list and the hound knows this I mean... There has to be some connection. 

The second big red flag for me was when the hound and Brienne met in s8. They talk about Arya and he learns that she has become very good with the sword, he does not seem suprised by that. This just proofs even more the vision he saw as a child and that they were real. 

In the end the questions remaining are why the Lord of light wanted Sandor to see this and why Arya has to kill the mountain. Another question is if the hound purposefully wanted to keep Arya alive because to some extend he believed in the vision.

"[Spoilers] Rewatch - Questions, Comments and musings from a summer rewatch (to fill the void)","So re watching game.of thrones this summer from the beginning.. just started.. trying to fill the void and pretend therr is a season.. but honestly this search has been exciting
 focusing on listening for history and foreshadowing... havr some quick questions, then some.random musings..


In regards to.the Tower of Joy, Jon Snow &amp; Ned stark 
* what do the common folk think happened to Lyanna? She just died?
* everyone in the realm knows who need stark.is and thst he's honorable, even ones thst don't follow politics.. who do the common folk think is the mother of lord eddards bastard son?
* during RR, why didn't elia and her two children flee to dragonstone with the young (I'm sure bratty) Viserys, and mad kings preggo wife (with daenyrs)?


What's truly amazing is how much information they give out in season 1. And it's very well told IMO.. It's subtle and worked into dialog... besides bran asking for scary stories from old nan, you learn a ton of.history in season 1. 
* I often wonder though if people who are watching for the first time, and don't know the names rhagar, Lyanna, battle of trident and the burning of.neds older.brother and dad (this.is.one of.the few.history items that is repeated, most are.one off convos) --- *would they pick up on the history*??

* they say Tywin was fierce and cunning before we even met him. Also said he was hand of the king for 20 years. They also mention he sacked the city 
* almost seems like people know about Jon 
* Jamie was being a prick to the dude  (jory?, meds right hand man in KL) he ended up stabbing in the eye.. they share war stories and talk.about Thoros of Myr breaking the pike siege by running right through it (and in the most recent season he had his flaming sword..and admitted he was drunk. Well no shit)
* They tell lots of stories like little finger talking about dueling Brandon and learning he couldn't play their game, or varys telling us how he lost his man hood and traveled with thespian (can't remember Essex/bravo word for actor/performer), learning Theo's story.. they mentioned ward Like one maybe twice.. then in a later episode, tyrion gave us more info before bending rod over. His father balon mention onky once 

There are more.subtle.ones but they escape me currently
* 

Also tons of foreshadowing and hints,
* girl in tub with Viserys talka.about faceless men
* multiple Jon Snow is special moments thst didn't notice the first two times

[Spoilers] 10 parallels between Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen and similar or shared dialogue and images.,"* Both Jon and Daenerys lost their parents during Robert's Rebellion. Both of their fathers died before their birth, and both of their mothers dies during childbirth.   
* Both were then smuggled away from their birthplace for the same reason, it wasn’t safe for them. Daenerys to Essos, Jon to Winterfell.  
* While there, they both lived as outcast. Daenerys because she was in exile, and Jon because he was a supposed bastard. Furthermore, they were both treated bad during their childhood, Daenerys by Viserys, and Jon by Catelyn.   
* They both lived in the shadow of their brother. Jon was always in the shadow of trueborn Rob Stark, heir to Winterfell and the North, and Jon also claimed he was Jealous of Rob his whole life. Daenerys was in the shadow of Viserys, who was the one true king of Westeros \(according to himself\)  
* Both Jon and Daenerys' life are forever changed because of a feast. For Daenerys, it is her wedding feast and for Jon it is the feast at Winterfell where he decides to join the Night's Watch.  
* They both struggle in their new life. Daenerys finds it hard to adapt to the savage Dothraki's way of life, and Jon has a hard time to become accepted by his new brothers of the Night's Watch.   
* Their first love parallels each other as well. Daenerys and Drogo – Jon and Ygritte. At first both Jon and Daenerys didn’t really like their love, but after a while they started to generally love them. In the end they both died in their arms, and in both cases Daenerys and Jon were somewhat responsible for that.   
* They both dedicated their lives to save and help those who were refused. Daenerys was interested in helping free the slaves and keep them alive. Jon did all he could to help the Wildlings and save them from the Army of The Dead. Also, both are now fighting with Jon and Daenerys. The wildlings are fighting with Jon – for example in the Battle of the Bastards. The unsullied, who were the former slaves are fighting with Daenerys not by force but because they want to.  
* Both Jon and Daenerys are the ones to bring back the magical animal sigils of their house, Jon was the one to convince Ned to keep the direwolf pups, and Daenerys literally brought back dragons.  
* Both Jon and Daenerys were given the chance to get what they always wanted, but both refused to do what they believed was right and because of their morals. Jon was offered by Stannis to be legitimised, and Daenerys was offered ships and money to sail to Westeros for the throne.

[SPOILERS] Soundtrack,"I've been listening to the soundtrack a lot, and there's things I've noticed that are quite interesting. You might already know these, but I've only just started picking up on them.

Leitmotifs are used often, like the melancholy Stark theme playing when Ice is melted down, then taken over by The Rains of Castamere as Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail are forged. After Cersei blows up the Sept, her theme changes to incorporate the Light of the Seven alongside her Rains of Castamere.

Both Joffrey and Tommen have similar themes to King Robert's ""The King's Arrival"", with Joffrey having ominous strings in ""You'll be Queen one day"" and Tommen having a solemn choir taken over by an orchestra in ""First of his Name"".

One of my favourite examples is Dany's ""The Winds of Winter"" which starts out with the Greyjoy theme, replaced by all of Dany's themes, from the Dothraki ""Blood of My Blood"" to the Unsullied and dragon theme ""Dracarys"" and the main theme.

Two other amazing examples are the two parts of ""Spoils of War"" from S7. They have themes from the Rains of Castamere to Light of the Seven to the Dothraki warhorns, and ""What is Dead may never Die"" from Season 2, when Theon travels back home. It starts with the Stark theme, then drums join as it fades to the Greyjoy theme as Theon looks over to the Iron Islands.

I could go on forever about this, but what are some other recurring leitmotifs you noticed?",gameofthrones,True,1528160647,2018-06-04
Why do people hate sansa stark?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1528170309,2018-06-04
[Spoilers] Why do people hate sansa stark?,"This is a question for all you sansa haters. I've noticed that she has the most haters probably than any other character on the show, considering that she isn't a villain.

I've always loved sansa. She was a young girl that was spoiled and had vision of how her life was supposed to be. And she was very naive and unable to stand up for herself. Yes she's had a very slow learning curve but she has learned and she is growing stronger. She is very young and has been through a lot of loss, torture and humiliation and has not done anything to be cruel and yet people hate her. And Ned didn't die b/c of her, she thought Joffrey would spare him if he pledged his loyalty. She had no way of knowing that he would behead him! I mean hell, even Cersei, his own mother, was unable to predict that.
Sansa has been tortured, beaten and raped at such a young age. And has grown strong through it all, sure it took time, but IMO she's the most realistic character. She has no dragons, no men to fight for her, no boyfriend/husband that she truly loves and she literally was separated from her family until end of s6.
So why do u haters hate her? ",gameofthrones,True,1528171831,2018-06-05

{Spoilers} Arya’s 3 names do over....,"“She chose Chiswyck not because he was on her list, but because she heard him tell a horrifying story about gang-raping a thirteen-year-old girl and laughing about it. The man was a monster, and absolutely deserved to die. Arya could not kill all the monsters in the world (either directly or indirectly), but she could have that particular one killed, and so she did. I applaud her choice.
Her reasons for choosing Weese were more personal, as he was the man who she reported to as a slave-in-all-but-name at Harrenhal, and who abused her daily. She does feel ""buyer's remorse"" for this one, and decides that she should use the kill for some more important political figure, but Jaqen kills Weese before she can change her mind. But I wouldn't call even this kill a waste: there's nothing wrong with Arya wanting someone who beats her bloody everyday to die.
She names Jaqen himself as her third victim in order to get his cooperation for freeing Northern prisoners in Harrenhal, who then take over Harrenhal from the Lannisters. In one sense, this is the most valuable use of her three wishes - but in another, it's the only one that's really a waste in the long term, as the political coup would have happened even without her help: the Northern prisoners were working with Vargo Hoat (who had joined forces with Roose Bolton) to take over Harrenhal anyway, and all Arya's plot did was to speed up the process a bit. Arya doesn't even get anything positive out of it - she recognizes that Roose Bolton is not to be trusted, and wisely decides not to reveal herself to him.”  
https://www.quora.com/Did-Arya-Starks-three-deaths-serve-any-purpose-or-did-she-waste-them

Consensus belief is Arya wasted her 3 kills, and  for a long period of time  I thought the kills should be Geoffrey, Tywin, and Cersei.

However, if this happened then perhaps Daenyrs doesn’t form an alliance with Jon Snow and Westoros has to deal with the army of the dead AND Daenyrs.   So I ask you:

1. Who did you want initially killed?


2.  Would you pick the same people today?

Right now, I’m struggling to read A Clash of Kings by GRR Martin. I’m a big fan of fantasy and science fiction so given this series popularity I decided to pick it up. I’m having a difficult time with all the characters and plot threads and intrigue; who knows what and whom. 

I’m not sure what my difficulty is as I don’t THINK I’m a poor reader. Some of my favorite books are The Name of the Wind (Patrick Rothfuss) and Andrezj Sapkowski’s writings, which I think are subtle stories which require attention to detail to fully understand. 

Just wondering if anyone had any thoughts. I’m in my 20s and have been a bookworm all my life. I’ll also post this to the r/books subreddit as maybe my difficulty has more to do with GRR Martin’s writing style.

[Spoilers] Cersei and Daenerys parallels,"  So, recently I did 10 parallels of Jon Snow and Daenerys \- so here is Cersei and Daenerys.

* ***Both Cersei and Daenerys’ futures were revealed to them through magic*** \- Daenerys sees a slew of visions, which is likely foreshadowing future events. Most notably, Daenerys sees the throne room covered in snow. Cersei visits Maggy the Frog, who tells her that she will marry the king and become the queen. This came true when she married Robert Baratheon. The witch also says that she will have 3 children, all of whom will die, this also came true as well. During the show, Cersei has let her prophecy affect her mental state much more so than Daenerys has.
* ***Both Cersei and Daenerys were forced into arranged marriages to further the family name*** – in Cersie’s case, Tywin Lannister married her to Robert Baratheon after he claimed the Iron Throne. What’s interesting is that the only reason Cersei is in the position she is in now is because of her marriage to Robert. If she did not marry Robert and live through his death and the death of her children, she wouldn’t be sitting on the throne right now. Like Cersei, Daenerys endured an arranged marriage to further her families name. Viserys married Daenerys to Khal Drogo, as Viseryss plan was to command the Dothraki and take back the Iron Throne. 
* ***They are both products of in\-breeding, like a lot of characters –*** almost all Targaryens are were inbred. In Daenerys’ case, the Mad King \(Aerys II\) married his sister, Rhaella. Rhaella then has Rhaegar, Viserys and Daenerys. Cersei, on the other hand, is the product of cousins. Tywin Lannister married his cousin – Joanna Lannister
* ***Both Daenerys and Cersei use firepower when backed against a wall*** – Daenerys had 3 dragons \(now 2\), the first time we see Daenerys use firepower is in the House of the Undying. Pyat Pree had Daenerys in chains, until she ordered her dragons to set him aflame. From that point on, Daenerys has used her dragons quite a bit. Like Daenerys, Cersei also uses firepower when backed against a wall. Cersei saw no way out of her trail with the High Sparrow, this caused her with the help of Qyburn to blow up the Sept and major portion of King’s Landing. What’s interesting though is Daenerys’ firepower is often seen as a power move, which leave people to root for her. Cersei’s firepower is seen as evil. 
* ***Both has Gotten savage revenge on their enemies*** – Daenerys burned Mirri Maz Duur at the stake, who used blood magic to kill Daenerys’ unborn child and put Khal Drogo in a vegetative state. Cersei got revenge on Unella, the “Shame” nun, by pouring wine on her and, well who knows what the Mountain could have done to her. Cersei also got revenge on Ellaria Sand, who killed her daughter Myrcella with poison. The difference here, is Cersei takes much more pleasure taking revenge on her enimies.
* ***Both Daenerys and Cersei have asked Jon Snow to bend the knee*** – in season 7, they both sent letters to Jon Snow, which asked Jon Snow to bend the knee \(not that polite though\). Cersei asked Jon to “bend the knee to his rightful queen or suffer the fate of all traitors.” This is an obvious call back to Ned Stark, as Ned was beheaded once considered a traitor. The true difference between the letters is that Cersei was upfront with her desire for Jon Snow to bend the knee, while Daenerys got Jon Snow to come to Dragonstone before demanding this. It is worth noting though that Tyrion sent the letter on Daenerys’ behalf, which could explain why it wasn’t as demanding.

[Spoilers] ASOIAF ebooks annotated with the Westeros and Wikia wikis,"Hello, r/gameofthrones!

New to this subreddit and its spoiler system so not sure if I got the tag right. There are no spoilers in this post but there are in the wikis and their annotations.

I've been working on something I think you'll all find very intriguing: converting articles from the [Westeros](http://awoiaf.westeros.org), [Ice and Fire](http://iceandfire.wikia.com), and [Game of Thrones](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com) wikis into annotations on [xyAnnotations](https://annotations.xyfir.com/sets/42451), which can be integrated directly into ebooks and viewed in just about any ebook reader. It's really neat being able to just tap on a name or phrase or location within a book and have the wiki articles already loaded and available to view right there.

I made a [short video](https://youtu.be/0j7Ly8_vg6Y) demonstrating it in action, and if you'd like to give it a try, I'd recommend starting [here](https://annotations.xyfir.com/sets/42451/read). I've also been working on creating annotations from other wikis for these and other popular books. You can see some of the annotations on my [xyAnnotations profile](https://annotations.xyfir.com/users/1).

As you can see, I've got a large part of the main articles transferred over, thanks to the [automated tool](https://github.com/Xyfir/annotate/tree/master/cli) I built. However, because it _is_ automated, there are some things that aren't quite right and I'd love to get some help improving the converted annotations. I need to do things like remove annotations that will never be highlighted within books, remove sections that are not relevant in the annotation format, fix searches so that more aliases are highlighted within books, and much more. Additionally, I also need help adding books, their covers, and their metadata to the xyAnnotations books database.

I'm a moderator on all of the ASOIAF and GRRM books and annotation sets on xyAnnotations so I can accept your changes or even make you a moderator as well if you're willing, able, and trustworthy. It'd be great to have some of the trusted members here moderating the related books and sets of annotations on xyAnnotations. There are a lot of books and series and authors I'm working on annotating so it's hard for me to properly manage all of these annotations and books without any help.

So if any of the ASOIAF fans or scholars here are interested in helping out, just let me know and I can point you in the right direction. If you're just looking to get these annotations into your ebooks and are having trouble, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help.",gameofthrones,True,1528302262,2018-06-06

[SPOILERS] The Night King is not pure evil. - NK Predictions for Season 8,"The Night King is not pure evil.  His goal is to restore his own humanity and reverse the curse the Children of the Forest put on him.  In order to do this, he needs to destroy the magic that binds him to this curse.  The only way to do this is to destroy the Three-Eyed Raven and the CotF.  This has always been his goal, but it has not been even remotely possible to actualize until the end of season 1 when he sees the red comet, signaling the presence of fire magic (dragons) again in the world, giving him hope that he could finally complete his mission of destroying the wall and moving south to the God’s Eye (where it all started).  So, he makes the TER his first priority and mobilizes his army to the Weirwood tree north of the wall.  

The Three Eyed Raven was always going to be the first step in completing the Night King's goal of revenge and restoration, which is why the TER has been protected by the Children of the Forest (and magic) for centuries. The TER’s warging and greenseeing abilities (not to mention being a source of magical power for the CotF) make TER the biggest initial threat to the NK. Only with the TER out of the way can the NK take on the CotF and accomplish his goal.  So, the NK attacks the Weirwood in season 6, destroying Brynden Rivers and is now after the new TER, Bran Stark. 

The Battle of Winterfell will be about protecting Bran (and ultimately the CotF who now reside on the Isle of Faces).  Most of the wights and WW are destroyed, and there will be many deaths in this battle, but the NK will leave several survivors; his intent is not to kill for killing’s sake. Bran, however, will die. NK’s intent for the dragon, Viserion, becomes clear as he can now get across the water to the Isle of Faces, where he hopes to confront the last CotF and restore his humanity.  

This is where I believe the NK will be destroyed by Jon Snow, most likely fulfilling the prophecy of Azor Ahai.  JS must forge his sword in fire, which is Daenarys’s heart.  Then, he is able to kill the NK, protecting the CotF.

Just opening up my predictions for discussion.  Any further thoughts?  Thanks!",gameofthrones,True,1528312932,2018-06-06

"[NO SPOILERS] Can anyone explain to me what's the story behind ""The Rains of Castamere""?","I get that the song sings about the downfall of a certain family by the Lannisters, I'm just confused of the lyrics.

***""And who are you,""*** **The Proud Lord said,** ***""that I must bow so low?""*** \&lt; I'm guessing The Proud Lord is the Lord of Castamere? Is he talking to a Lannister? If so, then does this mean the Lannister is threatening or telling the Lord of Castamere to bow before him and the Lord got angry?

***""Only a cat of a different coat is all the truth I know""*** \&lt; My guess is the Lord of Castamere is telling the Lannister that he only acknowledges another family whose sigil is also a cat? albeit a different coat or color

***""And a coat of Gold, a coat of red, a lion still has claws. And mine are long and sharp my lord, as long and sharp as yours.""***\&lt; Is this the Lannister responding to the Lord? Saying that even though their coat is red, they're still the same as the Lord of Castamere's. He's saying that his family is as strong as the Lord's.

**And so he spoke, and so he spoke; that Lord of Castamere** \&lt; So this is the Lord Of Castamere going off on the Lannister, seemingly angry at the Lannister's claim. He's shouting and shouting at the Lannister.

**But now the rains weep o'er his halls, with no one there to hea\*\*\*\*r** \&lt; I guess this is way later? After the Lord of Castamere ranted at the Lannister, he (Lannister) commenced with the rebellion (or massacre) and killed the entire Castameres? This line is depicting that now no one is occupying the halls of Castamere Castle now that everyone is dead.

Idk, tell me what you guys think. I'm more interested in the lyrics and what they depict.",gameofthrones,True,1528315517,2018-06-06

[SPOILERS] Who/What is the lord of light? Theories? Ideas? Here's mine...,"I'm not sure what theories are out there, but I can't wait to find out!

Is the LOL (lord of light this post) a good entity or an evil one? IF LOL is good, than is the many faced god the bad god, like the devil?

My thoughts: I think that we will find out that the LOL has some kind of physical form, like someone is actually the LOL. I've also thought in the past that the LOL is really an evil entity or bad god, like the devil, because remember that black demon thing that the Red Priest birthed in front of Ser Daavos? That was definitely something evil. So maybe the LOL is really the night king or some other evil thing. LOL sounds good because light=good usually, but I think that is to deceive us. I back this ""devil"" theory up with an example from biblical stories: remember Lucifer means light, satan used to be the most beautiful angel of light in heaven until he fell from god's grace. So maybe the LOL thing is an adaption of the devil concept. If this is true, than who/what represents the good? Jon Snow? I mean he has been resurrected just like Jesus Christ was. He is good through and through and has been a savior to many people already.

[SPOILERS] Stuff that could happen....,"GrrM introduced a lot of tools into his world that *could* be paid off in terms of twists later. The Game of Thrones writers included these mechanisms to some degree so I was just thinking of a few that may pay off at some point...some things that could factor in the final episodes...

1) A little earlier someone questioned ""who will be brought back as a White Walker?"" Good question and since we have seen the NK dramatically raise people from the dead including some Wildlings at Hardhome we liked. I think dramatically it would be cool and also make sense for the story for him to raise a character we all know and love as one of his servants. So I think at some point we may see a major character die onscreen during the war with the NK and come back and another character that (might have loved them) have to battle them. 

2) Faceless men - we have characters who can take faces and identities. I think at some point some character will switch (or have been switched out) to dramatic effect. Maybe Arya uses a disguise we don't realize until the last minute as she pulls something off or maybe Jaqen shows up one last time. But I think something could turn out to be not as it seems and allow for a fun sequence using this tool. A lot of time has been sent explaining what it means to be no one so I'd like to see how it works in practice. Its also possible someone has been 'no one' all along. (tin foily but isn't that the point of having disguises)

3) Time travel - Bran effected Hodor and he was the way he was in part because of Bran. I do think this will come to pass in some form that Bran using his abilities will have already caused (accidentally or even on purpose) something that is occurring in the past that leads to the current events in an important way. it will be confusing but I think anything Bran has done has already been done (the ink is dry, as the Three Eyed Raven pointed out) but that doesn't mean Bran wasn't the one who wrote it from the present. So I do think we will get a moment where some things link together through Bran.

4) Beric - We know how his story and Catelyn's was changed from the books. I do think at some point the lord of lights ability to resurrect will be used one final time on a needy character.

5) Warging - The wolves have been given some short shrift which is a shame because I would have liked to see Drogon meet Ghost. But warging with animals is something we have seen earlier on but hasn't really had a major impact on the narrative so far with the changes they have made to eliminate some of it but it has been clearly explained and set up. Many thought Jon would escape his death at the Wall using warging but he didn't. I think the elements are there for it to be used one last time in the show either to call for help or to give a character one last shot at life by warging into another being.  

6) Wolves - speaking of wolves, this might not be likely, we know the CGI budget isn't big enough for dragons and wolves apparently and fur is a nightmare to render but I do hope the wolves show up in the end and bring the story full circle in a big showing. Not so much a concept that can lead to a story point like the others, just something cool that has been set up (sparingly) that I think could pay off in the final battle. Hopefully they get together some budget for the wolves to come riding in at some point.

Visiting Northern Ireland in July...,"Hey, all!   


Long time fan, first time (maybe?) poster. Anyways, I'm traveling to Europe next month and was supposed to spend a few days in London but thinking of ditching that and taking a flight up to Belfast to visit a few GoT locations. I had a few questions since this will be my first time in Ireland and Europe as a whole. So I was wondering what would be the best locations to visit in a fairly quick amount of time. Should I rent a car and are all locations easy to reach? I'll be there July 5th and 6th so it won't be entirely long. Oh, and does anyone know if the show will still be filming by that time? I know they are filming now so I'm crossing my fingers they still will be by that time.  


Any help would be greatly appreciated. Can't wait for the trip and for S8! ",gameofthrones,True,1528403707,2018-06-07
[NO SPOILERS] A fun little detail I picked up with Jon and Drogon,"Excuse me for my bad English.

So in class I learned some animals use their vomeronasal organ or Jacobson’s organ to detect chemical stimuli while smelling. A stallion uses this organ to detect if a mare is ready to mate in a response called flehmen in which it curls back its upper lip exposing its fronth teeth. I was watching a video which showed a clip op Drogon smelling Jon Snow ([http://prntscr.com/js91cf](http://prntscr.com/js91cf)). This was just something I saw and made me think that this was a nice detail where Drogon curls back its upper lip and exposing its teeth and maybe smelling more then just the his blood. If i’m wrong you can correct me I just used information I saw in class and thought this was a fun little detail.",gameofthrones,True,1528404685,2018-06-07
GRRM GOT characters you want to know more about!!,"Hi reddit world- first post ever! And its a new thread- lol! :P

GRRM is so good at fleshing out characters. he creates intrigue in a variety of ways with descriptors that beg to be studied further. I especially love his profuse use of handicaps, or physical detriments in his characters, that imo illustrates a world where people are damaged and carry burdens. He's also fantastic at playing with tropes and even further has an genuine gift for evolving characters in fantastic ways in a method that still makes their development plausible and believable. I am enamored with his character creations!!

So my question is what minor characters have you heard about that you want to get the full GRRM on? Ive got one but its pretty vague and I was going to hold on to it until I heard a few from other people on here. Hint: its pretty obscure- think he gets a paragraph or two in DWD in a daenarys chapter- lol! Also he gets more ink but Im really sucked into the Roose Bolton mystery and still fanatically holduing out for the ""Bolt-On Theory"" to come true, at least in ink (where all the best stuff happens).

Anyways Im currently on my 3rd full read and am more sucked into this world than ever- haha! Ftr I strongly reccomend a second read as soooo much really comes through the second time. Im only reading it a third time because his prose and storytelling are like heroin fopr me now :P Im doing the King of Thorns triolgy and I keep picking up DWD instead- lmao!! Anyways Im getting side tracked- WHAT CHARACTERS DO YOU NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT???",gameofthrones,True,1528407161,2018-06-07

Dragon Glass is obsiden, which is made from volcanic glass, so couldn't Valerian Steel be forged with something just as hot, such as dragon fire?

If memory serves me right, Valeria was home to many dragons so it wouldn't be crazy to think they used them for a few purposes, this one included. Everything we know thus far leads us to believe Dragon Fire is the key ingredient to making Valerian Steel.",gameofthrones,True,1528420416,2018-06-07

Basic example, Maester Aemon commenting, poor Danaerys, she’s only the Targaryen left in the world besides me...boom Cut to Jon walking in the room. Obviously one of many. This Has me thinking, is religious phrase of Valar Morghulis the biggest foreshadow of what’s to come? Ned, robert, Robb, Joffrey, Tommen, Rickon, Tywin, viserys, Littlefinger, Stannis, Renly, Mance. All significant and dead. Thinking this means Jon, Tyrion, Jaime and Bran share the same fate eventually.

[Spoilers] What deal do you think was agreed upon in the last episode?,"OK so I tried to make the title of this as spoiler-free as possible.

I just rewatched the final episode of Season 7 and I can't help but really wonder what deal Tyrion and Cersei struck to allow Cersei to let Tyrion walk out of that room without being murdered in cold blood.

It's got to be something big, right? Because we know Cersei has no intention of honoring any deal they made and I assume Tyrion knows this. He had to have offered her something that he believes she would actually take and that Dany would actually agree to.

Because of this, we know it can't involve Cersei staying in power. That's not going to happen as Dany would never agree to it.

We also know it can't possibly involve Dany taking the throne as Cersei would never agree to it and, if she did, Tyrion would automatically call BS and know she was lying.

Maybe he agreed that Cersei, Jamie and their child gets to live when Dany takes control? I doubt this would work because Tyrion knows Cersei will never give up power and would die trying to keep the thrones.

So what is it then? 

Is Tyrion going to take out Jon Snow? To me, that seems like a true possibility as he would see it as a strategic move to placate Cersei but ultimately not cost Dany the crowd. And it's vengeful enough that I could believe Tyrion thought Cersei would find that an acceptable deal.

Or maybe Tyrion has pledged to allow Cersei's child to take the throne after Dany? There was a lot of talk about succession in Season Seven between those two characters. 

We know Tyrion isn't going to turn on Dany (at least not at this point.) We know Cersei won't trust or fear Dany so what deal could possibly work for everyone involved? 

Interested to head your thoughts.

[Spoilers] - Theories about Craster's Sons...,"I have some half theories around Craster and I am interested to see if anyone has any insights….

First off, Craster’s home is pretty far away from the Land of Always Winter. WWs could steal babies much easier from wilding settlements closer like the Thann. Also, it seems like the point of grabbing the babies is that they are alive (otherwise they would become Wights not WWs) and the logistics of this means that the babies have to be picked up by WWs relatively soon after Craster leaves them. How would the NK know a few days ahead of time that Craster’s daughter is about to give birth, so one of the WWs should leave now to be around Craster’s Keep in a couple of nights to grab the child? Also, how would they know it was going to be boy and not a girl? This whole situation implies a lot. We know that WWs are not wandering around regularly near the wall, because at the beginning very few Rangers are really taking the rumours of WWs seriously. This all really makes sense if the NK has greensight, otherwise, I just don’t understand how they could have a WW in the right place, at the right time. I also think the fact he chooses Craster’s children instead of just pillaging wilding settlements really proves the theory that the WWs are way more than just mindless tools of destruction. It would be annoying to battle with your neighbours and steal their children. It might even result in them trying to rescue said children, so the WWs obviously think the easiest path is to just take the unwanted children Craster provides. Again, if destruction is your game then you wouldn’t value life and wouldn’t care either way. 

Also, how did the whole situation come about? I doubt the NK showed up at Craster’s one day asking if he could have his sons going forward and then they had some nice southern wine and watched the fire for a bit. The most likely theory is that Craster starts putting the sons out simply because he is trash bag of a human being, and then one morning someone notices that the baby’s body is gone. Craster is curious about what happened (or paranoid that one of the daughters snuck out and saved it) so the next time he waits after he drops the baby. He sees the WW grab it. This is where I think it went two possible ways. The least likely is that Craster actual has a convo with the WW about the babies, and the WW promises that if Craster continues to sacrifice babies he will be spared in the upcoming war. The more likely theory is that the WW says nothing, but also doesn’t try to kill Craster, just turns around and leaves with the child. Craster is a fool, so he assumes that they are gods (wildings seem more willing to believe the magical nature of things) and that sacrificing his children must be pleasing them. He runs with this assumption going so far when the Night’s Watch shows up to brag that he will be spared in the coming war. So Craster just creates his ‘pact’ with the WWs from his own assumptions/imagination. 

Either way the whole situation with Craster sticks out to me as very odd. All we see (especially in the show) is the repeated narrative that WWs are this undead zombie army that just wants to destroy. Even one of the GOT show creators said recently that the NK’s just wants death. Yet, with Craster’s baby swap they employ serious restraint by choosing to take Craster’s ‘given’ children instead of stealing wilding babies. It also proves they are able to employ some level of greensight and organization/planning. If they are just about destroying then why would they act like rational beings with a planned purpose only when it comes to Craster’s children? 

I have one more tin-foil theory about the whole thing. In my search for answers, I found out that Craster is the bastard son of a wilding woman and member of the Night’s Watch. It said somewhere that the mother went to Castle Black and tried to get the father to take responsibility but she was chased off. You never find out who the father was. The Night’s Watch has a long history of random nobles ending up there. Could it be that there is something about Craster’s blood? The Red Witch was a big believer in the power of royal blood, and there are a lot of parallels between the Red Witch and the WWs. Maybe the reason they want Craster’s children is because of their blood, because their blood allows them to turn into WWs when touched? The Starks, for instance, are known to have green sight in their family tree, and the Targs have visions etc. So it could be less about royal blood and more about magical power inherited through the blood? I have tried to look back through the Night’s Watch history to see if anyone would have ended up in the Watch at the right time but can’t find anyone special that makes sense.

Secondly, Sam stole Heartsbane on the way to the Citadel so he has the ancestral sword which basically saved it from being melted by dragon fire.

[SPOILERS] Daemon - Mini-series,"*(Spoilers just to have everything out there to talk about)*

With the world of ASOIAF gaining traction on multiple fronts for new shows, this is personally at the top of my list and one that I think covers the Dance of the Dragons, but from the best possible perspective and through one of the coolest more mysterious characters (death wise) in the entire anthology. Also, you've got ""The Rogue Prince"" to build from already which is an awesome starting point.

It's just called: **Daemon** (or maybe ""The Rogue Prince"")

As a precurser, I'm not likely the first to propose this and probably not the last. I just think this little pocket in time is ideal. Far enough away from GoT that it is it's own thing while also being close enough that there's clear parallels and easter eggs to the show.

John Adams/Band of Brothers style. Just think of all the elements...you have Rhaenyra, House Hightower &amp; Velaryan with a presence (new), Criston Cole as a huge part, Addam V, Nettles, Aegon II, his Stepstones shenanigans, the Dance of the Dragons, Dark Sister, Ceraxes, the list goes on.

Also, the most epic climax towards his end (or maybe not bc his body was never found): The Battle Above the God's Eye. Imagine that on screen.

It would be one thing to follow along all the working parts of the Dance as is always mentioned, but I think his arc actually encapsulates the war in a nice way and does even more from a story wise perspective.

[spoilers] history of Westeros probably full of lies,"Time and again people have had theories that the history we were told was lies, manipulated by the COTF. Now that we know Westeros has a “horrifying history” and it “isn’t what we thought” we know there is more to it. The fact they’re bothering to create a whole show about it proves most of those who dismissively quoted lines characters regurgitated from legends we were told were suspect about the history as if it were a closed topic were likely wrong. When the show ends it will likely have a shocker that will lead us to want to understand how the whole story was set up. In this way the shows will be connected.

There probably is more to the concept that the history is a lie. The fact the COTF lied once about making the WW was dismissed as a small lie and they were seen as repentant due to the NK killing one of them and one helping Bran, and the WWs only got out of their control. The cave paintings Jon saw are more propaganda to convince man they are friends. If they’re doing a prequel the age of heroes is more complex and man was likely manipulated more than they know.

Anything you hope gets addressed in the end? 

What did Varys hear in the flames?

What is Varys true motivation?

Why did Jojen Reed take Bran to the/become Three Eyed Raven?

What became of Crasters converted babies?

We spent a lot of time on Theon...show me what you got Theon...not a question but I want to see why we spent so much time...

What is the Mountain now? 

What is going on with Cersei's body?

Why does R'hllor show Melisandre visions that she failed to interpret correctly, where do these visions come from? Stannis was a big waste of her time or it was purposeful...but what is the purpose of R'hllor.

How did the White Walkers turn on the COTF?

Why did Jaqen H'ghar take pity on Arya and why did keeping her name Arya Stark and not becoming ""no one"" satisfy him?

Why must ""all men die"" is it just a statement on the mortality of man or something more?

Why do the Starks warn ""winter is coming?""

Why must ""there always be a Stark in winterfell.""

Why did Rhaegar and Lyanna keep in hiding and let her family think she was taken? I want a little more on what was going on with them other than the wedding and she is bloody in a bed with a baby...

Why name Jon the same name as his dead son, (theories aside) I would like to see that...

Bran changed the past once, is something else changed we don't yet know about, what does Hodor foreshadow if anything?

[SPOILERS] My predictions for Arya Stark,"So today I wanted to start doing predictions for each of the characters arcs next season (or atleast what they will be up too), NOT all of them obviously but I will do the ones I am interested in doing, the first one will be about Arya Stark. Now before we get this out of the way I think in order for people to take Arya's character seriously again they need NEED to Retcon the Winterfell plotline into having it be that she was testing Sansa/pushing her to not trusting LF by pretending to act out at her like that (if this is the case though then good).

Now that I got that out of the way let's begin, I believe that Arya's arc next season will not only be about Humanizing and leaving her vengeful ways but also to learn to keep her control as she will have to get use to people coming to WF she may not like. Jaime for obvious reasons, Varys because she did hear her in the Red Keep conspiring with Illyrio, Beric also for obvious reasons, Theon for all the stuff he did to WF Pre-Reek, and Dany. Yes I think she will have a problem with Jon bending the knee, because yes while she loves Jon and will stick by her side she is going to have a problem with him not only giving up the North to someone she only knows as the Mad King's Daughter (I.E the man who killed her Uncle and Grandfather) but also that he is getting help from Cersei forces.

However I think the first person she will have a reunion with in WF is Gendry (whom I think will be the first to arrive into WF). I think they will have a heartwarming reunion which will lead to them Bonding in the crypts, Anyways when Jon arrives she will have a heartfelt reunion with him (maybe Jon will ask if she stick them with the Pointy end) however like I said when she sees Dany she I think she will have a problem with Jon bending the knee and especially to the Mad King' Daughter. Plus on top of that getting Cersei's help with her and Sansa stating Cersei can not be trusted, However she will later realize Jon and Dany are in love (weather it is thanks to Bran or not that is a different story), and also Bran shows Arya and Sansa some of the good things he did for the Slaves of Essos and will grow to like her.

Arya will also have her reunion with the Hound and have to deal with people she does not like (Jaime, Beric, Varys, Theon, and possibly Mel) being in WF. Also I think Jon will confront her about the Bag of faces and what happened between her and Sansa last season and she will explain what she really did and also what she whined through. Anyways when the battle comes up we will see Arya kill a WW and save Gendry from a WW and a Wight Snow Leopard. Gendry will die in her arms and they will admit there feelings for each other. Beric will push her aside and give Gendry the kiss of life bringing him back, and Arya and Gendry share a passionate kiss. 

The two will head to the Riverlands after the battle where Arya reveals she is going to go to KL to kill Cersei once and for all for what she did (if you don't know I think Euron and GC will surprise attack WF and kidnapped some people (Varys, Tyrion, and Sansa) which will drive Arya to do this) Gendry decides to tag along. They run into Jaime, The Hound, Pod, and Brienne who are on a mission themselves send by Jon to deal with Cersei. When they make it to KL they camp outside the city while Gendry and Arya sneak in via the sewers.

I think once there they'll attend Cersei and Euron's wedding to find out what they did to Sansa with Arya sporting a disguise similar to what Lyanna whore on her wedding day (but not to lady like though something that still fits with Arya's character as a warrior). They find out Sansa and Tyrion are still hostages and Varys has turned up missing. Anyways the next day they will go into the red Keep to deal with Cersei while NK battles Jon and Dany in the skies and Euron goes up against Theon &amp; Yara's fleet. Arya sneaks in through the front gates with her FM skills and Jaime, Brienne, Pod, The Hound, and Gendry sneak in through the sewers.

Arya gets the chance to kill Cersei but chooses family over vengeance going to free Sansa &amp; Tyrion and letting Jaime kill Cersei instead. In the end of it all Arya will finally be free of her Vengeful side and decides to either sail to lands more west with some refugees with Gendry by her side or she marries Gendry and becomes Lady of Stormlands.",gameofthrones,True,1527023363,2018-05-22

"[NO SPOILERS] Gamdias Ares P1 6 zone RGB Gaming Membrane Keyboard with 21-key Rollover, 8 Additional Multi-media Keys (Ares P1)","https://twitter.com/XpertsSolusion/status/997921446683852800

This is an awesome keyboard and mouse combo! I've been using them for about a week now and I love the feel and the sound of the keyboard. The keys have a light but responsive touch to them, they are a bit noisy (if you were to use them in an office setting) but perfect for my home use and gaming.

From a gaming perspective, I generally play FPS or Simulators and so far its worked out great. No complaints from the gaming site.

If I had to give it one critique, it would be that my typos have increased as you barely have to push a key for it to enter it; however, this is more about me learning to type on a mech keyboard rather than dragging my fingers around on a traditional keyboard.

The keyboard and mouse came in a great box that protected them well. The cords on both are about 6ft in length and work perfect for me as I have the tower underneath my desk.

[Spoilers] Need help building a setting for a D&amp;D campaign,"I've been reading through The Wprld of Ice &amp; Fire book, and as our current campaign is wrapping up, I'd like do so one set in this world. The players and I like the idea of the adventure party being hedge knights or knights in the service of some small lord or noble in Westeros. This would allow them to participate in tourneys, bandit hunting, small and large scale battles, diplomacy, exploration-  you name it! There's even the chance to travel to Essos, Sothoryos, and the lands to the far east. 



I'm thinking that the best timeline for this would be after Aegon's Conquest, as tourneys and knights were (in my opinion) at their peak popularity. Had we started in Essos, I would have liked to do it pre-Doom of Valyria, since magic and dragons were everywhere. As for the setting, I was thinking maybe somewhere in The Reach or The Stormlands, because of their proximity to Dorne, which is a favorite among our friends. They also have rich history, as most places do, and very cool climates and landscapes.


That being said, I was hoping you folks could help me out with some possible scenarios. Do you recommend a different region?  What are your favorite minor houses? Any rivalries to use? Any events that take place there, characters to run into, plot elements that could pop up.... that sort of thing. I've never ran a game of D&amp;D before so if you have any experience with that, I'd love some tips. Thanks for your help!",gameofthrones,True,1527110903,2018-05-23

Men’s laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove you are not mine.” I didn’t realize they made it so obvious in the show Tywin doesn’t believe Tyrion is his child.

[SPOILERS] An interesting S3 Scene illustrates the false dichotomy between Robb/Tywin.,"For the first 3 seasons Robb and Tywin are somewhat presented as opposites.                  
Robb is young, pure and just, spares the innocent, and his bannerman follow him out of respect.                 
Tywin is old, brutal, and harsh, many of his bannerman follow him out of fear.                       
But what led Tywin to become this way? Why is Robb not this way. \[This\]\([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1uEdHna\-ys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1uEdHna-ys)\) scene I believe illustrates Robb's first steps to \*\*becoming Tywin\*\*. The karstarks killed children yes, but more importantly \*they disobeyed Robb's order\*. The one who begs for mercy? \*\*""Hang him last so he can watch"" Robb says.\*\* This is brutality that Tywin would nod and raise his cup to. Listen to the anger in Robb's voice and the rage in his eyes. Some of this is surely out of love for the dead, but this guy is angry at those who disobeyed him. How long until the stab him in his sleep?                 


Tywin is the way he is because in the harsh scarcity world of Ice and Fire, Brutal is often a synonym of Wise. Tywin has learned this through 35 years of ruling millions of men and women. Tywin has learned that brutality produces results, loyalty is good but when it doesn't work fear is all you have. Robb is only now starting to learn this, and he learned it too late.               
I feel this scene illustrates that the primary difference between Tywin and Robb is experience. To quote Tywin himself ""He is so young that he doesn't know enough to be afraid"". If Robb had another 20 years of commanding millions of men and trying to balance their disdain for each other, he would be remember this moment, be paranoid of it happening again. He would be harsh, and firm, threatening, and stop the karstarks before the idea entered their head by any means necissary. Just like Tywin.            ",gameofthrones,True,1527129895,2018-05-23

[Everything] The Prince That Was Promised CHANGE MY MIND,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1527234071,2018-05-25
[SPOILERS] The Prince That Was Promised,"I laid out a theory a while back that still hasn’t gotten traction, but here it goes again— it’s become canon in my head, and I think it’s the best interpretation:

The Prince That Was Promised...was promised to the Night. 

There isn’t really a good reason mankind should win this war. They’ve talked about it the whole time about how futile it actually is. So...mankind doesn’t win. Instead, the Night King, on the verge of annihilating the world of the living comes to the surviving heroes and demands his prize: The Prince That Was Promised, a child of royal blood—the true heir to the throne, the prince born to Daenerys Targaryen and Jon— to be the new Night’s King with the passing of the last. 

Dany will have become pregnant in the new season, seemingly defeating the prophecy of Mirri Maz Duur.  But the witch will have been proven true in the end. As the Night’s army surrounds the survivors, the Night King will point to Dany’s belly and Jon will (with tremendous gnashing of teeth and brooding), plunge his sword into his true love to pull out mankind’s salvation— the royal baby sacrifice that will Bring Light back to the world, just like when Azor Ahai killed Nissa Nissa to save the world before (and hence never bearing a living child).  Because who says ancient stories cannot be allegories? Do we really believe old Azor Ahai killed all the Night’s Army with one awesome sword and saved mankind? Then...why is there still a Night’s King? Because the army was never defeated by Azor Ahai, just turned back once they got what they came for. 

It would tie in a lot of the themes of the story— Sacrifice and Duty for the greater good as a sign of true leadership, the power of royal blood, the bittersweetness of the whole world, the breaking of the wheel (no more heirs to the throne), mothers dying at childbirth, Night and Light, Death and Life being sides of the same coins, and of course, the importance of PROMISES. 

So, did I ruin the ending for you, or can you change my mind?

[SPOILERS] Something I may have noticed,"Remember in the famous 5th episode of season 6 (the one with Hold the Door), Well you know how the NK touched the ground around the Weirwood where Bran and the 3ER where to break the force field, Well I thought maybe he could do something similar like that to bring down the wall but on a bigger scale. However that was not the case as the NK brought down the Wall via the Ice Dragon/Reanimated Viserion. However I was thinking what if that was not what they where forshadowing in that moment in S6?

Because they would not have the NK use the power on the force field around the 3ER tree if it wasn't going to be used again so maybe the NK is saving to use the power again for something more grand. What if the NK is going to use the power again except on a bigger scale on a possible magical barrier around WF?

[Spoilers] S4 E7 Mockingbird and S8 WF burning pics theory,"So I was rewatching GoT, as a fan does, and the scene from Mockingbird where Sansa makes a snow castle Winterfell caught my attention.

Before Robin has his tantrum and stomps the snow castle Sansa tells him that:

""My family doesn't live there anymore and SOMEONE BURNED IT DOWN.""

Robin then creepily looks down at it.

Winterfell certainly wasn't burned down, put to the torch sure but not burned down.

With Robin's favorite person... uncle... step-dad...dad(?) now dead is it a stretch to think that he'll have huge ****-fit over it?

We haven't seen Robin in the North but I'm willing to bet he is there camped out with his Knights of the Vale. We know Royce was no fan of LF but I'm willing to bet his sense of honor wouldn't stop him from carrying out his Lord's commands for vengeance by actually burning Winterfell down.

I dont think the Knights of the Vale, specifically Robin, are on the page with Jon and the North vs the Army of the Dead. In Robin's mind he just did the Starks a huge solid by helping them beat the Boltons and for them to kill Petyr will probably leave him with a huge sense of betrayal.

Sorry if my grammar is bad, I've got a bad case of TBI but I had to get this theory out of my head. I haven't seen this theory before after a few days of thinking it over.

but in S6, when Ned confronts Ser Arthur Dayne, and he gets stabbed by Howland Reed, Ned seizes the opportunity to kill him. Ned, the honorable man, killed him unfairly.

Robert became the rightful king because in Westeros, right of conquest supersedes all claims to the throne.

[SPOILERS] S7E6 Beyond the Wall: Big Realization upon rewatch,"I just finished rewatching the penultimate episode of season 7 and I noticed something that many people might not have picked up on. 

During the part where Jon, Tormund, etc are surrounded North of the Wall, Gendry runs back to Eastwatch to send a Raven to Daenerys, there is seemingly not enough time for her to make it in time to save them. Upon rewatching the episode, it clearly shifts from day to night and back again 2 or maybe even 3 times. 

I could see this being enough time passing (with some slight suspension of belief still, I’ll admit) for Dany to receive the Raven and fly north. 

The insane time lapse used by the writers to make everything seemed insane to me and to a lot of people I think but noticing this made me feel a little bit better about the execution of such an important part in the show. 

What do you guys think? I’m probably not the first to point this out on here but it was pretty big in my opinion. ",gameofthrones,True,1527449915,2018-05-27

Is Season 8 going to be as bad as Season 7?,"I hope this doesn't ruffle any feathers, but when Season 7 aired I was in the middle of sort of breaking off my habit of watching TV shows for a hobby but because GoT held a special place in my heart I watched it anyway. 

And I noticed that it just... wasn't as good as the past seasons. I figured this was a blessing in disguise and that I would just end my show watching career with this, but lately I've been thinking about GoT again and just how fun it was to watch the show. It was the first show I ever really got hooked on like that that I felt was actually good on so many levels.

I'd like to watch the new season when it comes out but... will it be just like the last season? This new refound interest comes because I was really bored one day a few weeks ago and played Crusader Kings 2 because I'd downloaded it on a whim when it was free and never touched it. But after a day or two of playing I found out it had a GoT mod and played that it was really, really fun. 

Since then I've wanted to rewatch the series over and relive the show but then of course I began getting excited at the thought of Season 8, but I'd rather not if that excitement is only going to become disappointment. ",gameofthrones,True,1527492605,2018-05-28
[Spoilers] The dragonpit summit,"At the season 7 finale meeting at the Dragonpit, many of the principal players meet face to face. Most of them had previously done grievous harm to one another. Let’s start with the kings and queens. Queen Danaerys’ father was killed by Jaime Lannister, now the General of Queen Cersei’s forces. Cersei’s father was killed by Tyrion, hand to Queen Danaerys. King/warden Snow’s Stark family was killed by the Lannisters. His grandfather and uncle were killed by the mad king Aerys. The Hound and the Mountain are mortal enemies. Brienne ‘s liege lord Renly was killed by machination of Stannis in which Seaworth played a part. Everyone else that she had sworn to serve (Catelyn, Sansa, Arya) had been harmed by Cersei. Cersei had attempted to kill Tyrion many times. Jon Snow and his sisters had destroyed Cersei’s allies , the Boltons and the Freys. Mormont’s life was forfeit as a slaver in the eyes of the North. Yet they were all at the same place to try for a truce to fight the true enemy. What does it say about all these people that it was only Cersei who didn’t care to bury the hatchet at the end of the summit?",gameofthrones,True,1527511381,2018-05-28

[SPOILERS] Who do you think will rule the various kingdom of Westeros at the end of the show?,"It's obvious Cersei will be defeated, and either Jon or Daenerys will sit on the throne. But who will rule the other 7 Kingdoms once the show is finished? 3 major houses are extinct, so it's difficult to say.

THE CROWN - House Targaryen (Jon or Daenerys)
THE NORTH - House Stark (Sansa if Jon takes the throne)
THE WESTERLANDS - House Lannister (Tyrion. I think Jaime and Cersei will both die)
THE REACH - Not sure at all, as we don't know if there are other Tyrells still alive. Maybe Sam, as he is a Tarly?
THE STORMLANDS - House Baratheon is extinct. Maybe Jon will legitimize Gendry, but other than that I'm not sure.
THE VALE - House Arryn, under the regency of House Royce
THE RIVERLANDS - House Tully. Edmure is still alive, and has a son with Roselyn. I think he'll be restored as ruler over the Riverlands because House Frey is mostly extinct.
DORNE - Again, not sure, as everybody who could rule it is either dead or imprisoned. Maybe a minor house will take power.
THE IRON ISLANDS - I'd say Yara will be rescued by Theon, Euron will be killed and she will be named Queen.

[SPOILERS] Accurate Portrayal of Genes (Potential Proof of Popular Theories),"The targaryen natural hair color is ash blonde. This is maintained only and only when they keep the bloodline pure (Incest). Whenever they marry a non-targ, the targ hair genes become recessive and the non-targs hair genes become dominant.

Targaryens are like the reverse Baratheron. The Baratheon black hair genes are dominant consistently, which led the events in AGOT to happen.

There are significant proof in the World of Ice and Fire also. Every time a targ marry a non-targ, they're children hair favors the non-targ.

So, if Tyrion is a targ it makes sense. He has the Lannister blonde hair because of his mother. Also, Jon Snow has black hair of the Starks and not the blonde hair of Targaryens.",gameofthrones,True,1527525904,2018-05-28

[SPOILERS] My Predictions for Bran &amp; Sansa Stark,"Okay so this is my continuation of my predictions for each of the characters arcs for next season, Now before I start two things 1. I have done one for Arya already and i'll link it if you want to go check it out https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

2. I know some people were not huge fans of the Arya predictions and NO my predictions for Arya is to not try and redeem her because she is my Fav character. I do think she will go to some dark places next season but I don't think it will go too far. Plus there MY predictions not everything needs to be perfect. I only say because I do not plan on changing my predictions anytime soon.

Now let's begin, I'll start with Sansa since my predictions for her are pretty straight forward. With the Death of LF Sansa has finally FINALLY come into her own and is no longer a pawn in someone else's game, I also think this is a chance for the Showrunners to make up for last season by seeing the Stark sisters bound alittle more maybe Sansa even apologizes to Arya for being a pain to her in childhood. With that all said she will have a problem with Jon bending the knee to the Daughter of the Mad king and I think she will question Jon on his actions especially when Jon brings up getting help from Cersei, However Bran will show Arya and Sansa all the good things she did for the Slaves in Essos and see Dany is not that bad and of course she'll grow to like her more.

I also think Sansa will have a reunion with Tyrion and the Hound now weather or not she romantically bonds with one of them is another story (even though I kindof hope not, Especially since there both older then she is). Anyways when the big battle for the Dawn (the first battle anyways) comes around Sansa will be at WF helping everyone evacuate however when Euron, Strickland, and the GC attack she along with Varys and Tyrion get captured and taken to KL. When she is brought to the throne hall for her to be shown to Cersei we get a parallel moment to S2 when Joffrey has on her knees and is about to kill her, except this time around A. It's Cersei instead of Joffrey (obviously) and B. Sansa actually stands up to her and does not kneel but stands tall (also she is not crying).

Anyways afterwards she throws Tyrion and Sansa into the black cells while Varys is thrown into a different cell, Tyrion admits that he made a deal with Cersei and we pretty much finally learn what the cut scene from S7 was between Tyrion and Cersei (though i'll get into that when I do Tyrion) anyways Sansa gives him a motivational speech and Tyrion and Sansa hug. Anyways later Varys is said to be turned up missing and much later Arya comes in and saves her and Tyrion, they hug it out and explain everything that has happened. Sansa is given the North and made Queen of the North.

Okay now for Bran, So Bran one of my Fav characters (which would be shocking because you may think it's Arya but actually no it's Bran...Arya is my second Fav) though that may change alittle due to his behavior last season, but personally I think that is one of the side effects of not only having so much knowledge but also being away 3ER tree for too long and I think that will be explain in S8. Also I think Jaime and Theon will come and apologise to Bran for there actions against him. Bran will forgive both of them as that does not matter anymore (also I would like it if HR showed up but sadly I don't think he will at this point, even though he should).

Bran along with Sam will also tell Jon of his true parentage and then along with Sam and possibly Gilly and Little Sam will leave to the God's Eye prior to the Battle. Once there Bran will get all the knowledge he can about how to defeat the WW's and what they want, why did they return, and what does AA/TPTWP have to do with any of this including a flashback with Rhaegar (either Tourney at Harrenhal, Battle of the Trident, or something completely different we are not expecting). Anyways Jon I think will go to him to the God's Eye where Bran will reveal not only is he Lightbringer as Rhaegar was AA/TPTWP but also the WW's have returned due a combination of a Resurgence in Magic, Jon's birth, Them wanting to end the curse the children put on them, and them being threatened by the TLOL. 

Bran also informs Jon he must embrace his Targ side, He wargs into Rhaegal bringing him to the God's Eye as Jon gets on the Green Dragon. In the end they deal with the NK and Bran leaves Beyond the Wall possibly with some now turned human WW's. ",gameofthrones,True,1527539603,2018-05-28

In S1E4, the first time we see Gendry he tells Ned his mom had blonde hair and that she died of illness when he was still a baby.

[SPOILERS] I have a question regarding the loyalty of Denaerys' dragons?,"Namely Drogon but it applies to the others as well

In either season 4 or 5 I distinctly remember drogon literally snapping at her, and D along with the other dragons became very distant and less obedient during that time. Not only that, but D literally ran away, and she was forced to chain up her other 2 dragons. It seemed she had completely lost control of them

Then come season 6, and all of the sudden, Drogon is on her side again, saving her from the fighting pit and now once again obedient to her desires. This seemingly causes the other 2 dragons to be obedient as well, and now in season 7 they are following her to Westeros with unwavering loyalty, staying by the side of her fleet the entire time.

Did I miss something? did something happen that caused her to regain control of her dragons? or did Drogon finally just get bored of being wild and decide to go back to his mother?",gameofthrones,True,1527620180,2018-05-29
[NO SPOILERS] Why Winter is not coming,"L;DR: Economics

With the never ending delays of Winds of Winter, people are coming up with all kind of speculation why Martin can't get it done. But I think we're all missing the most obvious one (at least I've not seen anyone talk about it): economics. The problem is that finishing Winds of Winter is the least valuable thing he can do, speaking of potential revenue. No one is going to buy book 6 if they haven't read book 5 and Martin's total book sales in ASoIaF is, as far as I can tell, around 30 million copies across the entire series. The show, by contrast, was averaging 30 million viewers per episode. And that's not counting torrenting.
So if Martin writes book 6, then he can tap into how ever many people are making up that roughly 30 million book sales (and don't forget that after more than a decade, some of those people have moved on). But if he writes something from the universe (e.g. Fire and Blood) he has some subset of book owners as well as a subset of all the people who know the show (which could be up to 100 million people alone). Same story with spin offs of the series.
So I know it's not something any of us want to hear, but I think that it's a reality we need to face. The 6th book is never coming because there will always be something else he could be doing that will make him more money than book 6 will. And before you say ""but muh legacie!"", he knows he's never going to manage to complete the series no matter what he does, so why work so hard to get one more book when it does nothing for his legacy and doesn't offer the pay off that easier work will?",gameofthrones,True,1527621688,2018-05-29

I get that Brienne thinks the Hound is a bad guy, but its clear Arya doesnt want to go with her, and she basically removes the person protecting Arya, and since Arya doesnt know or trust Brienne, she is now alone, of course this works out for Arya in hindsight, but i think it is wrong of Brienne to fight the Hound.

[Mod Raven] Subreddit chat rooms and a group S6E10 rewatch this weekend,"***TL;DR: This subreddit has chat rooms now. You can join. We'll be rewatching S6E10 on Sunday at 18:00 GMT.***

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

**Chat rooms?**

The Chat Team at Reddit are testing Subreddit chat rooms, and this is one of the communities helping out. [Here's their post with more info.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/8g22a6/subreddit_chat_rooms_beta_has_been_released_to/) They're trying to work on involving communities more closely in the creation of features, and because we think chat rooms will be a fun thing for people during the on\-season especially, we're joining in. Chat rooms are still in their early stages with a lot of work to be done – so it's all about feedback at this stage.

**Does this mean bigger changes?**

Not really. It's a fun add\-on, but our focus is still mainly on posts and comments. In addition to the planned group rewatch, we're sure people will come up with other good chat ideas too.

**Do I have to participate/how do I join?**

Some of you will have access to chat already, others won't – it was random. If you're using the redesign and are subbed to the community, you might have noticed the rooms listed under the moderator list on the sidebar. You can join rooms from there. But nobody is forced to use this feature.

We'll leave a comment below if you're looking for an invite to the rooms.

**I have feedback to give – how can I do that?**

You can leave your feedback in this post, or submit your feedback to [r/community\_chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/community_chat) directly.

**How do chat rooms work?**

* If you’re whitelisted you can access chat rooms in our sidebar \(redesign only\) or you can open chat \(you will have a chat icon next to your mail icon\) and you will have a new “Rooms” tab which will allow you to view and join our rooms
* Anyone can be invited to chat rooms, so if you want to be in a room then someone that is in the rooms can send you an invite and you’ll automatically be whitelisted
* Our subreddit rules still apply – be mature, respectful, and don't post spoilers in the \[No Spoilers\] channel.
* This is only available on web, but a mobile version will be coming in June
* Don’t be suprised if rooms appear, disappear, etc. We’re working with the admins and in some cases we’ll be bringing down the rooms or recreating them for various reasons that may arise

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

**And this rewatch...**

We do weekly rewatches on our Discord. To test the chat feature, and for some entertainment, we'll be rewatching S6E10, The Winds of Winter, on Sunday at 18:00 GMT \(14:00 ET, 19:00 BST\). [You can click here to check what time it'll be where you are, if you're unsure.](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20180603T180000&amp;p1=137&amp;p2=179&amp;p3=213&amp;p4=136&amp;p5=195&amp;p6=176&amp;p7=240)

Whatever method of sourcing the episode you employ, we sync up by pausing on Peter Dinklage's name in the credits and then one of us counting down from 10.

We'd love to see some of you there to rewatch one of the highest\-rated episodes of the show, amid our long, dark off\-season...

[SPOILERS] A possible twist for Gendry,"So there are a lot of theories about who is Azor Ahai…Well was. Ever since season 7 people have been just bashing and destroying the idea non-stop hating the idea of a flaming sword, While yes I don’t think there will be a actual flaming sword per say I don’t think we should just throw away the idea of Azor Ahai just yet as it is possible we could still get something like it, and I believe one of the many candidates for Azor Ahai is Gendry. Yes I believe it is possible Gendry could still be Azor Ahai now why do I think this. Well I believe they brought back Gendry for a reason there has to be more to it then just fan service…oh and also to help Jon in the Wight Mission. I think he was brought back for a reason…That reason being he is Azor Ahai/The Prince that Was Promised.

Now how does he fit all the requirements? Well he was reborn admits Salt and Smoke from Dragonstone the smoke coming from the fire Mel put his blood in after he leeched him and the salt being the salty water around Dragonstone (the smoke could also refer to him joining the BWB), The Bleeding star is the Red Comet he was most likely under, Lightbringer is Catspaw I’ll explain how later, His great grandmother was a Targaryen meaning he has some Dragon Blood, and finally I could not find a strong connection to him and awakening Dragons which is the only thing I have going against him but hopefully he’ll fulfill that part. Now for Nissa Nissa I think Nissa Nissa is Arya in this case but I think there may be a twist with this. I think the Prophecy was misinterpreted and that in reality Nissa Nissa would bring his beloved a weapon, that weapon being Lightbringer and I think Catspaw is Lightbringer because it was in one of Sam’s books. I believe at some point the Dagger was enchanted by the Children and it would one day be used to end the WW’s. So Arya Gendry’s beloved would give him his weapon Catspaw/Lightbringer and he would defeat the NK with it. Now yes the AA will most likely be Jon or Dany but I would love it if Gendry was Azor Ahai.",gameofthrones,True,1527688644,2018-05-30

* there were some talks/rumors of [Bethesda may be working on a GoT game several months ago.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/08/27/target-may-have-just-leaked-the-existence-of-bethesdas-game-of-thrones-video-game/#198dfd3f3cb9) It's also known that Bethesda were approached before years ago to develop a GoT game, but turned it down to focus on Skyrim.

* Bethesda has confirmed that there will be 2 new IP announced/developed before Elder Scrolls 6. One of it is confirmed to be Starfield, so the 2nd IP is still unknown and leaves a GoT game up for speculation.

idk, I just find it kinda weird tehy'd have some GoT prop lying around at Bethesda, *unless*... :thinking:

Game of Thrones season 8 plot,"**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 1**

A Dream of Spring:

We see all the castles of the realm destroyed by the white walkers and the Night King sitting on the iron throne, It’s Bran’s vision of how Westeros would end up if they don’t win this war.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen get married in White Harbor. They claim that it is to make the northern lords accept their alliance more easily, but it really is for love. The night’s watch and the wildlings arrive to Winterfell \(they would be useless at Castle Black\) led by Tormund and Beric. They inform Sansa that the wall has fallen. Bran already knew. Jaimie is in his way to Casterly Rock when Bronn finds him and tells him that he is coming too because he doesn’t trust Cersei. Qyburn is examining the remains of the Wight when he is informed that the golden company has arrived. He tells Cersei and she commands them to go to the throne room. Cersei pays the golden company. Their commander vows to Cersei that she shall have Daenerys’s head and all her allies dead while he tells the story of the Backfire’s and how they have no love for the Targaryen’s. He swears that she shall have blood of the dragon. Euron tries to move on Cersei but she refuses him and says the war is not over yet and she is pregnant. Euron is angry, he feels betrayed by Cersei, so he decides to sail back to the iron islands. He returns to Silence and speaks with Yara about why he’s done what he’s done while he tortures her. He tells her it’s because he always was the little brother and could hold no real power and that he was frustrated by that but now he finally has real power to do things like torture people if he wants. Dany and Jon arrive at Winterfell in a very similar scene to when Robert and the Lannisters arrive there in the first episode. Some lords are reluctant to bend the knee to Daenerys, but Jon tells them what she’s done and convinces them. Sansa is also a bit frustrated but does not object as she understands that survival comes first. Then Jon goes inside with Arya, Sansa and Bran and they have their emotional reunion. Jon goes to the crypts, Dany comes with him, they speak of this war and everyone Jon has lost. Jon tells her about Ned and his brothers Robb and Rickon, he even tells her about Ygritte, Dany tells Jon about Viseryon and Khal Drogo. Finally, they speak about Rhaegar and Lyanna too. Sam is reading the books he stole, he reads the story of the 13th Lord Commander of the Night Watch and the last hero. Jon comes to see him and tells him to come to the great hall, Sam doesn’t have time to tell Jon the truth of his parentage. Jon gives orders to prepare Winterfell’s defenses. Jon and Tyrion talk, in the same place where they first met, about Jon’s and Dany’s marriage \(he thinks some lords may see him as a traitor\) and asks Jon if he loves Dany even if he already knows the answer, Jon doesn’t respond. Dany has felt some stomach ache and the master of Winterfell tells her she is pregnant. Theon arrives to the Iron islands to find them almost empty. His uncle Aeron is in Pyke. Theon takes him captive. Jaimie arrives at the rock and goes to the dungeons where he finds Edmure Tully. Jaime feeds him and lets him have a bath. Jamie promises that if the Tully army comes with him north \(Cersei controls the Lannister army\) Edmure shall have the Riverlands back and if he doesn’t they will all die. He accepts. Sansa and Tyrion reunite and speak of everything that has happened to them. Bran and Sam take Jon to the crypts, so no one hears them and finally tell him the truth. We see The Last Hearth fall.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 2**

I am The Storm.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon is confused by what Sam and Bran just told him and doesn’t know what to do with it. Jon goes to talk to Dany and tries to tell her, but she reveals that she’s pregnant and Jon can’t bring himself to do it. Arya reunites with Gendry and the Hound. Cersei commands the Golden Company to take back the south and orders Qyburn to create more wildfire and ballistae for the dragons. Qyburn informs her that the other experiment is going well. We see a montage of the Golden Company taking back the castles in the south including Dragonstone. Jaimie arrives at Winterfell with Edmure, Bronn and the Tully forces. At first, they don’t trust him, but Brienne stands up for him. Jaime gives the Starks Widows Wail to prove that he is trust worthy and he confesses that he throwed Bran out the window and asks forgiveness. Bran forgives him and tells him that if he hadn’t pushed him his third eye wouldn’t have opened. But the northern lords aren’t happy about this, one takes out a sword and menaces him but Jon orders him to stop . Jaimie informs them about Cersei’s betrayal, Tyrion is disappointed but not surprised, then Varys tells them that Cersei controls the south again. Daenerys is angry and wants to do something about it, but Tyrion and Jon tell her there is nothing she can do. Jon asks Sansa and Arya what to do with the information he has, and they tell him that the honorable thing to do is to tell everyone, but that it may not be the most intelligent thing to do. Sam is reading and finds that there was a Valyrian steel sword forged in Westeros thousands of years ago and tells Bran to go have a look. Bran sees that it is forged using dragon fire, dragon glass and steel. They ask Gendry if he could forge one and Dany if she could provide the fire. They forge the first valerian steel sword in centuries. Jaimie is checking their plans to defend Winterfell with Tyrion when Jon calls everyone to the great hall and tells the truth. Dany angry and confused doesn’t want to believe him but Bran tells her things that only she knew, and she has no other option than believe them. Some northern lords are also angry about this and leave Winterfell saying that they won’t fight together with Lannister’s and Targaryen’s. Jon says he has no interest on the iron throne, but she leaves flying with Drogon. Rhaegal stays and cries for his mother. Word reaches Winterfell that The Last Heart and Karhold have fallen. They have no other choice than prepare their defenses and hope Dany returns in time. A letter from Cersei also arrives saying that the help is coming but Jaimie doesn’t believe it and throws the letter to the fire. Euron Greyjoy arrives at the Iron Islands and finds Theon beside the seastone chair. Theon challenges him to 1v1 combat, at first Euron is reluctant but Theon convinces him asking if he is afraid. They fight in the same place where the kingsmoot took place while a huge storm starts. It’s a long fight but finally Theon wins as Euron falls to his death in the ocean, but with his last breath he orders Yara killed and so it happens. Theon can’t save her, but he takes the head of the man who killed her. With her dying breath she tells Theon he should be the king of the Iron Islands. Theon gives an epic speech and becomes the king, no longer afraid or weak.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 3**

Winterfell

The army of the dead is seen in the horizon by Jon. The signal is given for everyone to go to their places. 

\-Opening Credits\-

The army of the dead is here, and Daenerys is nowhere to be seen. They chain Rhaegal inside the walls so the night king can´t have him. The unsullied and the Dothraki will fight in the open field and the Northmen Will stay close to the walls of Winterfell and the Tully men and Nights watch will man the walls. They all have dragon glass weapons and some even Valyrian steel. The archers will use fire arrows. Grey Worm gives a goodbye kiss to Missandei fearing that he might die. A huge battle begins. There are lots of epic moments: Jaimie and Brienne fighting together, Tormund saving the hound, Arya using her skills to fight white walkers, Jon leading the fight in the field, Grey Worms death, Wight giants, Viseryon burning people, ice spiders as big as hounds… Inside the walls of Winterfell Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei, Davos and Varys are watching the battle. They see Grey Worms’ death and Sansa and Davos try to comfort Missandei. Varys says they are going to lose Tyrion asks how he knows and Varys scared answers *the flames told me, when I was cut.* Sam and Bran are in the crypts of Winterfell and they find a secret passage out of Winterfell where they could all scape if need be, but Bran senses that there is something more down there and that he needs to see it, Sam tells him that they can’t because the way is blocked, then Bran tries to use his powers to see but fails. The Army of the dead starts to win and advance, the living are losing. Most of the main characters return to the safety of Winterfell but Jon and Beric Dondarion are surrounded by Wights. The Night King comes down to kill them, it seems that he wants to do it himself. Beric faces him and hits him with a Valeryan steel sword but it shatters, then he grabs a dragon glass dagger from the floor and stabs him, but it also breaks, and the Night King kills him. Jon terrified realizes it won’t be so easy to stop him. Rhaegal frees himself comes down to help Jon. Jon escapes in the Dragon but must leave Ghost behind who also dies. In Winterfell everyone is escaping by the secret passage, there is no way to win this fight. But they realize that they won’t go far if the dead follow them, so some men must stay behind. The Night’s Watch and the Wildlings stay. Jaime decides to stay too and lead them. He says goodbye to Tyrion. Jaimie is all in black except his golden hand which he gives to Brienne, he also asks her if she could fill Jaimie’s pages on the white book. Brienne objects saying that Jaimie swore an oath to fight beside them, not to die for them and Jaime responds *then I’ll have to be an oath breaker to the end of my days.* The tunnel leads them to a hill from which you can see Winterfell in the distance. Tormund says he never imagined dying fighting side by side with crows to Dolorous Edd. He agrees. Jaime dies honorably commanding the watch ant trying to take down as many Wights and Walkers as he can. Eventually the castle falls and is burned by Viseryon, only the crypts remain. Jon arrives to the hill as they all watch Winterfell burn. Sansa is crying, and everyone is in a depressive mood as they start their way down the Kingsroad. Only a few thousand men have survived and are generally very hurt. There is no hope left, the dream of spring has died.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 4**

The Long Night

Melisandre enters the temple of r'hllor in Volantis. She speaks with Kinvara and tells her the great other has returned to bring death upon as all. She asks for a look in the great fire and reinforcements to bring to Westeros. Kinvara agrees. Melisandre looks into the great flames, she looks sad but hopeful \(we don’t know what she is seeing\) 

\-Opening Credits\-

Our heroes and what’s left of their army march south by the Kingsroad as fast as they can even if they really don’t know where to go. Men are deserting and dying every day. Everyone is giving up Jon says that they fought, and they lost but Sansa steps up and tell that no is not the time to mourn, right now they need to survive and defeat the Night King and that the only way to do it is go to Kings Landing and try to make a new alliance with Cersei. Tyrion agrees and they all decide to go to the capital. Qyburn shows Cersei all the ballistae and wildfire, and his new invention. It’s a horn that lets him control the Wight, he makes a demonstration with the remains. Word reaches them that Winterfell has fallen. Cersei smiles. Theon hears of the fall of Winterfell and decides to sail to kings landing, he thinks that if there is another battle against the dead it will be there. Jon and company find Dany and Drogon in their way south, at first, they are angry because she left but then they notice she is full of blood. Dany tells Jon she’s had a miscarriage and that she is sorry she couldn’t fight. Jon is sad and hugs her and tells it doesn’t matter and that he loves her now and always even if they both are Targaryens. Jon bends the knee before her even if he already did that to probe her that he is not interested in the throne. Along the way Bran says he must go to the isle of faces, that he must see. Sam and a little escort bring him there. Sam and Bran find children of the forest in the isle the only ones left. Bran enters a vision. He sees the last hero or azor ahai \(who is the thirteenth lord commander of the night watch, there would have been 12 commanders already during the long night but they all died and now are white walkers\) forge lightbringer plunging the sword to his wife’s hearth, he sees him kill the previous leader of the white walkers, the one created by the children of the forest. But before dying they turn his wife into a walker. The Hero doesn´t know this. He joins the watch to hunt down the remaining Others. One day beyond the wall he finds a woman with eyes as cold as ice. It’s his wife Nissa Nissa. They make love and he brings her to The Nightfort. He becomes the Night’s King slowly turning into a walker. He makes sacrifices to her, so she can create more White Walkers. Eventually the king on the north and the king beyond the wall unite forces to defeat him. He is exiled to the far north \(the king in the north was his brother so he spared his life\) and she is taken captive by the king in the north. He completes his transformation to a White Walker but is weak. With time and the cold he gets back his power \(some 8 thousand years\). Bran also sees the Night King walking through the crypts of Winterfell, he enters to the section that was blocked and starts going deeper. Finally, he finds the night’s queen, his wife but she dyes just in front of him because of the heat of Winterfell’s hot springs. He arrived late and now is full of rage and grief. At the end the villain was just the hero of the other side trying to get his wife back but now he wants revenge and to destroy this entire continent. Bran realizes that he should have seen this before and he could have prevented this war from happening just giving his wife back to him but now is too late and they are all doomed because winter is coming to get them. Bran and Sam stay in the isle because Bran says he is of more help here than in any other place because the Weirwoods augment his powers. The children of the forest start praying all around him to make him even more powerful. Jon thanks Rhaegal for saving him and bonds with him a little more, Dany tells Jon to mount him Jon does and so he is flying again but this time he has control over the dragon. Jon comes down and reflects about that the dragon is named after his father. This still confuses Jon as he doesn’t seem to know who he is. They arrive to Kings Landing \(Jon and Dany in dragon back, Cersei sees them from the map area\) and ask for an audience with Cersei. Cersei sits high above them all while they step in the throne room. Cersei is surprised that they survived and welcomes them. She is upset that Sansa and Arya al also with them and calls them wolf whores. They make a new alliance, Cersei easily cooperates, the Golden Company will fight beside them, and they’ll have all her recourses available, and tells them of the horn Qyburn has created. She tells them that earlier Theon Greyjoy and the iron born had arrived. They see the iron fleet and talk with Theon. After all the rest have left Theon thanks Jon about the council he gave him at the end of season 7 and says to Jon that he can be a Targaryen and a Stark. Jon smiles and leaves. Brienne fills Jaimie’s pages in the white book.  Tyrion and Cersei speak, she hears about Jaimie’s death, they drink some wine for him. Varys speaks with a little bird, and questions him about Cersei and Qyburn. He promises him sweets and tells him to stay hidden that if they win this war he will need his help. Everyone gathers in the room of the small council sessions and prepare their plans to defend the city. Tyrion suggests placing wildfire pots in the surroundings of the city, so they can burn the Wights when they arrive. They will place ballistae in the walls, with dragon glass tips. The ironmen will shoot them from the ships. Garrison of men will be prepared to step into the field once the wildfire has exploded. Some of them will even ride elephants. Jon and Daenerys will fight from the air with dragons. They receive a raven from Bran saying that he will stay in the isle \(yes, Sam brought birds to the isle\). Cersei has a secret meeting with the commander of the golden company and tells him once the death are defeated he wants them to turn against Jon and Dany and kill everyone in their side except her brother, he has some objections, but Cersei reminds him that his word is as good as gold and offers to pay double. He accepts. Varys’s little bird has heard this conversation and tells the eunuch. Jon and Dany have epic RED KEEP SEX \(?\).  The army of the dead kills everyone in White Harbor, The Eyrie \(They put a spear trough sweet Robin\), Riverrun, Harrenhal, Casterly Rock, Dragonstone… And they finally arrive at Kings Landing.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 5**

The Great War

\-Opening Credits showing everything destroyed and frozen\-

A huge snowstorm starts in Kings Landing as the army of the dead approaches. Everyone is at their positions. Cersei locks herself the same in the tower where she was during Blackwater, Sansa, Tyrion and other characters who aren’t involved in the fighting \(the mountain is protecting them outside\). Cersei has poison to die if need be like she did back in season 2. 

The first one to arrive is the Night King in his dragon. The great horn is placed and ready to be used. Qyburn uses the horn himself because of how proud he is of it. It makes a very loud sound and for a moment the dragon stops, but then it burns Qyburn and everyone around there with its blue flames. Jon and Dany go into their dragons, a dance of dragons starts in the sky ant the city begins to burn. The Wights are arriving, and the wildfire trap is activated. Bronn shoots the arrow as he did in blackwater. The hound looks away. The trap kills a lot of Wights and is very useful, but the walkers are coming and extinguishing the flames. Fire arrows start to rain on them from the ships and the walls. The garrison comes out from the gate. They are led by the commander of the golden company in an elephant. Arya, Davos and Gendry ride with them \(Brienne stays behind to look after Sansa\). A brutal fight starts, the biggest battle ever in game of thrones with thousands of fighters and 3 dragons. Bran wargs into Nymeria and leads her wolf pack down to the battle. There are lots of epic and tense moments... Gendry charges to a white walker with his Warhammer like Robert did in the trident against Rhaegar, the elephants charge giants and spiders, Arya uses the face of a Wight to get close to a walker and kill him, the battle field is full of flames of three different colors \(orange, blue, and green\) … Even if they fight valiantly the Wights are too many so they start winning again, Arya is trapped, Davos is against bad odds, the iron fleet is burning… and then over the horizon appear a fleet of red ships. From those ships fighters all in red wielding fiery weapons start to land ashore. They are the fiery hand. They save Davos and Arya and all the rest. Arya sees Melisandre and she nods to her. Davos goes to speak with her. She says she must speak with Jon. Davos angrily accompanies her to the city. Davos leaves her there and tells her Jon is in the dragon. Melisandre encounters Varys. She tells him to help her get to Jon. In the sky the battle between the dragons is fierce. Eventually Rhaegal dies and Jon falls. Dany is sad, but she also rapidly burns the dragons body, so it can’t be turned. The dead enter the city, even with the fiery hand is hasn’t been enough to stop them. The streets are burning and most of the fighting is happening on them. Jon is in middle of the fight trying to make his way to the ballistae and try to shoot Vyserion. Jon encounters Varys and Melisandre in the way. She tells Jon in a cryptic fashion that he needs to kill the woman he loves to forge lightbringer and bring the dawn. Jon doesn’t immediately understand her but thanks her for the information and follows his way. Cersei is having contraption, her child is about to be born, so she rushes into her chambers and asks for some servants to help her with the child. He orders the mountain to stay behind and watch that no one comes close. The Hound has had too much of the fire and returns to the keep only to find The Mountain inside. The Hound tries to tell him that right now he doesn’t want to fight but The Mountain attacks anyway, then the hound realizes that his brothers’ eyes are blue as a Wights \(The Mountain has been undead all this time, as an artificial Wight created by Qyburn, and now the White Walkers control him\). They fight in the room with the map of Westeros painted in it. The Mountain is wining and throws The Hounds Valyrian steel sword away. The Hound has no choice but to face his fears and kill his brother with fire. Bran is in using his powers to help in the fight when a white walker arrives at the isle of faces. The Wights can’t enter because of the magic, but it’s not powerful enough to kill the walker. The walker kills the guards protecting them and Sam must face him alone wielding Hearts Bane. Sam is scared but wins the duel saving Bran. In the middle of the fighting Jon tries to reach the ballistae, but in the way he encounters Ghost as a Wight. Jon fights against him but the direwolf is wining. Arya comes to the rescue and helps Jon fight him. Jon kills him with Longclaw. Arya goes back to the battle riding her direwolf Nymeria. There would be some more epic fighting. The tower where Brienne, Sansa and Podrick are starts to burn. They get out, but they are ambushed by Wights and a walker. Brienne and Pod fight side by side protecting Sansa \(and Tyrion\). Podrick dies having killed the walker. Brienne and Sansa seek refuge in a common home. Tyrion sees all the destruction and goes to the cellar to get drunk . Jon gets to the Ballistae. He shots and fails 2 times. When he is about to shoot the third time Dany uses Drogon to stop Viseryon from moving. Jon has a clear shot, but it would mean kill Drogon too. Dany tells him to do it, so Jon does it and kills both dragons. They start to fall. Drogon and Dany fall to the throne room behind the iron throne and the night king and Vyserion just outside the throne room. Jon gets to the throne room too by a side door and goes to Dany’s side. The throne room is burned and full of snow just as it was in the vision in season 2. The night king enters and is ready to fight. Jon realizes the meaning of Melisandre´s words and knows what he must do. With a tear in his eye he looks at Daenerys and stabs Longclaw right through her chest. She falls on to the iron throne and she starts dying seated on it. Longclaw bursts into flames and an epic final confrontation takes place between Jon and the Night King. A true song of ice and fire. The night king is better than Jon and Bran sees this, so he tries to enter the night kings mind. Inside his head the night king and bran have a psychic battle. It’s really tens but Bran slows him down enough for Jon to land a fatal blow. We would see all the Wights and white walkers die. Jon is wounded and bleeding, he walks to Daenerys and touches her hand and tells her hi is sorry. She smiles and dies. Jon still bleeding walks outside the room and falls to the ground. Having accomplished his purpose Jon dies for real in the steps of the red keep seeing the sun for the first time this season while the stark theme plays in the background. Melisandre also sees the sun, takes out her collar and steps into the flames \(Davos sees this in the distance while he holds the burned stag on his hand\). The last shot of the episode would be Jon dead in the same position than in the finale of season 5. The great war is over, and the dawn has finally come.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 6**

A Song of Ice and Fire

\-Opening Credits\-

The episode starts with all the wights and Walkers dying and everyone looking relieved as the sum comes out. But then the golden company start killing Cersei’s enemies \(the northern army\). Arya sees this and kills the commander of the golden company. Arya asks him why they did this, and he responds it were Cersei’s orders and that they never break their contract. Arya wears his face and orders the fight to stop. She goes see Cersei with the face. She finds Cersei bleeding and suffering on her bed. Cersei is clearly dying so Arya doesn’t kill her. Cersei asks Arya to find Tyrion and bring him. Arya finds Tyrion in the cellar very drunk and tells him the battle is over they have won and that his sister wants to see him. Tyrion arrives at Cersei’s chambers. Cersei is dying of childbirth, she’s had a dwarf son and is dying of it like their mother. Cersei laughs at the irony. She apologizes for all the horrible things she’s done to her dwarf brother and asks him to rise the child. She tells him to take The Rock and rise the child there. Cersei names the child Tywin and says *promise me Tyrion* as she dies. Tyrion takes the baby and goes to the throne room. Every main character that has survived is there. They are sad about Jon and Dany. They say some words for them and discuss what to do now. Tyrion says that they must hold a great council with all the lords and ladies that have survived. The council will be at Oldtown because it hasn’t suffered much on the wars and the maesters are there. Everyone leaves the throne room. Arya goes to a room alone and cries for Jon, the hound finds her and comforts her. Tyrion finds 3 dragon eggs beside Drogons body, but he decides to throw them in the ocean where no one can find them, Bronn asks him why he did that, Tyrion tells him the dragons have done much more harm than good. Bran and Sam also see the sun rise from the isle, Bran tells Sam there is one more thing he wants to do before leaving the island. Bran goes into a vision and sees the black cells with Eddard lying there, Bran speaks with his father and thanks to the additional power he has in the island Ned can see him. Ned asks if everything is well. Bran doubts a moment and the answer*s y*es, Ned nods and says that then he has nothing to worry about. The guards come to take him. Sometime later everyone is in Oldtown for the great council. All the lords, great and small are there. The maesters inform that it will start in an hour. Everyone is meeting each other when Tyrion asks to speak with Varys privately, only Bronn comes with them.  Tyrion offers Varys wine and he refuses, but Tyrion tells him to drink. Varys reluctantly does so. Tyrion asks Varys why and revels he knows the spiders plan to kill everyone in the meeting. Tyrion spoke with the little birds in King’s Landing. He is sad and disappointed. Varys tells Tyrion that the flames told him that when the long night comes if the right king or queen doesn’t sit the Iron Throne they would all be doomed \(with more poetic words\). He tells Tyrion about all his failed attempts at that. He says he really does care about the people of the realm and so tough the best monarch would be same one who did the best for them. With all his failed attempts he started to grow frustrated and started wondering how it would feel to sit in that throne. He never had the chance to try to climb those steps until now. Tyrion asks is he would also have killed him. Varys says it was nothing personal. Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Varys and he does it. The meeting starts, and all the lords start discussing who the next king should be, who has the best claim. The discussion grows really tense until Tyrion says he trusted Daenerys because she was the queen he chose. Tyrion suggest that a council may be hold every 5 years to elect the new king or queen. Every lord great and small might have a vote and anyone has a chance to be king. The only thing they would need to do is step up and tell what their plans for the realm are. A great king could rule all his life wile a mad one would only last 5 years. They also would set some laws that even the king must obey. They decide the first king election will be hold in 5 years, until then the maesters will have the regency while the lords focus on rebuilding and repopulating.  Then they discuss the situation of the north and the iron islands. They are offered the chance to be independent kingdoms but Sansa refuses because she sees that thing will be done better now in Westeros. Theon does the same following Sansa’s example. They are granted the honorary titles of queen in the North and king of the Iron Islands to preserve peace in the future. The empty castles are given to new and old lords. Gendry is legitimized and given Storm’s End, Bronn is given the twins, Edmure is given Riverrun back, Sam Hornhill, Tyrion the rock… Bran says that the night’s watch must be reformed in the case that the death come back again. Jorah Mormont offers to rebuild the watch and become the 1000th lord commander. Tyrion says that the iron thrones must be destroyed, and a more comfortable throne must be built to replace it. The great council ends. Daenerys and the iron throne are burnt together while Jon is being burned in the north \(in the ruins of Winterfell\) like the men of the watch and the wildlings did. Tyrion and Bronn are in their way to their castles. Tyrion gives Bronn a really big sack of gold and tells him he will change the wealth of house Lannister from gold to wine. Everyone arrives at their seats. The hound becomes a monk with a vow of silence finally finding peace. Davos will return to the sea. He will bring Missandei to her homeland of Naath. Up at the wall the Stark sisters say goodbye to Bran who must go beyond\-the\-wall to watch the death as the new 3 eyed raven. He says that maybe the dead never return but that he must go and watch. Jorah says that if Westeros is changing the watch must change too. From no on you won’t take the black for life but you will serve some years and at the end of your time you shall be recompensed. The Starks sisters and Brienne walk through the ruined Winterfell that is being rebuilt. Brienne wants to be Sansa’s first Queenguard, to which she responds that she is no true queen. Brienne answers that she is no true knight, Sansa smiles and makes Brienne her queenguard. Sansa asks Arya what she will do now, she suggests that she could give her, a castle. Arya says no, that is not her. She asks Sansa what is west of Westeros and tells her she will find out but promises to return some day. Before she leaves Sansa has a final thing to show her. They go down to the crypts, the only part left intact. Sansa had ordered a statue of the whole Stark family made. Everyone is there: Ned, Catelyn, Robb, Rickon, Bran, Sansa, Arya and even Jon. Cut to black.

Some years later we are at Hornhill. In the yards there is a singer singing a song about Jon and Dany defeating the night king. Gilly and little Sam are in the yard dancing happily. Sam looks down from a window and smiles. Then he finishes his book about The Great War and we see that he names it *A Song Of Ice And Fire*.",gameofthrones,True,1527707665,2018-05-30
[SPOILERS] My Predictions for Bran &amp; Sansa in Season 8,"Okay so this is my continuation of my predictions for each of the characters arcs for next season, Now before I start two things 1. I have done one for Arya already and i'll link it if you want to go check it out 
https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8ldn5g/spoilers_my_predictions_for_arya_stark/

Secondly I know some people were not huge fans of the Arya predictions and NO my predictions for Arya is to not try and redeem her because she is my Fav character. I do think she will go to some dark places next season but I don't think it will go too far. Plus there MY predictions not everything needs to be perfect. I only say because I do not plan on changing my predictions anytime soon.

Now let's begin, I'll start with Sansa since my predictions for her are pretty straight forward. With the Death of LF Sansa has finally FINALLY come into her own and is no longer a pawn in someone else's game, I also think this is a chance for the Showrunners to make up for last season by seeing the Stark sisters bound alittle more maybe Sansa even apologizes to Arya for being a pain to her in childhood. With that all said she will have a problem with Jon bending the knee to the Daughter of the Mad king and I think she will question Jon on his actions especially when Jon brings up getting help from Cersei, However Bran will show Arya and Sansa all the good things she did for the Slaves in Essos and see Dany is not that bad and of course she'll grow to like her more.

I also think Sansa will have a reunion with Tyrion and the Hound now weather or not she romantically bonds with one of them is another story (even though I kindof hope not, Especially since there both older then she is). Anyways when the big battle for the Dawn (the first battle anyways) comes around Sansa will be at WF helping everyone evacuate however when Euron, Strickland, and the GC attack she along with Varys and Tyrion get captured and taken to KL. When she is brought to the throne hall for her to be shown to Cersei we get a parallel moment to S2 when Joffrey has on her knees and is about to kill her, except this time around A. It's Cersei instead of Joffrey (obviously) and B. Sansa actually stands up to her and does not kneel but stands tall (also she is not crying).

Anyways afterwards she throws Tyrion and Sansa into the black cells while Varys is thrown into a different cell, Tyrion admits that he made a deal with Cersei and we pretty much finally learn what the cut scene from S7 was between Tyrion and Cersei (though i'll get into that when I do Tyrion) anyways Sansa gives him a motivational speech and Tyrion and Sansa hug. Anyways later Varys is said to be turned up missing and much later Arya comes in and saves her and Tyrion, they hug it out and explain everything that has happened. Sansa is given the North and made Queen of the North.

Okay now for Bran, So Bran one of my Fav characters (which would be shocking because you may think it's Arya but actually no it's Bran...Arya is my second Fav) though that may change alittle due to his behavior last season, but personally I think that is one of the side effects of not only having so much knowledge but also being away 3ER tree for too long and I think that will be explain in S8. Also I think Jaime and Theon will come and apologise to Bran for there actions against him. Bran will forgive both of them as that does not matter anymore (also I would like it if HR showed up but sadly I don't think he will at this point, even though he should).

Bran along with Sam will also tell Jon of his true parentage and then along with Sam and possibly Gilly and Little Sam will leave to the God's Eye prior to the Battle. Once there Bran will get all the knowledge he can about how to defeat the WW's and what they want, why did they return, and what does AA/TPTWP have to do with any of this including a flashback with Rhaegar (either Tourney at Harrenhal, Battle of the Trident, or something completely different we are not expecting). Anyways Jon I think will go to him to the God's Eye where Bran will reveal not only is he Lightbringer as Rhaegar was AA/TPTWP but also the WW's have returned due a combination of a Resurgence in Magic, Jon's birth, Them wanting to end the curse the children put on them, and them being threatened by the TLOL. 

Bran also informs Jon he must embrace his Targ side, He wargs into Rhaegal bringing him to the God's Eye as Jon gets on Rhaegal. In the end they deal with the NK and Bran leaves Beyond the Wall possibly with some now turned human WW's. ",gameofthrones,True,1527708481,2018-05-30

[LEAKS] Game Of Thrones Season 8 Plot,"**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 1**

A Dream of Spring:

We see all the castles of the realm destroyed by the white walkers and the Night King sitting on the iron throne, It’s Bran’s vision of how Westeros would end up if they don’t win this war.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen get married in White Harbor. They claim that it is to make the northern lords accept their alliance more easily, but it really is for love. The night’s watch and the wildlings arrive to Winterfell \(they would be useless at Castle Black\) led by Tormund and Beric. They inform Sansa that the wall has fallen. Bran already knew. Jaimie is in his way to Casterly Rock when Bronn finds him and tells him that he is coming too because he doesn’t trust Cersei. Qyburn is examining the remains of the Wight when he is informed that the golden company has arrived. He tells Cersei and she commands them to go to the throne room. Cersei pays the golden company. Their commander vows to Cersei that she shall have Daenerys’s head and all her allies dead while he tells the story of the Backfire’s and how they have no love for the Targaryen’s. He swears that she shall have blood of the dragon. Euron tries to move on Cersei but she refuses him and says the war is not over yet and she is pregnant. Euron is angry, he feels betrayed by Cersei, so he decides to sail back to the iron islands. He returns to Silence and speaks with Yara about why he’s done what he’s done while he tortures her. He tells her it’s because he always was the little brother and could hold no real power and that he was frustrated by that but now he finally has real power to do things like torture people if he wants. Dany and Jon arrive at Winterfell in a very similar scene to when Robert and the Lannisters arrive there in the first episode. Some lords are reluctant to bend the knee to Daenerys, but Jon tells them what she’s done and convinces them. Sansa is also a bit frustrated but does not object as she understands that survival comes first. Then Jon goes inside with Arya, Sansa and Bran and they have their emotional reunion. Jon goes to the crypts, Dany comes with him, they speak of this war and everyone Jon has lost. Jon tells her about Ned and his brothers Robb and Rickon, he even tells her about Ygritte, Dany tells Jon about Viseryon and Khal Drogo. Finally, they speak about Rhaegar and Lyanna too. Sam is reading the books he stole, he reads the story of the 13th Lord Commander of the Night Watch and the last hero. Jon comes to see him and tells him to come to the great hall, Sam doesn’t have time to tell Jon the truth of his parentage. Jon gives orders to prepare Winterfell’s defenses. Jon and Tyrion talk, in the same place where they first met, about Jon’s and Dany’s marriage \(he thinks some lords may see him as a traitor\) and asks Jon if he loves Dany even if he already knows the answer, Jon doesn’t respond. Dany has felt some stomach ache and the master of Winterfell tells her she is pregnant. Theon arrives to the Iron islands to find them almost empty. His uncle Aeron is in Pyke. Theon takes him captive. Jaimie arrives at the rock and goes to the dungeons where he finds Edmure Tully. Jaime feeds him and lets him have a bath. Jamie promises that if the Tully army comes with him north \(Cersei controls the Lannister army\) Edmure shall have the Riverlands back and if he doesn’t they will all die. He accepts. Sansa and Tyrion reunite and speak of everything that has happened to them. Bran and Sam take Jon to the crypts, so no one hears them and finally tell him the truth. We see The Last Hearth fall.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 2**

I am The Storm.

\-Opening Credits\-

Jon is confused by what Sam and Bran just told him and doesn’t know what to do with it. Jon goes to talk to Dany and tries to tell her, but she reveals that she’s pregnant and Jon can’t bring himself to do it. Arya reunites with Gendry and the Hound. Cersei commands the Golden Company to take back the south and orders Qyburn to create more wildfire and ballistae for the dragons. Qyburn informs her that the other experiment is going well. We see a montage of the Golden Company taking back the castles in the south including Dragonstone. Jaimie arrives at Winterfell with Edmure, Bronn and the Tully forces. At first, they don’t trust him, but Brienne stands up for him. Jaime gives the Starks Widows Wail to prove that he is trust worthy and he confesses that he throwed Bran out the window and asks forgiveness. Bran forgives him and tells him that if he hadn’t pushed him his third eye wouldn’t have opened. But the northern lords aren’t happy about this, one takes out a sword and menaces him but Jon orders him to stop . Jaimie informs them about Cersei’s betrayal, Tyrion is disappointed but not surprised, then Varys tells them that Cersei controls the south again. Daenerys is angry and wants to do something about it, but Tyrion and Jon tell her there is nothing she can do. Jon asks Sansa and Arya what to do with the information he has, and they tell him that the honorable thing to do is to tell everyone, but that it may not be the most intelligent thing to do. Sam is reading and finds that there was a Valyrian steel sword forged in Westeros thousands of years ago and tells Bran to go have a look. Bran sees that it is forged using dragon fire, dragon glass and steel. They ask Gendry if he could forge one and Dany if she could provide the fire. They forge the first valerian steel sword in centuries. Jaimie is checking their plans to defend Winterfell with Tyrion when Jon calls everyone to the great hall and tells the truth. Dany angry and confused doesn’t want to believe him but Bran tells her things that only she knew, and she has no other option than believe them. Some northern lords are also angry about this and leave Winterfell saying that they won’t fight together with Lannister’s and Targaryen’s. Jon says he has no interest on the iron throne, but she leaves flying with Drogon. Rhaegal stays and cries for his mother. Word reaches Winterfell that The Last Heart and Karhold have fallen. They have no other choice than prepare their defenses and hope Dany returns in time. A letter from Cersei also arrives saying that the help is coming but Jaimie doesn’t believe it and throws the letter to the fire. Euron Greyjoy arrives at the Iron Islands and finds Theon beside the seastone chair. Theon challenges him to 1v1 combat, at first Euron is reluctant but Theon convinces him asking if he is afraid. They fight in the same place where the kingsmoot took place while a huge storm starts. It’s a long fight but finally Theon wins as Euron falls to his death in the ocean, but with his last breath he orders Yara killed and so it happens. Theon can’t save her, but he takes the head of the man who killed her. With her dying breath she tells Theon he should be the king of the Iron Islands. Theon gives an epic speech and becomes the king, no longer afraid or weak.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 3**

Winterfell

The army of the dead is seen in the horizon by Jon. The signal is given for everyone to go to their places. 

\-Opening Credits\-

The army of the dead is here, and Daenerys is nowhere to be seen. They chain Rhaegal inside the walls so the night king can´t have him. The unsullied and the Dothraki will fight in the open field and the Northmen Will stay close to the walls of Winterfell and the Tully men and Nights watch will man the walls. They all have dragon glass weapons and some even Valyrian steel. The archers will use fire arrows. Grey Worm gives a goodbye kiss to Missandei fearing that he might die. A huge battle begins. There are lots of epic moments: Jaimie and Brienne fighting together, Tormund saving the hound, Arya using her skills to fight white walkers, Jon leading the fight in the field, Grey Worms death, Wight giants, Viseryon burning people, ice spiders as big as hounds… Inside the walls of Winterfell Sansa, Tyrion, Missandei, Davos and Varys are watching the battle. They see Grey Worms’ death and Sansa and Davos try to comfort Missandei. Varys says they are going to lose Tyrion asks how he knows and Varys scared answers *the flames told me, when I was cut.* Sam and Bran are in the crypts of Winterfell and they find a secret passage out of Winterfell where they could all scape if need be, but Bran senses that there is something more down there and that he needs to see it, Sam tells him that they can’t because the way is blocked, then Bran tries to use his powers to see but fails. The Army of the dead starts to win and advance, the living are losing. Most of the main characters return to the safety of Winterfell but Jon and Beric Dondarion are surrounded by Wights. The Night King comes down to kill them, it seems that he wants to do it himself. Beric faces him and hits him with a Valeryan steel sword but it shatters, then he grabs a dragon glass dagger from the floor and stabs him, but it also breaks, and the Night King kills him. Jon terrified realizes it won’t be so easy to stop him. Rhaegal frees himself comes down to help Jon. Jon escapes in the Dragon but must leave Ghost behind who also dies. In Winterfell everyone is escaping by the secret passage, there is no way to win this fight. But they realize that they won’t go far if the dead follow them, so some men must stay behind. The Night’s Watch and the Wildlings stay. Jaime decides to stay too and lead them. He says goodbye to Tyrion. Jaimie is all in black except his golden hand which he gives to Brienne, he also asks her if she could fill Jaimie’s pages on the white book. Brienne objects saying that Jaimie swore an oath to fight beside them, not to die for them and Jaime responds *then I’ll have to be an oath breaker to the end of my days.* The tunnel leads them to a hill from which you can see Winterfell in the distance. Tormund says he never imagined dying fighting side by side with crows to Dolorous Edd. He agrees. Jaime dies honorably commanding the watch ant trying to take down as many Wights and Walkers as he can. Eventually the castle falls and is burned by Viseryon, only the crypts remain. Jon arrives to the hill as they all watch Winterfell burn. Sansa is crying, and everyone is in a depressive mood as they start their way down the Kingsroad. Only a few thousand men have survived and are generally very hurt. There is no hope left, the dream of spring has died.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 4**

The Long Night

Melisandre enters the temple of r'hllor in Volantis. She speaks with Kinvara and tells her the great other has returned to bring death upon as all. She asks for a look in the great fire and reinforcements to bring to Westeros. Kinvara agrees. Melisandre looks into the great flames, she looks sad but hopeful \(we don’t know what she is seeing\) 

\-Opening Credits\-

Our heroes and what’s left of their army march south by the Kingsroad as fast as they can even if they really don’t know where to go. Men are deserting and dying every day. Everyone is giving up Jon says that they fought, and they lost but Sansa steps up and tell that no is not the time to mourn, right now they need to survive and defeat the Night King and that the only way to do it is go to Kings Landing and try to make a new alliance with Cersei. Tyrion agrees and they all decide to go to the capital. Qyburn shows Cersei all the ballistae and wildfire, and his new invention. It’s a horn that lets him control the Wight, he makes a demonstration with the remains. Word reaches them that Winterfell has fallen. Cersei smiles. Theon hears of the fall of Winterfell and decides to sail to kings landing, he thinks that if there is another battle against the dead it will be there. Jon and company find Dany and Drogon in their way south, at first, they are angry because she left but then they notice she is full of blood. Dany tells Jon she’s had a miscarriage and that she is sorry she couldn’t fight. Jon is sad and hugs her and tells it doesn’t matter and that he loves her now and always even if they both are Targaryens. Jon bends the knee before her even if he already did that to probe her that he is not interested in the throne. Along the way Bran says he must go to the isle of faces, that he must see. Sam and a little escort bring him there. Sam and Bran find children of the forest in the isle the only ones left. Bran enters a vision. He sees the last hero or azor ahai \(who is the thirteenth lord commander of the night watch, there would have been 12 commanders already during the long night but they all died and now are white walkers\) forge lightbringer plunging the sword to his wife’s hearth, he sees him kill the previous leader of the white walkers, the one created by the children of the forest. But before dying they turn his wife into a walker. The Hero doesn´t know this. He joins the watch to hunt down the remaining Others. One day beyond the wall he finds a woman with eyes as cold as ice. It’s his wife Nissa Nissa. They make love and he brings her to The Nightfort. He becomes the Night’s King slowly turning into a walker. He makes sacrifices to her, so she can create more White Walkers. Eventually the king on the north and the king beyond the wall unite forces to defeat him. He is exiled to the far north \(the king in the north was his brother so he spared his life\) and she is taken captive by the king in the north. He completes his transformation to a White Walker but is weak. With time and the cold he gets back his power \(some 8 thousand years\). Bran also sees the Night King walking through the crypts of Winterfell, he enters to the section that was blocked and starts going deeper. Finally, he finds the night’s queen, his wife but she dyes just in front of him because of the heat of Winterfell’s hot springs. He arrived late and now is full of rage and grief. At the end the villain was just the hero of the other side trying to get his wife back but now he wants revenge and to destroy this entire continent. Bran realizes that he should have seen this before and he could have prevented this war from happening just giving his wife back to him but now is too late and they are all doomed because winter is coming to get them. Bran and Sam stay in the isle because Bran says he is of more help here than in any other place because the Weirwoods augment his powers. The children of the forest start praying all around him to make him even more powerful. Jon thanks Rhaegal for saving him and bonds with him a little more, Dany tells Jon to mount him Jon does and so he is flying again but this time he has control over the dragon. Jon comes down and reflects about that the dragon is named after his father. This still confuses Jon as he doesn’t seem to know who he is. They arrive to Kings Landing \(Jon and Dany in dragon back, Cersei sees them from the map area\) and ask for an audience with Cersei. Cersei sits high above them all while they step in the throne room. Cersei is surprised that they survived and welcomes them. She is upset that Sansa and Arya al also with them and calls them wolf whores. They make a new alliance, Cersei easily cooperates, the Golden Company will fight beside them, and they’ll have all her recourses available, and tells them of the horn Qyburn has created. She tells them that earlier Theon Greyjoy and the iron born had arrived. They see the iron fleet and talk with Theon. After all the rest have left Theon thanks Jon about the council he gave him at the end of season 7 and says to Jon that he can be a Targaryen and a Stark. Jon smiles and leaves. Brienne fills Jaimie’s pages in the white book.  Tyrion and Cersei speak, she hears about Jaimie’s death, they drink some wine for him. Varys speaks with a little bird, and questions him about Cersei and Qyburn. He promises him sweets and tells him to stay hidden that if they win this war he will need his help. Everyone gathers in the room of the small council sessions and prepare their plans to defend the city. Tyrion suggests placing wildfire pots in the surroundings of the city, so they can burn the Wights when they arrive. They will place ballistae in the walls, with dragon glass tips. The ironmen will shoot them from the ships. Garrison of men will be prepared to step into the field once the wildfire has exploded. Some of them will even ride elephants. Jon and Daenerys will fight from the air with dragons. They receive a raven from Bran saying that he will stay in the isle \(yes, Sam brought birds to the isle\). Cersei has a secret meeting with the commander of the golden company and tells him once the death are defeated he wants them to turn against Jon and Dany and kill everyone in their side except her brother, he has some objections, but Cersei reminds him that his word is as good as gold and offers to pay double. He accepts. Varys’s little bird has heard this conversation and tells the eunuch. Jon and Dany have epic RED KEEP SEX \(?\).  The army of the dead kills everyone in White Harbor, The Eyrie \(They put a spear trough sweet Robin\), Riverrun, Harrenhal, Casterly Rock, Dragonstone… And they finally arrive at Kings Landing.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 5**

The Great War

\-Opening Credits showing everything destroyed and frozen\-

A huge snowstorm starts in Kings Landing as the army of the dead approaches. Everyone is at their positions. Cersei locks herself the same in the tower where she was during Blackwater, Sansa, Tyrion and other characters who aren’t involved in the fighting \(the mountain is protecting them outside\). Cersei has poison to die if need be like she did back in season 2. 

The first one to arrive is the Night King in his dragon. The great horn is placed and ready to be used. Qyburn uses the horn himself because of how proud he is of it. It makes a very loud sound and for a moment the dragon stops, but then it burns Qyburn and everyone around there with its blue flames. Jon and Dany go into their dragons, a dance of dragons starts in the sky ant the city begins to burn. The Wights are arriving, and the wildfire trap is activated. Bronn shoots the arrow as he did in blackwater. The hound looks away. The trap kills a lot of Wights and is very useful, but the walkers are coming and extinguishing the flames. Fire arrows start to rain on them from the ships and the walls. The garrison comes out from the gate. They are led by the commander of the golden company in an elephant. Arya, Davos and Gendry ride with them \(Brienne stays behind to look after Sansa\). A brutal fight starts, the biggest battle ever in game of thrones with thousands of fighters and 3 dragons. Bran wargs into Nymeria and leads her wolf pack down to the battle. There are lots of epic and tense moments... Gendry charges to a white walker with his Warhammer like Robert did in the trident against Rhaegar, the elephants charge giants and spiders, Arya uses the face of a Wight to get close to a walker and kill him, the battle field is full of flames of three different colors \(orange, blue, and green\) … Even if they fight valiantly the Wights are too many so they start winning again, Arya is trapped, Davos is against bad odds, the iron fleet is burning… and then over the horizon appear a fleet of red ships. From those ships fighters all in red wielding fiery weapons start to land ashore. They are the fiery hand. They save Davos and Arya and all the rest. Arya sees Melisandre and she nods to her. Davos goes to speak with her. She says she must speak with Jon. Davos angrily accompanies her to the city. Davos leaves her there and tells her Jon is in the dragon. Melisandre encounters Varys. She tells him to help her get to Jon. In the sky the battle between the dragons is fierce. Eventually Rhaegal dies and Jon falls. Dany is sad, but she also rapidly burns the dragons body, so it can’t be turned. The dead enter the city, even with the fiery hand is hasn’t been enough to stop them. The streets are burning and most of the fighting is happening on them. Jon is in middle of the fight trying to make his way to the ballistae and try to shoot Vyserion. Jon encounters Varys and Melisandre in the way. She tells Jon in a cryptic fashion that he needs to kill the woman he loves to forge lightbringer and bring the dawn. Jon doesn’t immediately understand her but thanks her for the information and follows his way. Cersei is having contraption, her child is about to be born, so she rushes into her chambers and asks for some servants to help her with the child. He orders the mountain to stay behind and watch that no one comes close. The Hound has had too much of the fire and returns to the keep only to find The Mountain inside. The Hound tries to tell him that right now he doesn’t want to fight but The Mountain attacks anyway, then the hound realizes that his brothers’ eyes are blue as a Wights \(The Mountain has been undead all this time, as an artificial Wight created by Qyburn, and now the White Walkers control him\). They fight in the room with the map of Westeros painted in it. The Mountain is wining and throws The Hounds Valyrian steel sword away. The Hound has no choice but to face his fears and kill his brother with fire. Bran is in using his powers to help in the fight when a white walker arrives at the isle of faces. The Wights can’t enter because of the magic, but it’s not powerful enough to kill the walker. The walker kills the guards protecting them and Sam must face him alone wielding Hearts Bane. Sam is scared but wins the duel saving Bran. In the middle of the fighting Jon tries to reach the ballistae, but in the way he encounters Ghost as a Wight. Jon fights against him but the direwolf is wining. Arya comes to the rescue and helps Jon fight him. Jon kills him with Longclaw. Arya goes back to the battle riding her direwolf Nymeria. There would be some more epic fighting. The tower where Brienne, Sansa and Podrick are starts to burn. They get out, but they are ambushed by Wights and a walker. Brienne and Pod fight side by side protecting Sansa \(and Tyrion\). Podrick dies having killed the walker. Brienne and Sansa seek refuge in a common home. Tyrion sees all the destruction and goes to the cellar to get drunk . Jon gets to the Ballistae. He shots and fails 2 times. When he is about to shoot the third time Dany uses Drogon to stop Viseryon from moving. Jon has a clear shot, but it would mean kill Drogon too. Dany tells him to do it, so Jon does it and kills both dragons. They start to fall. Drogon and Dany fall to the throne room behind the iron throne and the night king and Vyserion just outside the throne room. Jon gets to the throne room too by a side door and goes to Dany’s side. The throne room is burned and full of snow just as it was in the vision in season 2. The night king enters and is ready to fight. Jon realizes the meaning of Melisandre´s words and knows what he must do. With a tear in his eye he looks at Daenerys and stabs Longclaw right through her chest. She falls on to the iron throne and she starts dying seated on it. Longclaw bursts into flames and an epic final confrontation takes place between Jon and the Night King. A true song of ice and fire. The night king is better than Jon and Bran sees this, so he tries to enter the night kings mind. Inside his head the night king and bran have a psychic battle. It’s really tens but Bran slows him down enough for Jon to land a fatal blow. We would see all the Wights and white walkers die. Jon is wounded and bleeding, he walks to Daenerys and touches her hand and tells her hi is sorry. She smiles and dies. Jon still bleeding walks outside the room and falls to the ground. Having accomplished his purpose Jon dies for real in the steps of the red keep seeing the sun for the first time this season while the stark theme plays in the background. Melisandre also sees the sun, takes out her collar and steps into the flames \(Davos sees this in the distance while he holds the burned stag on his hand\). The last shot of the episode would be Jon dead in the same position than in the finale of season 5. The great war is over, and the dawn has finally come.

**SEASON 8 – EPISODE 6**

A Song of Ice and Fire

\-Opening Credits\-

The episode starts with all the wights and Walkers dying and everyone looking relieved as the sum comes out. But then the golden company start killing Cersei’s enemies \(the northern army\). Arya sees this and kills the commander of the golden company. Arya asks him why they did this, and he responds it were Cersei’s orders and that they never break their contract. Arya wears his face and orders the fight to stop. She goes see Cersei with the face. She finds Cersei bleeding and suffering on her bed. Cersei is clearly dying so Arya doesn’t kill her. Cersei asks Arya to find Tyrion and bring him. Arya finds Tyrion in the cellar very drunk and tells him the battle is over they have won and that his sister wants to see him. Tyrion arrives at Cersei’s chambers. Cersei is dying of childbirth, she’s had a dwarf son and is dying of it like their mother. Cersei laughs at the irony. She apologizes for all the horrible things she’s done to her dwarf brother and asks him to rise the child. She tells him to take The Rock and rise the child there. Cersei names the child Tywin and says *promise me Tyrion* as she dies. Tyrion takes the baby and goes to the throne room. Every main character that has survived is there. They are sad about Jon and Dany. They say some words for them and discuss what to do now. Tyrion says that they must hold a great council with all the lords and ladies that have survived. The council will be at Oldtown because it hasn’t suffered much on the wars and the maesters are there. Everyone leaves the throne room. Arya goes to a room alone and cries for Jon, the hound finds her and comforts her. Tyrion finds 3 dragon eggs beside Drogons body, but he decides to throw them in the ocean where no one can find them, Bronn asks him why he did that, Tyrion tells him the dragons have done much more harm than good. Bran and Sam also see the sun rise from the isle, Bran tells Sam there is one more thing he wants to do before leaving the island. Bran goes into a vision and sees the black cells with Eddard lying there, Bran speaks with his father and thanks to the additional power he has in the island Ned can see him. Ned asks if everything is well. Bran doubts a moment and the answer*s y*es, Ned nods and says that then he has nothing to worry about. The guards come to take him. Sometime later everyone is in Oldtown for the great council. All the lords, great and small are there. The maesters inform that it will start in an hour. Everyone is meeting each other when Tyrion asks to speak with Varys privately, only Bronn comes with them.  Tyrion offers Varys wine and he refuses, but Tyrion tells him to drink. Varys reluctantly does so. Tyrion asks Varys why and revels he knows the spiders plan to kill everyone in the meeting. Tyrion spoke with the little birds in King’s Landing. He is sad and disappointed. Varys tells Tyrion that the flames told him that when the long night comes if the right king or queen doesn’t sit the Iron Throne they would all be doomed \(with more poetic words\). He tells Tyrion about all his failed attempts at that. He says he really does care about the people of the realm and so tough the best monarch would be same one who did the best for them. With all his failed attempts he started to grow frustrated and started wondering how it would feel to sit in that throne. He never had the chance to try to climb those steps until now. Tyrion asks is he would also have killed him. Varys says it was nothing personal. Tyrion orders Bronn to kill Varys and he does it. The meeting starts, and all the lords start discussing who the next king should be, who has the best claim. The discussion grows really tense until Tyrion says he trusted Daenerys because she was the queen he chose. Tyrion suggest that a council may be hold every 5 years to elect the new king or queen. Every lord great and small might have a vote and anyone has a chance to be king. The only thing they would need to do is step up and tell what their plans for the realm are. A great king could rule all his life wile a mad one would only last 5 years. They also would set some laws that even the king must obey. They decide the first king election will be hold in 5 years, until then the maesters will have the regency while the lords focus on rebuilding and repopulating.  Then they discuss the situation of the north and the iron islands. They are offered the chance to be independent kingdoms but Sansa refuses because she sees that thing will be done better now in Westeros. Theon does the same following Sansa’s example. They are granted the honorary titles of queen in the North and king of the Iron Islands to preserve peace in the future. The empty castles are given to new and old lords. Gendry is legitimized and given Storm’s End, Bronn is given the twins, Edmure is given Riverrun back, Sam Hornhill, Tyrion the rock… Bran says that the night’s watch must be reformed in the case that the death come back again. Jorah Mormont offers to rebuild the watch and become the 1000th lord commander. Tyrion says that the iron thrones must be destroyed, and a more comfortable throne must be built to replace it. The great council ends. Daenerys and the iron throne are burnt together while Jon is being burned in the north \(in the ruins of Winterfell\) like the men of the watch and the wildlings did. Tyrion and Bronn are in their way to their castles. Tyrion gives Bronn a really big sack of gold and tells him he will change the wealth of house Lannister from gold to wine. Everyone arrives at their seats. The hound becomes a monk with a vow of silence finally finding peace. Davos will return to the sea. He will bring Missandei to her homeland of Naath. Up at the wall the Stark sisters say goodbye to Bran who must go beyond\-the\-wall to watch the death as the new 3 eyed raven. He says that maybe the dead never return but that he must go and watch. Jorah says that if Westeros is changing the watch must change too. From no on you won’t take the black for life but you will serve some years and at the end of your time you shall be recompensed. The Starks sisters and Brienne walk through the ruined Winterfell that is being rebuilt. Brienne wants to be Sansa’s first Queenguard, to which she responds that she is no true queen. Brienne answers that she is no true knight, Sansa smiles and makes Brienne her queenguard. Sansa asks Arya what she will do now, she suggests that she could give her, a castle. Arya says no, that is not her. She asks Sansa what is west of Westeros and tells her she will find out but promises to return some day. Before she leaves Sansa has a final thing to show her. They go down to the crypts, the only part left intact. Sansa had ordered a statue of the whole Stark family made. Everyone is there: Ned, Catelyn, Robb, Rickon, Bran, Sansa, Arya and even Jon. Cut to black.

Some years later we are at Hornhill. In the yards there is a singer singing a song about Jon and Dany defeating the night king. Gilly and little Sam are in the yard dancing happily. Sam looks down from a window and smiles. Then he finishes his book about The Great War and we see that he names it *A Song Of Ice And Fire*.",gameofthrones,True,1527709403,2018-05-30
(SPOILERS) How could Bran built the wall and made Willys Hodor??,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1526147667,2018-05-12
"[SPOILERS] How could Bran change the past with that Hodor thing? And also, why fans call him ""The Builder"" ?","A lot people say that Bran built the wall and he is the one who made willys into hodor. But that makes no sense to me. How could he change something that is already written? Wall was already built, how could he build it again by going back in time and build it?? And that Hodor thing... When the future Bran is the one that made Hodor incapable of talking anything except Hold The Door (Hodor), does it mean that in the world, where was future Bran, Hodor was normally grown man named Willys and could talk?? Please explain, thanks

I've watched shows about time changing like Steins:Gate and I could understand it, but this is too confusing to me.

And also, where did people take all these information? In Series I could see only the Hodor things, but not him building the wall or whispering something to Mad King.",gameofthrones,True,1526149052,2018-05-12

[SPOILERS] why the direwolves matter,"What is the significance of the dire wolves that each of Ned stark’s children adopted in the first season? Looks like they either forebode the fates of their Stark masters or share their fates. Ned stark drove a knife into the heart of Sansa’s dire wolf Lady. Ever since then Sansa’s heart has been broken, by Joffrey, the Tyrells, Littlefinger and Ramsay. Jon Snow has arguably done the same by bending the knee to Danaerys and handing over allegiance of Winterfell, after Sansa won it from the Boltons. Nymeria was pushed away into exile, followed soon by Arya, and both returned as different people. Grey wind helped Robb win many battles and was killed with him at the red wedding. Shaggydog and Rikon faded out into irrelevance. Summer helped Bran explore his warging abilities and died in the cave defending him, Meera Reed thinks Bran Stark also died there when the three eyed raven emerged. Ghost brought the first evidence of the wights to the Night’s Watch, as did Jon Snow to Danaerys and Cersei. Beyond that, what will be the fates of Ghost and Jon Snow?",gameofthrones,True,1526223779,2018-05-13
[SPOILERS]It will be the biggest Fire Westeros has ever seen...,"Said by Mance... But was it really?
&gt;Yes it was big. But not that big enough or impactful as meant by Mance(according to me... ignore me if I am wrong)

&gt;I thought Mance meant something more by saying the 'biggest 🔥 fire'
&gt;Clearly as the wall is 700 feet high..the fire was not visible to those attacking from south of the Wall. However warged help them to get Signal.
&gt;I thought Mance will fire The Wall or something similar which the watchers on the wall have to give tough fight.

&gt;So according to you all what more writers, GRRM or D&amp;D would have done which can spread the word of fire to all Westeros?

&gt;Also other question comes to my mind that Stannis attacked with his troops of4-5 thousands on Wildlings..but Wildlings army was around 100 thousand. Yes Mance didn't want to let his people die but still he could have win. Also Stannis attacked with planning but still Mance had numbers. So what was going in the mind of writers or D&amp;D?",gameofthrones,True,1526225786,2018-05-13
[SPOILERS] What if bran influenced Ned's decision to raise Jon snow ?,"Hey, first time posting here so i don't know if anyone already came up with this theory, but what if Bran shouting ""Father"" during the Tower of joy event unconsciously influenced him to be a Father to jon snow ? 
That would explain why Bloodraven brought him at this specific time and let him shout it and THEN bringing him back to the present. He could've easily prevented it.
The reason behind it would be that bloodraven would know that the best way for Jon snow to survive and then be near the wall was if Ned took him as his son.

I know it's a bit of stretch, but think about it under Ned perspective, you are rushing to see your sister and you hear ""father"" but you see no one and there is nobody in miles, you don't understand but you move on, and then, you discover your dying sister with a child, and you realise that this message (maybe coming from the gods ? he might wonder) was meant for him to be a Father to him.

Idk, maybe it's ridiculous but I like it :)

"[No Spoiler] If you get to write the ending of Season 8, how would you kill off the characters?",[removed],gameofthrones,True,1526241641,2018-05-13
"[No Spoilers] If you get to write the ending of Season 8, how would you kill off the characters?","Myself, I would kill off a lot of fans favorites, and here would be how they would die:

**Rhaegal** - Team Snow/Daenerys had a great plan to destroy the WW, but Cersei ruined it by attacking Team Snow/Daenerys blindsided. Killed Rhaegal in the battle, but Cersei lost the battle.

**Cersei** - Cersei fucked it up the plan to save Westeros and lost the battle. Jaime is tired of the bitch and regrets being with her all those years. Murdered her by choking her.

**Ice Viserion** - The battle became pretty even between the good guys and the WW, all because of Cersei. Ice Viserion was slaughtering the no-name soldiers in the good side, but Drogon was able to kill off Viserion after a hard fought battle between the two.

**Drogon** - Drogon fought hard against Ice Viserion, injured and crashed to the ground. Night King finished it off by freezing it into ice and it shattered into pieces.

**Daenerys** - Jon Snow was fighting the Night King, and of course Night King was better. Night King was just about to kill off Jon Snow, but Daenerys sacrificed herself to save Jon Snow. She is with her dragons now.

**Night King** - Jon Snow went into mad-rage berserk mode after Daenerys died, it becomes a closer battle with the Night King. Jon Snow took a stab in the abdomen by the Night King, but at the same time, Jon was able to give a lethal strike at the Night King and defeated the Night King.

**Jon Snow** - The Night King is dead, Jon Snow bled out in the battlefield due to his wound.

Some supporting Characters can die here and there, like Brienne and Tormunds die together, The Hound (after defeating the Mountain), and Jorah dies by saving Daenerys.

Arya will live, but she rejoins the faceless men to serve the god of death. Bran went back far into the North, became a tree, he was the old 3-eyed raven all along. Sansa will be the Lady of Winterfell.

[Spoilers] Could Bran have also...,"There is a theory out there that Bran might be traveling back in time to view the Mad King, to gain some knowledge while an attack by the White Walkers puts him into a similar position and like with Hodor he says something to the effect of ""burn them all"" and his echo through time causes that event. 

There is another event where characters behaved in a way that caused destruction to those they love and themselves I've been wondering if Bran might have been involved in. Rhaegar had a strong belief his son would be the prince that was promised and a strong belief in portents and visions. 

Could a vision have been planted by Bran? Could Bran have convinced him to have Jon, knowing Jon would be needed, and this was what caused him to forego his two prior children and also give Jon the name Aegon? This might also explain how Jon ended up with that name, if Rhaegar was given a prophecy or vision that convinced him the first Aegon was doomed but an Aegon was needed, he might seek out a way to make another. It would explain his and possibly Lyanna's willingness to cause this gigantic war to create a child, a child they were led to believe must be created at all costs...by Bran using the guise of prophecy.

[No Spoilers] The Expanse needs your help,"**First some disclaimers**

I am sorry when this goes against the rules of this Subreddit, it only fits the 1st point of the posting rules very loosely, and this may be the reason I have not seen a post mentioning this on here. I am sorry if it doesnt fit and makes you work, but I believe this series is worth it.

**Now to the meat**

*[Here is a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8iq1a0/renewal_megathread_earthers_martians_belters_we/) when you already know about the series.*

The Expanse is a Science Fiction TV series that aired on Syfy until the 3rd season, which is currently still beeing aired. In most other countries it if found on Netflix. It is an excellent series, getting a [Rotten Tomato score](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_expanse/) of 100% with the last season, 95% with the 2nd Season and 76% with the 1st Season, meaning it has really been improving.

The Expanse is based on a book series which [GRRM himself](https://grrm.livejournal.com/457140.html) has promoted.

Unfortunately due to the nature of the Expanse and Syfy apparently not beeing all that compatible with each other Syfy has canceled the show after this 3rd Season. Now us Fans are desperate to have some other company (currently Amazon seems the most likely) provide the support to keep this Series going.

So again, more information on this situation and how you can help can be found in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/8iq1a0/renewal_megathread_earthers_martians_belters_we/) reddit post.

[Spoilers] Who would be on your Small Council?,"Congratulations! You're the new King/Queen of Westeros, now you have to set up your Small Council, who would you pick for each spot? (All picks have to be alive at the time of the series, no picking Aegon the Conqueror.)

Here's mine:

Hand of the King: Davos Seaworth - I know Tyrion will probably be the popular pick here, but I am picking Davos because he is the best diplomat in the series, and I need someone who can manage the... stronger personalities that I am going to put on my Small Council. And Davos' loyalty is almost beyond question. 

Master of Coin: Littlefinger would be the obvious pick here ability-wise, but since I don't want a civil war... Olenna Tyrell. She was the de facto head of the (actual) richest house in Westeros for decades, she can be trusted to keep the country's books balanced. Plus, she would liven up the meetings with her sassy humor.

Master of Whisperers: Varys, obviously. Admittedly, he might not be the most loyal fellow, but since I intend on being a good king, I think I should be relatively free from any plotting.

Master of Laws: Tyrion Lannister - He is fair-minded with an inbuilt sense of justice, but also an intense pragmatism that will make him great at the role. I need to put a Lannister on the Small Council to placate his father, and I will need him to help Olenna lighten the mood in light of my next two picks...

Master of Ships: Stannis Baratheon - Kind of a default pick here, as he smashed the Iron Fleet during the Greyjoy Rebellion, and he has the distinct advantage of being the only accomplished naval commander in the country who is not a Greyjoy.

Lord Commander of the Kingsguard: Jon Snow - He's an experienced warrior who's personally killed something like 60 people onscreen in the show, he's no one's fool, and he takes his oaths seriously. I feel safer already.

Grand Maester: OK, so technically the Grand Maester isn't actually picked by the King, but as Bobby B said ""I'm the king, I can do what I want."" I'm going with Maester Aemon, since the only other Maesters we really get to know are Luwin and Pycelle. He's a good advisor and a needed calming factor in a room full of strong personalities.

Queen: Not actually a member of the Small Council, but an important political role nonetheless, I'm going with Margaery Tyrell. She is charming enough to make me seem likable, she has a good head for politics, and so long as I'm nice to her, her grandmother (probably) won't poison me.

So, what did you think of my picks, who would you pick instead?",gameofthrones,True,1526342412,2018-05-14

[Spoilers] Elective Monarchy in Westeros,"TL;DR I think Westeros should be an absolute cognatic elective monarchy with the Lord Paramounts as the electors and the Houses of the Crownlands as the potential subjects of the votes.

I was thinking about Dany and Tyrion talking about succession after Dany if she wins. Dany is concerned since she believes she can't have kids, but Tyrion mentions that there are other ways to pick a successor, like in the Night's Watch.

That made me think about how Westeros could have an elective monarchy. I'm just spitballing, but one way it could work is if each Lord Paramount was given one vote. That's 7, so odd number. So probably no ties. But to try to balance power, I thought it would he interesting if the Lord Paramounts could vote, but not for one another. They have to pick a lesser lord as the subject of their votes. 

However, I was concerned that if a vassal of one the Paramounts were elected, there would be too much pressure on that family so that the Paramount of the land where that person was from would essentially rule. The solution  I thought of to this is that the 7 Lord Paramounts vote for one of the Houses from the Crownlands. That House then rules till the head of house dies, then the Lord Paramounts vote for a new king. This would stop some level of undue influence from the Lord Paramounts while also ensuring that the Lord Paramounts keep a majority of their influence. This is important so they will agree to go along with the plan.  

My plan is far from perfect, but I think it would at least be interesting. Thoughts?

Feel free to tear it to shreds, I like thinking about this stuff and would love to hear why it would/wouldn't work. Thanks in advance!",gameofthrones,True,1526345909,2018-05-14

[Spoilers] Theory on the White Walkers,"I have a theory on why the ww are active now. I think that part of the pact that ended the long night was the stipulation that there must always be a stark at Winterfell. During Robert's rebellion, Ned's father, and brother died in King's Landing, Lyana was in Dorne, and Ned and Benjen were off fighting the war. Ned married Catlyn at Riverrun. Thus, at the time of the wedding, there were no Starks at Winterfell. I think that broke the magic that kept the WW at bay. Then they slowly woke up. In both the book and the show, wildling are fleeing south of the wall in larger numbers. The nights watch had heard the rumors for years. Benjen was sent out to look for WW, and Osha indicates that WW have been waking up for some time. They started small, but over the course of 15 years until our story begins, they have increased in size and the threat has slowly been realized by those further south.",gameofthrones,True,1526352793,2018-05-14

[spoilers] I’m a little drunk. Rant!,"Watching GOT re-runs with a few drinks. I just finished S3 E8 where Sam kills the white at the end... Told you there was spoilers.... There are like 100 crows all squeaking right before the 1st white walker enters. I think all these crows are past 3 eyed ravens/wards. They knew this was a huge moment in history, so anyone with the power to ward or be like the 3 eyed raven were there to see this epic moment in history through the eyes of these animals. They all went silent right before Sam killed the white because they all knew it was happening or all wards transported to their birds/animals at this exact moment because they knew this was a huge moment in history. 

TL:DR Birds go silent at end of S3 E8 because a bunch of 3 eyed ravens/wards show up to see the biggest moment in their history so far.

[Spoilers] Thoughts on Valyrian Steel,"*Greetings! This is a semi cross-post from a thread I also posted to [/r/asoiaf](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/8jip6m/spoilers_main_valyrian_steel_a_fresh_take_on_how/) It is not an exact x-post because for some reason it would not let me link it from that page. 

I reposted here to also get thoughts from others. Thanks!*


So I've been thinking about this for quite some time, and I realize that theorizing about Valyrian Steel is nothing new. However, after searching through both this sub and the ASoIAF wiki, I've found no theory connecting the **exact** same strands of tin-foil as my own; the closest I could find was a 3 year old post on this sub written by [/u/Scrotumbrella Here] (https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2et0j0/no_spoilers_a_metallurgic_look_at_valyrian_steel/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) . 

With that, I thought I might as well throw my helmet into the tourney grounds. 

To start, [steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel): 

&gt;Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon and **other elements**

Pretty basic, but I still wanted to highlight and put emphasis on the end. It is an alloy of iron, and is not solely composed of it + carbon. Other minerals can be present and still count as steel. 

An alloy of steel which is already present in our world, is that of steel and silicon (the principle element of obsidian) named [Ferrosilicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrosilicon):

&gt;Ferrosilicon is an alloy of iron and silicon with an average silicon content between 15 and 90 weight percent. It contains a high proportion of iron silicides.

Continuing with that Wikipedia entry, Ferrosilicon seems to mostly be used to help deoxidize steel, not really useful for weapons, however the proof of concept is still there. 

Silicon is, of course, the main content in [Obsidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian) . A funny thing about [Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) is that it is in the [same group of elements as carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_group) ; a fascinating thing about the elements is that:

&gt;The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics 

Therefore, Silicon and Carbon behave relatively the same. 

Silicon + Iron + [coke (for carbon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)) = steel alloy.

To make steel, lets take a quick look at this video from the [Discovery Channel YouTube page](https://youtu.be/i6BIyQJZdTg?t=33s) :

&gt;called the blast furnace, because as the ore and coke flow downward, they are met by a **1600 degree blast of hot air moving at 110,000 cubic feet per minute**

Now, if only there were some way to recreate a blast furnace: oh wait, dragons! So I think that dragonfire was used to replicate the blast furnace needed to create steel. Not a giant stretch, again, but please keep bearing with me.

We know that steel was not new to the people of Essos after a certain point. The Andals are known to have invaded Westeros with steel weapons, and that was how they were able to drive the First Men back past the Neck and keep them in the North. Taken from [Wiki of Ice and Fire](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Coming_of_the_Andals) :
 
&gt;They were tall and fair-haired warriors who carried steel weapons and the seven-pointed star of their gods painted on their bodies.

So since the people of Essos were familiar with steel, it should not be a stretch to believe that those people who had giant flame-breathing dragons could use their resources to burn more impurities out of their iron when mixing it with other minerals and materials.

But now we get to the really cool part. The *iron*.

I believe, that more than just the addition of [dragonglass](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonglass), it was the iron requirements that made Valyrian Steel both hard/impossible to forge, but also corresponded to its absurdly high price - even at the height of the Freehold.

Since the fall of Valyria, the only people known to be able to even work with Valyrian Steel are the people of the Free City of Qohor. Taken from the Wiki article on [Qohor](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qohor) : 
&gt;According to Maester Pol, blood sacrifices are used when the Qohorik rework Valyrian steel.

*Blood*. We know from Melisandre and others throughout the texts that blood is known for its magical properties. What I doubt the people of Planetos would know of is [Hemoglobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin) : 
&gt;Hemoglobin, abbreviated Hb or Hgb, is the **iron-containing** oxygen-transport metalloprotein in the red blood cells of all vertebrates

So now we have a magical liquid, which also contains iron. Iron, of course, being the necessary prerequisite to forging steel. But blood (even gallons of it) wouldn't be enough iron to forge a spoon, let alone a sword. So we need another source of iron on top of this.

[Dragonbone](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonbone)
&gt;**Dragonbone is black due to its high iron content. It is as strong as other metals, such as steel, yet lighter and more flexible**

So now we have a high iron content material, as strong as forged steel, in quantities enough to be worked with. What would be hot enough to melt dragonbone? Dragonfire. Now with molten dragonbone as the source of material, sprinkle in some dragonglass (i.e. frozen fire) and add in some extra iron-containing and deus ex magica blood, and you have the necessary materials to forge a perfect metal. 

In this way you also have a ""renewable"" resource in dragonbone. Though, with the long lives of dragons, the bone was never in high-enough quantity to be able to make enough Valyrian Steel to equip an entire army, you could at least make enough weapons for the absolute elite. How other smaller houses in Westeros were able to amass the fortunes (or what have you) to trade for a Valyrian Steel weapon is still a mystery. 

However I think that this is how it all came to be.

**TL:DR Dragonbone + blood + dragonglass + regular steel knowledge + dragonfire = Valyrian Steel**",gameofthrones,True,1526361797,2018-05-15

[SPOILERS] Can we have an open an honest discussion about this Dany scene from the show?,"[This is the photo in question] (https://imgur.com/a/nP6ZgEJ) (Dany being surrounded and lifted up by the freed slaves of Yunkai)

Every once in a while, I see a post about this scene being problematic because it depicts all these brown people holding up a single white person as if she were a higher being.  They argue (understandably) that it's making a very racist statement.

While the imagery here definitely has problematic racial overtones, I would argue that what lead up to this image was casting decisions that were probably made with the intent of placating the same groups who have complained about it.

In the books, it's made very clear that slavery on Planetos is unlike the Euro-American slave trade in that *any* wayward ship or unprotected waterside town can fall victim to slaver ships. Sure a good portion of the slaves are made up of people from central &amp; eastern Essos who fell victim to the Dothraki, but there would also be many unfortunate drifters, foreign criminals and LOTS of wildlings from hovels on the northeastern Westerosi shores (such as Hardhome) 

On GoT, it seems to me as if the show runners decided that viewers would be offended by, or otherwise, couldn't accept there being slaves of all different skin tones.  I would bet a million dollars that if they had cast the slaves differently, there would have been at least a few articles on sites like Salon.com and The Guardian complaining that the show was attempting to minimize the atrocity of the Euro-American slave trade &amp; it's racial connection by trying to ""de-racialize"" slavery on the show.  I can definitely see them attempting to avoid bad publicity.

Anyway, just looking for some feedback on these thoughts...",gameofthrones,True,1526395249,2018-05-15
Visiting Ireland - what GOT sets/locations are worth seeing?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1526397411,2018-05-15
[SPOILERS] Battle in the north theory,"So...I've been thinking about this for a while now. As we all know, the army of the dead has finally arrived, and it wouldn't be exagerated to say our heroes are outnumbered about 5 to 1 but does it really matter? For a difference in numbers to assure victory, the numbers would have to be really high or for both sides to have equal capabilities. Besides the numbers, the army of the dead have infinite stamina, some giants and a dragon, but the living have a big suplly of weapons that can kill umdead with ease, large balistas and two dragons, plus horses and the ability to form strategies. When you take it all into consideration, the undead army doesn't have that much going for it, especially so if we think back to Stanis's victory over the wildlings where he was similarily outnumbered.

BUT. I don't think we have the whole picture just yet. The Night King likely hasn't waited so long to pass the wall and not have a game plan, counting on sheer numbers instead. While a cold war would be favourable for him, I don't think that's what would actually happen in this seroes ending war. Now, think about this: All his enemies are gathered at wintherfell for the final battle, all besides Cersei who will most likely get the Golden Company and head somwhere far away to wait out the war. 

Taking all this into account, this would leave the highest concentration of human, King's landing completely defenseless. As such, I think the army of the dead will be led by a few white walkers while the Night King, Vyserion and the other white walkers would go around them using the storm as cover and bathe King's Landing in blue fire(which I highly doubt has the same propertoes as regular fire since an undead could breath it). Thus, the army in the north will defeat the 100 000 undead with high casualties while winther will rise in the south, The Night King claiming a new army of 1 000 000 soldiers.

For example Hodor seemed like a mentally challenged character just there to get Bran from point A to B until you find out about what happened to him why he only says Hodor I was blown away that they had that set up in season 1 and planned that far ahead. 
Then there is the battle of the bastards not only is it the most visually stunning battle I've ever seen on TV but it's so satisfying to see the Boltons pay for their part in the red wedding. 
Next is Arya's development she went from a little girl to a badass that killed Frey and Littlefinger 
And my last point is at the battle between the Dothraki and Lannisters never before have I seen a tense moment where I didn't want either character to die but when Danerys was riding her dragon toward Bron on the Arrow launcher I was scared for both.

[SPOILERS] Something no one thought before...I think,"So before I start I want to say I am aware that this character is probably (and sadly) not going to appear in S8 so this will be a BOOK ONLY discussion. But now I got that out of the way let's continue, So as we all know GRRM said we would see Howland Reed in the story at some point but what will he be like when we see him. Because last night as I was going to bed I kept thinking to myself ""What if when Howland appears and some point afterwards it is revealed he has gone Rouge and is a villain?"" No I am not saying he will start out as one but what if he is introduced and we are led to believe he is a good guy only for it to revealed he has gone rouge and Pro-WW/NK (if there is an NK in the books), that would in my opinion be a very unexpected twist.",gameofthrones,True,1526464171,2018-05-16

[NO SPOILERS] Question about bastards,"So we know that children of bastards are given the last name of Snow/Sand/Rivers/etc (depending on where they were born). We also know that children (in the GoT universe) take their father's last name.

So if a bastard (let's say, named David Sand) marries a woman and they have a legitimate son named Hubert, their child would be named Hubert Sand, right? Even though he wouldn't be a bastard himself, since his parents were married.

But to anybody who knows Hubert's full name, they would assume that he *is* a bastard because he has the last name Sand.

[Spoilers] Vague possibly ridiculous theory from show-watcher,"Lots of spoilers and a quick disclaimer! I've not read the books, so my information on those come second hand. This is just a theory that came to mind, and may be quite dumb, haha. 
So here it goes:
It's theorized that in the books, as Robb and Jon died, they said their wolfs' names and thus warged into them. I've also heard there MAY be a dragon under Winterfell or something. 
In the show, Ned says something right before he dies, only we don't know what it is. What if he's saying the dragon's name, and thus wargs into the dragon? 
Bran later tells Jon of his parentage, and tells him of the dragon under Winterfell, and Jon's Targaryen blood awakens the dragon from some magic-coma. I'm not sure how they'd know the dragon was Ned (probably Bran'a vision or Jon's dragon-connection).
I'm also not sure of the significance of Ned being a dragon, maybe it's just something cool that could happen.

[SPOILERS] COTF and the end of the show...,"There seems to be two schools of thought on the subject. 

One group feels that the COTF are pretty much served their purpose and are done with the show. They were there for creating Bran/Three Eyed Raven and anything from this part of the story (Jojen, the creation of the NK, White Walkers, COTF) is more or less just going to revolve around Bran and his quest to stop the evil NK that is a mindless force of destruction. The COTF made Bran as a final amends for having made the WW and he will help the savior of mankind to defeat the evil Night King. Then the show will deal with Cersei and the ""game of thrones."" I feel like this group also discounts magic playing into the story too much and probably prefers the Machiavellian mischief. 

The second group I feel is looked on as more tin foily. They think the COTF are not on the side of man and there's more to what's going on with their motives with Bran. The Night King might have a deeper motive than what we assumed as well and the end of the show will deal with his motivation, the COTF history (possible more scenes with them) and resolve a lot of the more magical elements of the show such as Azor Ahai, the Lord of Light, Bran's ""time travel"" etc.

For me personally, I think the recent showing of the COTF in the cave paintings leads me to think they may still factor in, Hodor reveal and with Bran whispering and Ned turning leads me to believe Bran will do something in the past again, the Lord of Light and Stannis downfall and Melissande will also have some kind of reveal or resolution, Weirwood trees, Jojen and his quest to make Bran the Three Eyed Raven and tragic death, the shocking reveal that the COTF made the WW and no one has ever found out (Bran still hasn't mentioned it to anyone), these things all draw my interest and I hope there is connective tissue and some answers if not a neat bow. 

As much as the early part of the show was about Cersei, Littlefinger, Joffrey and political intrigue...post Bran's return I think that aspect has taken a strong hold and for me I hope for payoff from the magical side... 

Just curious which camp most fall into and what aspect of the show they prefer.

"[Spoilers] Cersei’s story is actually really tragic, it’s so good!","I’m pretty sure you guys know about alt-shift-x

It’s been a while but I remember watching his video over Cersei, and to be honest the more I learned about her...I kinda started to sympathize with her.

We see her now at the end of season 7, as a cold hearted evil manipulating monster, but throughout the story we see reasons that she turned out the way she did.

Being torn away from Jamie, being married off like just a piece of meat and not an actual human by Tywin, being abused by Robert. Being abused by the high sparrow, being haunted by the prophecy she was told as a child.

One scene that strikes the hardest with me is in season 1, when she is talking to Robert and she asks “was there ever a time...that we could have possibly made things work?”

It felt like to me that despite being married off to a brute “Frat boy” (Bobby B) Cersei still tried to make the best of the situation, and tried to fall in love with him, but his obsession with Lyanna made it impossible for her.

Or the scene in which she is talking to Tyrion about how Joffrey is out of control and she believes it’s karma for committing incest with Jaime. She seems so vulnerable and human in these scenes.

I love that, I love how the villain  gets the explanation for why they are the way they are. Nobody is born evil, it’s 90% product of their upbringing and I’m glad they explain Cersei’s well here ",gameofthrones,True,1526584107,2018-05-17

[SPOILERS] Cave scene main wall drawings and the similarity to The Citadel's library?,"This may be very simple minded but bear with me. From the first episode we see an armillary sphere in the opening credits. We also see one at The Citadel. It seems as if it was designed to cast light around the library. The music in itself relaid the importance of that scene (to me anyway- really beautiful music.)  I also feel that way about the Cave scene.  

Anyways, if you were to see the library through Sam's eyes and understand the significance of that place for whatever reason and asked to relay that into the future using a cave wall, I would imagine it would look very similar to what is depictied. The large ""armillary"" sphere would be projecting light... like a sun... the horizontal lines against the wall naturally built in or not... would depict the levels of the Library. I would also imagine that timing is everything in these circumstances and that they were designed to make sense when the time was right. There is also a man who appears to be sitting... maybe in a library? 

Also regarding the importance of the armillary sphere. We see lots of circles, some more complex than others, but we see about three different designs. By combining these circles into an armillary sphere... what would we have? 

The Citadel, from above and depicted in the series itself, is located on a small circular island, surrounded by another circular barrier of land. A circle within a circle... and a bridge of land connecting both land masses crossing between them. From above this could depict some signs we have seen. The importance of The Citadel maybe? And we would have seen it from episode one by the dead bodies formed into that shape. For whatever reason the WW understand the importance of that location. 

Just my thoughts. 

There was also another reddit user u/arg6531 who pointed out the similarity between one cave painting and Jamie Lannister. To me it has to be Jamie. Left handed holding a sword, while there was a clean cut line on his right arm depicting what Jamie is today. Can't be coincidence. The beings that carved and drew on that wall had to have seen into the future. Knowing that, I anticiapte that the main wall in the cave scenes was in fact a depiction of The Citadels library.

[SPOILERS] Olenna Tyrell appreciation post,"Can we just appreciate what a fucking savage Olenna was? Like damn

~ when she’s in Littlefinger’s brothel and says “and if I should meet with some accident here at your broken little flesh shop, they’ll never even find what’s left of you”

~ her meeting with Margaery with Septa Unella in tow: “you’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle, and my men will stroll in here, and bash you about until I tell them to stop, IF I tell them to stop”

~ when she confesses to murdering Joffrey: “I’d hate to die like your son, clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. Must’ve been horrible for you, as a kings guard, as a father; it was horrible enough for me, a shocking scene, not at all what I intended. You see, I’d never seen the poison work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me” This is one of the greatest mic drops in Game of Thrones history, if not the greatest. Olenna hates Cersei so much that she used her last words just to rub it in that she killed her son. Olenna Tyrell is goals

~ what she says to Cersei 🤣🤣🤣: “I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age it’s hard to recall, but the truly vile do stand out through the years”

~ Cersei and Olenna pt. 2: “My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What’s left to work with?” Nothing like kicking your enemy when she's down.

~ Olenna in Dorne: “what’s your name again? Barbaro? Obara! You look like an angry little boy. Don’t presume to tell me anything”

~ Tyrion se Olenna: “I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.” Such a good read that even Tyrion, Master of Insults, was incapable of a comeback.",gameofthrones,True,1526769800,2018-05-19

The Forgotten Kingdom
Whispered words on withered wings
carrying somber tones into the wind
for no one shall hear them sing
rather spread the barbed truth that stings

“Dark wings, dark words”
they fear, they sneer, they utter, they mutter
oncoming stares and glares
awaiting the unknown message
with scarce a stutter

Wicked words their way come
wars, wrath, rage, violence
their prayers for refuge and rescue
answered with naught but silence

For cavalier kings fighting for 
just cause
playing for wealth and lavishness
forgetting about their pawns

But when all the land is ravaged
by man and beast both savage
when the game of thrones is won
the number of those to rule shall be none

As they stand in the desecration
and chaos they have churned
and weep rueful tears into the kingdom of ashes
never acquiring what they always yearned

[SPOILERS] The Incredibly Shitty Life of Hizdahr the Lorax,"In Game of Thrones, all men must die, and yet not all can die in glory. Some get constantly humiliated by their peers for no reason, then die. Some die in really gruesome ways. One guy was constantly humiliated, died in a really gruesome way, and also had his father crucified for good measure. This is that guy's story.
Anyone remember Hizdahr? Anyone at all?

Just as a quick note: this is about show-Hizdahr, and not book-Hizdahr, who may or may not be evil. Also, I don't hate Daenerys at all, so this isn't meant to be an attack on her, even though it does touch on how weak her writing was in Season 5. My only reason in making this is that, even amid all the characters who have died over the course of this show, Hizdahr weirdly stands out to me for the mix of how completely miserable and embarrassing his every scene was, and how totally unfortunate his inevitable end turned out to be. Just one of Season 5's many unmourned casualties, he remains unremembered even in the direst days of our hiatus fan-wanking. With this retrospective, I hope that at least one solitary person will reflect on this guy and his incredibly shitty life.

** *Hizdahr's Terrible Life ACT ONE: ""The Shits of the Father,"" in which your dad is horribly crucified**

You, unfortunately, are Hizdahr zo Loraq, a hip young slaver from Meereen, born and raised. The fighting pits were where you spent most of your days. Now, however, someone is besieging your city. Turns out it's that dragon queen everyone is excited about, and she is very unhappy. Probably about the whole slavery thing, which is admittedly a dick move. Well, she took the city alright, and now people are going to be crucified, because of those hundred-plus children who were crucified by the Great Masters earlier. Again, dick move, but your father was one of the few who spoke against it, so he's safe, right?

Nope.

Your father died a long, slow, painful death for a crime he didn't commit, and is now feeding the crows. Turns out that the dragon queen apparently did absolutely no work whatsoever in determining who actually supported the crucifixions, because asking around for five minutes probably would have cleared his name. Oops. You would really like to bury him, but the dragon queen won't let you. You need to go to her and literally beg on your knees to your father's killer if you want his corpse back, presumably so he can go to whatever foreign afterlife your vague, unspecified religion (something to do with Graces?) mandates. Your culture is never really expanded upon, but who cares? None of you are main characters, after all.

Shortly after, you're given the job of going to Yunkai and demanding their surrender to the aforementioned father-killer. Apparently she feels that crucifying someone's dad is the best first step of assuring loyalty. Thanks, I guess?

** *Hizdahr's Terrible Life ACT TWO: ""The Shittening,"" in which your loyal advice is rudely ignored**

For some unknown, never-explained motive, you actually are loyal to Daenerys ""Free that slave, put your dad in a grave"" Targaryen, and you do the job she gave you. For some reason. You get to happily strut into the Great Pyramid and tell her that peace with Yunkai is secure. Heck, the Wise Masters are willing to give power over to a council of freed slaves and former slavers who will defer all decisions to Daenerys. Plus, it was at virtually no cost whatsoever! As a testament to your savvy negotiating skills, literally the only thing the Yunkish want is for the fighting pits to reopen. The pits are a bit bloody, of course, but only willing volunteers will have to compete from now on, and the common people love it. So, you secure peace, raise money for the city, and work on that whole ""panem et circenses"" thing. Hooray! ""Can't wait for the gal who killed my father to hear!""

Turns out, she hates this deal. This is one of the worst trade deals, maybe ever. She hates it as hard as someone can hate a deal that is clearly in their favor and requires absolutely no sacrifices on her part. You even bring up that the pitfighters themselves really want to do it again, something that Daenerys' dickhead mercenary friend agrees with, and she still says no. She says that she is a queen, not a politician, and thus never ever needs to compromise ever. While that makes for a badass quote, you sort of assumed there was some overlap between the two. Oh well, guess your hard work was all for nothing.

Not long after, one of Daenerys' followers murders a prisoner, and she decides to execute him publicly. You point out that it would be better to do so without any crowds to see it, for fear of pissing off the freedmen. That dickhead mercenary guy responds by saying he wants you dead, and has been pushing Daenerys to kill you, so you shut up. Right after, Daenerys executes the former slave in front of a huge crowd. Unsurprisingly, everyone in the crowd is completely pissed off and start killing people left and right. Which was the exact thing she was trying to prevent. Oops again, I guess.

Next episode, you argue to her again that she should reopen the fighting pits to prevent war with Yunkai, placate the common people, and give the pit fighters a chance at glory. You also tell her that if she doesn't show that she respects her conquered people's traditions, tensions will flare and more people will die. She refuses, tensions flare up, and more people die not even a minute after.

** *Hizdahr's Terrible Life ACT THREE: ""Shit and Sensibility,"" in which you are violently forced into marriage*

Turns out that one of the people who gets killed is that awesome knight Ser Barristan, who died so that Grey Worm could be a boring character and dry hump women to his heart's content (by the way, thanks for that D &amp; D). The queen is pissed, so being the loyal servant you are, you go to give advice on what to about the Harpies. However, when you show up, she has you thrown into a cell with all the other former masters.

Apparently she hasn't gotten any better at the whole ""find out who is innocent or guilty before you execute them""-thing that you discussed with her earlier, because the queen shows up and starts feeding people to her dragons. She flat-out admits that she has no idea if the aforementioned dragon food had anything to do with Barristan dying, but oh well. Guess that whole speech earlier about justice for all was just talk. You try to be brave after watching someone eaten by giant lizards, but basically piss yourself and get left in the dark.

After a good while in captivity fearing for your life, the queen comes back and you beg her to not kill you. Now, though, it seems like she's totally changed her mind. She also tells you that she is marrying you. Apparently you don't get any say in this. So now you're being forced to marry the woman who brutally murdered your father, and whom you know for a fact is willing to have men burned alive and devoured for no reason. Yay? Of course, none of the obvious problems with any of this will ever be brought up, ever.

** *Hizdahr's Terrible Life ACT FOUR: ""A Storm of Shits,"" in which you are mocked and die unloved*

So, you're at the fighting pits with your forced-marriage bride. Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious that everyone thinks that you're leading the Sons of the Harpy, and all of them hate you, even that drunken dwarf that showed up recently. The dickhead mercenary literally points a knife at your throat not a foot away from Daenerys ""Execute 'em some more, now get in my red door"" Targaryen, and she doesn't say a word about your life being threatened. Hell, she seems happy that he does it!

So she and the mercenary both insult you for saying that a larger, stronger fighter usually wins out over a smaller one, and she belittles you for never having killed someone yourself, despite the only person she ever killed that way being her vegetable ex-husband. Immediately after, the stronger fighter obviously wins, but no one acknowledges that you were right. After that, the dwarf also insults you, and Daenerys strongly implies that she's going to burn down the entire city and everyone living in it. She seems really fond of doing that.

Then, suddenly, disaster strikes. The Sons of the Harpy are attacking! Thinking quickly, you immediately rush to the queen's side and tell her to follow closely - you know a secret way out. Yes, that's right: you were actually loyal the entire time! All of your suggestions and recommendations were actually made completely and totally in good faith, and all of Daenerys and her friends' suspicions were utterly baseless. But now you can show 'em. Finally, at last, you can prove your worth and loyalty, and--

Nope. You're surrounded by four Harpies out of nowhere and stabbed to death. Daenerys and co. don't even bother to check your pulse before they bail, running out into the middle of the pit for some reason. They leave you behind, bleeding to death on the ground.

And so dies Hizdahr zo Loraq. Abandoned by your wife and all her friends, none of whom will ever even mention you again. Seriously, like not even once in the two seasons after. Literally every time you were on-screen you were belittled, insulted, threatened with death, or had someone close to you killed. Not one time did anyone ever acknowledge your point of view or thank you for your opinion, even though you tried your best and were consistently in the right every time, and when they adopted one of your plans three episodes later. You might have thought that you were meant to be the sympathetic voice of this otherwise alien culture, there to be a contrary voice in the next season and demonstrate the need to understand a conquered people in order to rule them. Turns out, it's just going to be 5 or 6 people from Westeros, Naath, or literally anywhere else making decisions on your people's behalf. Hell, that mercenary guy's going to be put in charge of everything, ten episodes in the future. That makes sense, right?

Now you die, unmourned and unloved, in the city you were desperately trying to serve and save as best you could. No one cares. No one ever cared, and now no one ever will.",gameofthrones,True,1526798154,2018-05-20

[SPOILERS] Thought on the villains of Game of Thrones,"The COTF had their lands destroyed by waves of men time and again who went on to become the great houses of Westeros. In the time since then, throughout each season of the show and the history that has been unfolded we have seen how the great houses made war, schemed and connived, crushed the ""smallfolk"" causing them miserable lives. There are some good rulers, Ned was fair but stern to those under him but from the Mad King to Robert to Tywin to Joffry to the Boltons to even Dorne and Highgarden and Lysa Arryn and her son, these lords and kings generally put their own interests and vendettas above all else and would go to war instantly for their own desires and not the needs of the people.

Now Dany is coming and wants to ""break"" the wheel and cares about those it grinds. Jon is a moral leader who is a somewhat reluctant leader who takes the throne seriously and Sansa seems to have grown into being competent and worries about things like food stocks for her people in the upcoming winter. Tyrion has always seemed to care about the people. Cersei still rules Kings Landing and with the war waging Westeros smallfolk are likely feeling it again as winter comes. 

The real villain/monster is not the Night King (or even the COTF if they do end up in league with him) but the Westerosi warriors that destroy everything in their way going back to the COTF times to the present? If he were coming and Jon/Dany/Tyrion had not emerged the NK would be battling people who were fairly evil...the savage murderers who have failed their people and committed horrific crimes on each other. 

Throughout each successive season we have seen the great houses taken down one by one, the villains were wiped out and it seems like leaders are being forged (by events or design?) who are more capable and empathetic to their people.

"Show you're most excited for: amazon's LOTR, netflix's witcher or the GOT spinoff?","I think its an exciting time to get hyped for medieval fantasy/dark fantasy if you're a fan of the genre.  If I had to guess, all 3 of these will arrive around 2020. I'm a huge witcher 2 and 3 fan and I read all the books, so I might be most excited for it. But I'm also a huge LOTR movie fan and watched them several times but I didn't really like the Hobbit movies. I also really liked the GOT books and the show and think its pretty neat GRRM will possibly have some creative control in how the spinoff show(s) will go.

Whatever you choose, it is good times for medieval fantasy/dark fantasy fans.  There are probably several more im forgetting or not even aware of, but to me, these 3 are my most anticipated shows.

So what if in season 8, Bran saw Hodor as a wight and he got all emotional at seeing him that way and it somehow gave him a piece of his humanity back. I feel like that would be awesome. I don’t want the creators to keep bringing back dead characters and making main characters feel invincible anymore than they already have, but I feel like this is a good exception. I’m not sure if this has been said somewhere already or not, but I haven’t seen it anywhere yet and I’m sorry if it has been said. I can delete if everyone wants me too.

Given that the date of the Comic-Con is in July, and assuming that season 8 is released before July, for example in April, will the panel be held in 2019? Or is it necessary that it be after July of the same year? And, in the event that it opens before July 2019, will it have the Comic-Con GoT panel in 2018?

[Spoilers] Who’s more honorable: Jaime or Ned?,"Been thinking about this for awhile. Jaime is widely regarded as having no honor because of the Kingslaying incident (to the public even though we know the truth) but when he is fighting Ned in the streets of KL, he refuses to kill Ned after one of the Lannister soldiers wounds Ned from behind telling Tywin ""it wouldn't have been clean"". Later in s6 we find out that the only reason Ned, a man widely regarded as honorable, beat Ser Arthur Dayne (one of, if not the best fighter in history) only after he was wounded from behind first, and he without hesitation finished him off. Just crazy to think about how these two are perceived by the public but behind the scenes it's a bit of a role reversal in this scenario. ",gameofthrones,True,1525314931,2018-05-02

I think she might be the princess that was promised OR her child is. (he/she)

What if the war is won by Cersei handing over her newborn child to the Night king? The ultimate sacrifice by her / the ultimate redemption.
A bargain struck with the transfer of her child. - That would be pretty bitter sweet.

John and Danny are also involved in this baby fiasco somehow. But one thing is for certain in my mind, the next child that pops out is extremely important.

It could also happen in reverse: John and Danny have a child and a bargain is struck with it.

But either way, I'm certain Cersei is the hero. (I know there was a leak about a certain scene) but my speculation is assuming that is false, or even deliberately placed to mislead.",gameofthrones,True,1525326048,2018-05-03

"[SPOILERS] In the North, Season 1 (continued; in verse)","Here's a third installment of my versified version of Game of Thrones, continuing season 1 from where I left off in my previous post.  
  

Ned read the book of family trees  
and cried out, What the 'eck!  
Wee Joffrey's not bold Robert's son;  
his hair is blonde, not black.  
  
The mystery of Jon Arryn's death  
had now become quite clear.  
They'd killed to stop the shit hit fan,  
or so it would appear.  
  
Jon died from toxic poison, see  
he drank the Tears of Lys.  
Topped off for asking far too much.  
Knowledge shared by Varys.  
  
Ned's threat to tell King Rob the news  
put Cersei in a flap,  
but undeterred, she hatched a plot  
to cause a wee mishap.   
  
King Robert died while hunting boars.  
A case of pure bad luck?  
No way bad fortune was it that  
the queen's assassin struck.  
  
Now made Lord-Regent, Ned desired  
to have Rob's will read out.  
But Cersei would have none of that  
and mocked, We're reading nowt.  
  
A comic scene transpired right then  
with both sides set for strife.  
Seize him! Seize them! The cries went up,  
while Baelish brandished knife.  
  
Ned's men got slaughtered there and then,  
and he was fingered, thrust  
in jail, to hear a little voice,  
I'm one you cannot trust.  
  
Instead of Stannis on the throne,  
the whelp was crowned as king.  
'twas Joffrey's turn to rule the roost,  
but under mother's wing.  
  
Poor Ned was tricked to 'fessing up  
to save his daughters' skin.  
Instead of heading to the Wall,  
Ned's bonce dropped in the bin.  
  
Ned lost his head and Sansa Stark  
was captive of the king,  
but Arya fled with Forel's help.  
That fencer's sword could sing.  
  
In caravan bound for the Wall,  
king's bastard showed her how,  
disguised, she'd be all right a while,  
cried, God, she's 'Arry now!  
  
Robb Stark, the heir, marched south and reached  
the Twins and had to queue.  
The cranky pappy, Walder Frey,  
refused to let 'em through.  
  
That was until a bargain struck,  
for marriage and for aid,  
meant, rashly, Robb had pledged his troth   
to comely, virgin maid.  
  
In Riverrun, with battle won,  
and Jaime caught and bowled,  
retreat became the only choice  
for Tywin and his horde.  
  
The captured Jamie challenged Robb,  
but Stark declined to try.  
He then confessed to pushing Bran,  
but failed to tell Cate why.  
  
The Tullys and the Starks were cheered  
by son's prowess at war,  
while Robb, proclaimed King in the North,  
knew what he'd just fought for.   
  
The Imp was sent to Joffrey's court,  
to reign in his excess.  
The old king's siblings both staked claims  
and vied for some success.
  
Young Robb elected not to side  
with either man for king.  
Instead, he waited for to see  
what series two might bring.

[NO SPOILERS] Game of Thrones Discord Roleplaying Server,"**Game of Thrones: The Winds of War**

In 306 AC, the War of the Five Kings had been raging for eight years by that point. Stannis Baratheon and his forces were in the North, having collected the remnants of Robb Stark’s shattered Northern Army after the Red Wedding. In the South, loyalist forces, a combination of the Lannister and Tyrell armies, along with naval forces under Euron Greyjoy, were attempting to stamp out any remaining pockets of resistance, while gearing up for an invasion of the North. However, to the surprise of both sides, the Night King and his White Walkers launched an invasion of Westeros. Setting aside their differences and power struggles momentarily to defend against the true threat, a massive force of soldiers from every corner of Westeros poured to the North to push back the Army of the Dead.

However, Cersei Lannister, ever the opportunist, believed this was her chance to end the war quickly and easily. Thousands of Lannister and Tyrell troops, secretly held back from the fight against the White Walkers, captured Storm’s End. Cersei believed the war was over. Stannis’ capital was hers, and the united army could do nothing to stop her after having their numbers decimated during the War of Dawn. This was the point the tide of the war changed. Though, not in the favor of House Lannister. Sensing the time for action was now, Doran Martell and Harrold Hardyng, now of House Arryn, joined the war on the side of Stannis Baratheon and the North, now under the leadership of Jon Snow, legitimized as a Stark. Cersei’s allies abandoned her, unwilling to oppose such an overwhelming force. King’s Landing and Casterly Rock were captured, the Lion defeated, and King Stannis sat upon the Iron Throne.

[SPOILERS] Favorite theme/leitmotif in the show?,"&gt;leitmotif: a recurrent theme throughout a musical or literary composition, associated with a particular person, idea, or situation

My two favorites are the Stark theme and Jon/Dany theme. The former (e.g. [Goodbye Brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYIQDpwEt-k) from the S1 soundtrack) I think amazingly captures the heartbreak of just about everything that happens to the Stark family. It's got that really dry, airy cello sound that IMO lends itself really well to fantasy settings. 

The theme for Jon and Daenerys (e.g. [Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4_Psg5mV4c) from the S7 soundtrack) on the other hand gives me this sense of wonder and excitement that I think perfectly represents the dynamic between the two.

They are not the only case of incest in GOT. Craster runs an incest family and he sold his incest born to the white walker. In the show, it also shows that white walker turns the incested children into a white walker. So is white walker related to incest children? Would it be the case that they can only turn incest children into white walker.
So would Cersei, not confirmed, unborn children, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen sex scene and Gilly incest children Sam play an important rule in the coming season of GOT?

Janos Slynt remarks about the ""Wildling Whore"" he was with. Then Alliser Thorne said something really out of character. - ""She's not a whore."" .... To then which Janos Slynt replies ""Oh yeah?

Cersei is smart. I don’t think she would be as vicious and cruel as the Mad King, unless you are truly one of her enemies. Which, as of now, she seems to have defeated almost all of them with the exception of Sansa Stark and Daenerys Targaryen. 

Side note: Maybe Cersei no longer wants Sansa dead, knowing Sansa is innocent of Jofferys murder?

Season 8 leak,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1525467317,2018-05-04
[LEAKS] [SPOILERS] SEASON 8,"This is part 2!!
First outline season 8, episode 6

HBO LEAK

NOTE: FOR THOSE WHO WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED WITH DAVOS SEAWORTH IN EP.5

- He doesn’t have a big role in this episode. He does appear and fight alongside Jon, Jaime, Gendry and co. He doesn’t have lines in this episode but you see him fighting in this episode.

FINAL EPISODE: NOTE THAT MANY THINGS CAN STILL CHANGE AND THIS OUTLINE IS PRELIMINARY.

DURATION: +/- 110 minutes

• The first scene takes place in Dragonstone. Jaime, Bronn, Gendry, Tyrion and ser Davos arrive back in Dragonstone. Edmure supposedly has gone back to Riverrun. Jon receives them and informs them about Daenerys’s death. Tyrion is very saddened when he hears that Daenerys has died and has a chat with Jon Snow on the cliffs of Dragonstone. He tells Jon that he believed in Daenerys. He believed that she could make a better place out of this shit world and that he could better give up on that dream. Further, Tyrion asks what killed Daenerys. Jon mentions that she died in childbirth and the Golden Company took her body to hand it over to Cersei Lannister. He asks what happened with the baby, on which Jon replies that their baby girl is alive and well. Tyrion smiles and then notices a single Greyjoy ship landing in Dragonstone. Jon and Tyrion walk toward the ship. It’s no one but Yara Greyjoy who has arrived in Dragonstone. She informs them that she escaped Euron but lost almost all of her army. Jon asks her about Theon’s whereabouts and she tells him he probably didn’t make it out alive when the dead arrived.

• Next shot is Daenerys’s body hanging from the walls in King’s Landing. The people of King’s Landing are throwing shit at her body and make fun of her corpse. Nearby is an alehouse where Arya and the Hound currently are. They hear that Euron is king now and that King’s Landing will probably face another attack by Euron’s enemies.

Arya wants to help Jon, fight with him, but the Hound thinks he’s done with that shit for now. Arya says she doesn’t care what the Hound does, but she’ll stay to fight alongside her brother. The Hound eventually agree to stay with her and help Jon and co.

• We then see Euron Greyjoy speaking with the Commanders of the Golden Company in the Throne Room. He thanks them for bringing the body of the Dragon Queen to him and thinks it’s a shame that they didn’t bring her alive. He admits that he would have fucked her if they brought her alive. Euron Greyjoy expects that a reckoning is coming from the King in the North and that they should strike first. Euron commands the new Maester to send a raven to every kingdom and write that all of the Great Lords should swear fealty to him otherwise he shall attack them with his army of sellswords from King’s Landing.

• Jon, Jaime, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah, Sansa, Gendry, Davos, Missandei, Samwell and Yara are present at the War Council discussing the message of Euron Greyjoy. Euron Greyjoy has declared himself King of the Seven Kingdoms after Queen Cersei’s tragic death. Jaime is convinced that Euron is behind the murder of Queen Cersei and is furious. Yara agrees with Jaime. Davos states his opinion that this madman shouldn’t be ruling the Seven Kingdoms and they should fight back with everything they got. Gendry expresses his hatred toward Euron as he has taken the Baratheon seat away from his deceased family. Tyrion and Jaime want to use the Lannister army to fight Euron. Tyrion also think they should convince Daenerys’s remaning loyal men to keep fighting for Jon and for Dany’s offspring. So we have the North, the Lannister army and the remaining Dothraki, Unsullied and Drogon fighting for them.

It’s Samwell who later addresses Jon’s parentage again, but Jon doesn’t want Samwell to tell the rest about this. Jon clearly states that he never wants to become a king. It’s Davos who vouches for him. He tells the others that Jon is their last chance to save the people of Westeros from Euron Greyjoy dirty hands and he believes that Jon would make a good king. He’s their only hope. The others agree with Davos and Jon accepts his newly acquired position eventually.

• After the War Council, Jon talks with his sister, Sansa. Sansa is confused with Jon’s parentage and finds it difficult to believe that father always lied to his family, to Catelyn, to Jon. Jon agrees with Sansa and asks her to take care of the North and of Winterfell, as she’s the heir of Winterfell. She agrees and tells Jon she was planning to leave Dragonstone anyway. The two share a hug before parting ways. Missandei informs Jon that the the old woman came to visit him in Dragonstone again. Old Melisandre comes to tell Jon she’s ready to pay for her sins and reveals her identity. She tells a shocked audience that she’s done her part and that the prophecy has come true. Davos vouches to have the witch killed at last. Gendry agrees with Davos. Missandei also points out that she tried to convince Daenerys to have her baby sacrificed to the Lord of Light. Jon proposes to hang Old Melisandre but Melisandre asks Jon to have her killed by fire, because that’s the purest form of death. She’s executed outside of Dragonstone, killed by Drogon’s fire.

• Ships are starting to leave Dragonstone to sail for Blackwater Bay. Tyrion, Missandei, Davos, Samwell and baby Lyanna stay in Dragonstone for the time being. Jorah, Gendry, Jaime and Bronn are seen boarding on the ships. Jon asks Tyrion and Missandei to take care for Lyanna if he doesn’t return alive. Jon also says goodbye to Samwell and thanks him for always being loyal to him.

• Euron is seen on the walls of King’s Landing and sees how Targaryen ships are approaching. Daenerys’s rotting body can be seen as well. We notice Jon Snow, wearing Targaryen/Stark armour and mounting Drogon above the ships. Euron brings forward the scorpions that were redesigned on his orders. Lannister men first land ashore and start to invade. We see men of the Golden Company guarding the city walls. Two Commanders of the GC are riding elephants. The elephants tread on several Lannister men. We can see the Northern army joining the Lannisters and the Dothraki coming from the sides. Jon and Drogon join the fight and Drogon sets one of the commanders together with the elephant on fire. The poor animal stresses out and kills quite some men unknowingly when it dies. We see Yara giving the best of herself with her axe and Gendry smashing a man’s skull with his hammer. Euron commands his men to take down Drogon with the scorpions. He has three of them. First they seem to fail to do so but then Drogon got hit two times in his right wing, prompting him to land. The Lannister army, Stark army and Dothraki fight ferociously and manage to break through the city gates. Jon tries to flee with Drogon to the Dragonpit, because he sees that Drogon is hurting and can’t fly properly anymore. Arya notices that Drogon’s flying toward the Dragonpit. Meanwhile, The Hound has joined Jaime, Bronn and Jorah. Gendry and Yara decide to fight their way to the Red Keep where they think Euron is hiding himself right now. Euron actually commands his men to go to the Dragonpit to destroy the beast together with Jon Snow. Bronn and Jaime see Euron together with the Golden Company moving to the Dragonpit and go with them. Jaime starts to realize that Jon is in danger. He’s the only one besides Tyrion who knows that there’s wildfire left beneath the Dragonpit.

If Drogon start to breathe fire right there, the wildfire could destroy the whole Dragonpit and taking everyone and everything with it.

• Arya and Nymeria now enter the Dragonpit to see Jon caring for Drogon’s injuries. Jon tries to remove the spears out of Drogon’s wings. Jon is very surprised to see Arya there and wants her to leave King’s Landing immediately. Arya doesn’t want to leave Jon at first, indicating that she wants to fight with them. Arya strokes Drogon, commenting that she always dreamed of riding a dragon when she was younger, looking up to the tales of the Targaryen warriors. Jon smiles but strongly implores Arya to leave the Dragonpit now, because they’re in grave danger. They both share a hug before Arya decides to listen to Jon and leave. She’s clearly upset to leave Jon.

• Yara and Gendry are inside the Red Keep but come to the conclusion that Euron has escaped to the Dragonpit, much to Yara’s annoyment because she wanted to finish her uncle.

• Euron and the GC invade the Dragonpit. Euron start to battle Jon Snow. Jaime hastens to the Dragonpit, together with the Hound and Jorah and some Lannister men to get Jon out of there. Bronn doesn’t want to risk his life and stays where he is. Euron almost manages to kill of Jon Snow, but it’s Jaime who suddenly stabs him from behind, mortally wounding him. Jaime tries to get Jon out of the Dragonpit while Jorah and The Hound fight the remaining sellswords to make sure Jon gets out of the Dragonpit. Men of the Golden Company keep throwing spears at Drogon and it’s obvious that he’s dying. At one point, Drogon unknowingly unleashes his fire, causing the Dragonpit to tremble. Jaime realizes that Drogon has caused the wildfire to ignite beneath the Dragonpit and commands Jon to run for his life. A gravely injured Euron laughs before he’s dying, telling them that they are all fucked.

Before Jon, The Hound, Jaime and Jorah can escape it is too late and the wildfire consumes the whole Dragonpit. Nobody makes it out alive. Yara and Gendry witness the wildfire explosion from a distance and watch with much horror. People are seen fleeing King’s Landing before any more wildfire can ignite.

• The next scene takes place in Dragonstone. Tyrion sees a few Targaryen ships returning to Dragonstone. Yara and Theon inform Tyrion, Davos Samwell and Missandei about the wildfire explosion and that Jon, his brother and Jorah probably didn’t make it out alive. Tyrion is broken when he hears the news and so are Samwell and Davos when they hear about Jon’s death. Samwell and Davos have some small talk and Samwell asks Davos what he will do now. Davos tells Sam he’ll probably returns to his wife since he has left her alone for far too long. Samwell smiles and tells Davos he’s planning to do the same thing.

• We then see Arya and Nymeria ready to board on a ship, Arya tells the captain that she’s done with Westeros. The captain asks what a small girl and a wolf are going to do in Essos now that there’s peace in Westeros. Arya responds with ‘Valar Morghulis’. We see Arya’s ship heading east, right before there’s a time jump of 3 years.

• The next shot is Sam teaching Little Sam how to read. Lady Gilly Tarly, how she’s named now, is Lady of the Reach. Sam’s mother, Talla and Gilly look to Samwell and Little Sam and both share they love for these two. Sam comes in between and ask where they’re talking about, but Sam’s mother jokes that it was only women talk. Sam and Gilly share a last scene together. Gilly has good news for Sam. She’s pregnant with his child. Sam’s clearly on cloud nine when he finds out that he’s having his own child with Gilly. He also makes Gilly sure that he’ll always regard Little Sam as his own Sam and he’ll inherit the Reach one day.

• The next scene takes us to Winterfell, where we can see Lady Sansa and Lord Gendry now being together. Sansa watches with Gendry, Edmure and Roslin how Edmure’s sons are sparring with each other. Edmure still holds the title of Lord of Riverrun. Sansa notices that one of Edmure’s sons carries Arya’s sword, Needle and asks how he retrieved it. Edmure answers that his son, Willem, has found the sword in the woods when they were hunting. He asks whether her sister is still alive, at which Sansa responds that she probably would be. Arya always has found a way to survive somehow. Sansa and Gendry visit the crypts of Winterfell. Jon’s statue stands in the crypts as well. Gendry asks Sansa if the truly belongs down there. Sansa says that it is the only place where Jon truly belonged, next to his real father Ned and with his brothers. Gendry jokes that he wasn’t named ‘Jon’ actually. Sansa says that he will always remain ‘Jon Snow’ to her. Sansa mentions that she has a lot of work still to do, as she’s Lady of Winterfell and Lady of the Vale by now. She asks what Gendry will do with Storm’s End, now that it’s left unoccupied. Gendry says he’s planning to do soon after that he’s been ackowledged as a true Baratheon by the King Regent.

• And then we get to see the King Regent and Hand of Queen Lyanna Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion is watching how Missandei is reading a book for Lyanna about the tales of Rhaenys and Visenya Targaryen, before she goes to sleep. Lyanna asks if her mother also rode a dragon and Missandei answers that she was quite a warrior. The next scene, Tyrion and Missandei are seen in bed with each other and talk about Lyanna, that she’s not the most easy-going child. Tyrion mentions that she’s quite good at brooding as well.

Missandei laughs and tells Tyrion that he shouldn’t have expected otherwise with Jon and Daenerys as parents. Tyrion tells Missandei that she’s doing an excellent job in educating Lyanna and the two start to have sex with each other. The last scene with Tyrion is one with Lyanna on the giant map of Westeros. Tyrion tells Lyanna she will rule the Seven Kingdoms one day. He explains that the North and the Vale are currently ruled by Lady Sansa Stark, the only remaining Stark child and that she’s married to Lord Gendry Baratheon, Lord of the Stormlands. The Riverlands are ruled by Edmure Tully. Tyrion himself is in charge of Casterly Rock at the moment, but the castle is left unoccupied still. The Reach is ruled by Lord Samwell Tarly, son of Randyll Tarly. The Iron Islands on the other hands are currently ruled by Yara Greyjoy. Lyanna asks about Dorne, on which Tyrion answers that Dorne is now ruled by one of Oberyn’s daughters. She has been married to a man who has always dreamt of owning a castle and having a fine young lady. Now he has both of them. Now Tyrion and Lyanna walk toward the Iron Throne. Tyrion warns Lyanna that the Game of Thrones isn’t a child’s play and it’s one that comes at a price. Of course, Tyrion assures her that she’ll never have to deal with the Game of Thrones alone and he’ll always be there for her. Last shot is Lyanna and Tyrion staring at the Iron Throne.

• We end with a scene in the far far North, in the Lands of Always Winter. A single White Walker rides to and brings the body of Bran Stark to an altar. Remember that the Night King stabbed Bran in episode 2. He was stabbed in the heart with Dragonglass. He performs a certain ritual and Bran opens his eyes. They’re bright blue. The White Walker puts a crown on Bran’s head and the altar slowly changes into one of ice. Winter is coming…

HBO LEAK

• The episode will have a duration of almost 2 hours.

• The first scene will take place in the Great Hall of Winterfell. Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, Davos and Sansa are present here. Gendry and Tormund tell the rest that the Wall has fallen and the Night Watch destroyed. Tormund also mentions that the Night King rides an undead dragon and that they are severely fucked. Bran Stark confirms Gendry and Tormund’s story and tells that the Night King is on his way to Winterfell. Jon Snow tells the rest that they have no time to lose and asks Maester Wolkan to inform all of their banners, everyone in the North, to prepare themselves for a war against the Army of the Dead. They need to prepare for an attack at the battlefield of Winterfell.

• After having to process a lot of new information and struggling with his identity, Jon Snow goes to the crypts to visit his mother, Lyanna and his uncle, Ned Stark. Daenerys notices that there’s something wrong with Jon and finds him in the crypts. She asks Jon what’s wrong with him. Jon tells her that he even isn’t called Jon Snow. He calls ‘Jon Snow’ a lie people have made him believe all of life. Daenerys is confused and asks Jon for clarification but Jon walks away from her. Daenerys notices that Jon behaves aloof toward her.

• Daenerys walks out of the crypts, which Jorah Mormont notices. He asks her what happened down them in the crypts but Daenerys answers that she doesn’t know what’s up with Jon. She tells Jorah that Jon is hiding something from her. Jorah also tells Daenerys that it striked him that Daenerys has been so absent for days. She answers that she’s not feeling very well lately. Jorah proposes to have her examined by Maester Wolkan.

• Qyburn enters Cersei’s chambers. He mentions that she hasn’t spoken about her miscarriage anymore and that she needs to take enough time to rest. Cersei answers that there’s no time for that and doesn’t want to say more about the miscarriage. Qyburn leaves her chambers, Cersei watches from her window, witnessing how the snow falls in King’s Landing. The next shot is Jaime, riding his horse in snowy conditions. He and Bronn arrive in Riverrun, both discover that the Tullys are once again laying siege to Riverrun. Jaime enters the stage and meets up with Edmure. Edmure tells Jaime he should have him in chains, but Jaime responds that he doesn’t come to argue about the damned castle. He proposes Edmure to help his niece and nephew in the Great War against the Night King. He also promises to give Edmure Riverrun back to the Tullys, since it doesn’t matter any longer who’s holding the castle at this point. Edmure tends to agree, not for Jaime but for his family.

• Most of House Stark’s bannermen and Daenerys’s army have now arrived in Winterfell. Among them is Howland Reed. He arrived with his army and Meera Reed by his side. Arya receives a visitor in Winterfell. He seems to be an ordinary bannerman from House Cerwyn, but he quickly removes his face. It seems to be Jaqen H’ghar. Arya is surprised to have Jaqen visiting her. Jaqen tells Arya the Many-Faced God requires another death, a name to be crossed off her list. He reveals it to be the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister. A price was paid. What better servant of the Many-Faced God than Arya Stark can kill Cersei Lannister. He gives a vial of poison to Arya and leaves her.

• Jon Snow seizes the moment to talk with Howland Reed alone. He asks Howland to confirm Bran’s story, but Howland doesn’t acknowledge this at all. Jon Snow pleads him to tell the truth since Robert Baratheon isn’t alive any longer, there’s no point in lying anymore. Howland ultimately confirms that Ned was carrying Lyanna’s child when he came out of the Tower of Joy. He always promised him to keep this a secret. Jon thanks him for telling the truth anyway.

• Knowing that the Army of the Undead will be upon them very soon, Tyrion, Jon, Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Podrick, Davos, Tormund, Gendry, Varys, Jorah, Theon, The Hound, Grey Worm and Sam discuss together with the Stark bannermen and Daenerys’s army how they will defend the North. Allegedly the Last Hearth has already been attacked by the White Walkers and their castle destroyed. Ned Umber didn’t make it out alive. Tyrion speaks for Daenerys, who’s absent due to illness. He comes forward with a plan to defend the North. Tormund, the remaining Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied will attack with dragonglass from the Dreadfort since that’s where they are heading to first. On their way to Winterfell, the dragons will set the army of the Dead afire and House Stark’s bannermen and the Knights of the Vale will fight weakened forces at the battlefield of Winterfell and hopefully destroy the Night King as well. Jon wants Brienne and Podrick to take Sansa and Arya and Bran with them and to leave with Robin Arryn to the Eyrie.

Arya doesn’t want to and claims that she’s stronger than most men. They need her in the war to come. Jon insists that he doesn’t want that. Jorah also wants to fight alongside House Mormont but Lyanna reminds him that he has betrayed his own House. Varys mentions that he has also received word from King’s Landing. Supposedly, Queen Cersei has bought a great army of sellswords and Euron Greyjoy has taken Storm’s End to install the army there. Theon pleads to have Storm’s End attacked and Gendry agrees since it’s the seat of his father’s house. Jon promises Theon that he will help to destroy Euron and save his sister after they have dealt with the Night King and his army. There’s no time for that now since all of their lives are in danger and they have no choice than to face the Night King and his army. He needs his help and that of the Iron Islanders as well during the battle at Winterfell. A disappointed Theon accepts his proposal.

• Missandei visits Daenerys in her chambers. Daenerys tells Missandei that Maester Wolkan examined her and that he confirmed that she’s pregnant. Missandei asks why she isn’t happy then. Daenerys feels that Jon has changed towards her and doesn’t understand why.

• The Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied prepare to leave Winterfell. Jon asks Daenerys why she didn’t attend this important gathering, but Daenerys doesn’t reply to that as well. Meera goes to say goodbye to Bran in the Godswood in Winterfell when Bran starts to behave very strangely. He pleads Meera to warn them since the Night King’s army is here. Jon is going to say goodbye to Sansa when Meera runs to warn the others. A huge winter storm starts to come closer to Winterfell. Chaos erupts. The North and Daenerys’s army gather outside to face the Night King’s army. Jon orders Sansa, Arya and Daenerys to stay inside Winterfell.

They are too valuable to lose and promises them that Winterfell will not fall. Varys, Tyrion, Robin, Samwell, Gilly, Lyanna and Missandei also remain inside Winterfell. Arya first doesn’t want to but obeys Jon’s wish. Sansa asks Meera to get Bran inside asap. A huge flock of wights invade the battlefield of Winterfell. Dothraki face the Army of the Dead first and many of them are taken out quite easily. Lots of wights keep coming. Ghost fights with Jon and saves him at one point from a wight trying to kill him. Ghost is killed off trying to save Jon. Inside Winterfell, Daenerys is frustrated that she’s not able to help and that she should fly Drogon to destroy the undead. Missandei answers that it’s not wise to join the fight while she’s pregnant. Sam tries to console Gilly and Little Sam. The news surprises Sansa, Tyrion and Varys. Drogon comes in between and takes out a big chunk of the Night King’s army but also kills some of the Northern bannermen in the process. The White Walkers also enters the stage with the Night King flying Undead Viserion above them. Viserion starts to destroy the Northern’s army as well. Lord Glover and Howland Reed die are killed by dragonfire. Tormund leads the Free Folk and fights but is killed by Drogon’s fire. Drogon also manages to kill an undead giant. Meera wants Bran to leave the Godswood but he tells her he has help and Jon and co. Bran is trying to control Rhaegal with his mind. Meera warns Bran that is too dangerous and that he should stay inside. Jon and Daenerys’s army is diminishing greatly since many wights keep coming. White Walkers try to invade Winterfell. Grey Worm faces two White Walkers and is able to take out one of them with his spear from Dragonglass. The other WW kills him. The White Walkers supposedly try to invade Winterfell to take down Bran.

Brienne guards the castle together with Podrick, Jorah and Gendry. Wights and White Walkers and Wights start to invade there as well. Podrick is killed off by a group of Wights, which makes Brienne go psycho and takes out one of the White Walkers as well with Oathkeeper. Meera is urging Bran to give up and get inside but Bran doesn’t want to. He wants Meera to leave instead and get safe inside the castle. Meera answers that she will stay together with him until the end. Jaime Lannister and the Tully forces come to the North’s aid right in time. Bran is managing to warg inside Rhaegal and the dragon starts to fight undead Viserion, trying to bite him right in the neck but gets gravely injured during the fight as well. Rhaegal starts to breathe fire on Viserion, which seems to make the Night King start leaving the battlefield on injured Viserion’s back.

• Meera realizes that this is the end for them. White Walkers are coming for Bran and she gets killed off by the White Walkers while defending Bran’s body. Viserion and Rhaegal keep fighting each other and both start to be seriously injured. It seems like dragonfire can harm the Night King. The White Walkers stab Bran to death, which makes Rhaegal fall to the ground and to be stabbed to death by Wights. The Night King’s army of Undead is starting to diminish. We see Jaime commanding his men and fighting the remaining Undead alongside Bronn. Jon fights alongside the Hound and Davos. The Hound is fighting like a boss right here. When Jon starts to notice that the Night King’s army is retreating as well he commands everybody to leave the battlefield asap and goes with Davos and the Hound to get everyone safely outside now. The Knights of the Vale, Sansa, Brienne and Robin leave together to the Eyrie. Arya, The Hound, Jaime Lannister, Bronn, Edmure Tully, Tully and Lannister forces retreat to Riverrun. Jon, Davos, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Samwell, Gilly, Little Sam, Theon, the remaining Unsullied and Dothraki forces travel south. Lyanna Mormont and her men retreat to Bear Island.

• The last shot we see is Jon and Daenerys on Drogon’s back setting all the dead afire including dead Rhaegal. Both sides suffered great losses in this fight.

• Deaths: Grey Worm, Tormund, Podrick, Meera, Bran, Rhaegal, Robett Glover, Howland Reed

End episode 2

First outline season 8, episode 3

HBO LEAK

• Note that this episode is a bit shorter than the others and has a duration of +/- 60 minutes.

• Jon, Daenerys, Sansa, Robin, Lord Royce, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Varys, Brienne, Tyrion, Jorah, Gendry, Sam, Gilly, Davos, Missandei, Little Sam and Theon all arrive in Greywater Watch. Not all of these characters appear on screen though. They make a stop to rest there and to discuss their strategy to defeat the Night King for good.

• Inside Greywater Watch, Daenerys, Jon, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Tyrion, Sansa, Sam, Davos, Robin and Lord Royce discuss how they will organize themselves before splitting up. Jon proposes to await the Night King’s attack from the Eyrie since the fortress is very difficult to impregnate. Tyrion jokes that the Night King only needs 10 good men to impregnate the bitch, but only Bronn catches the joke. The remaining Lannister and Tully army defend Riverrun together with Edmure, Tyrion, Jaime and Bronn. When the Eyrie gets attacked first, the Night King’s army has to get lured into the Bloody Gate and that’s when the Lannister and Tully forces need to join the attack as well. Theon has to take back Pyke and defend it together with the remaining army of the North and the Ironborn. Jon remarks that Arya and The Hound have not been seen arriving in Greywater Watch. Edmures assures that Arya hasn’t died but simply disappeared when they were retreating from Winterfell. Sansa remarks that she’d be safe with the Hound. She always manages to survive somehow. Jon also wants Sansa and Brienne to join Robin and Gendry to the Eyrie where they’d probably be safer than now. Jon stays with Davos, Jaime, Jorah, Bronn, Tyrion and Edmure in Riverrun. Jon wants Daenerys, to travel to Dragonstone together with Varys and Missandei. Sam and Gilly should travel with her.

Maester Wolkan received bad news, though. Lyanna Mormont didn’t make it to Bear Island and died.

• Next shot is Arya and the Hound travelling on the Kingsroad. The Hound complains to Arya that she should have followed her brother and sister and that she’s a stupid girl to travel alone in the North now that the army of undead fuckers are around. Arya answers the Hound that he shouldn’t have sticked with her if he’s scared. The Hound deduces that Arya is traveling to King’s Landing, but he doesn’t understand why. Arya says that she has to cross one last name off her list. The Hound laughs and tells Arya why she’s still holding that fucking list since everyone will die soon anyway. Arya responds that she needs to kill Cersei herself. The Hound agrees and tells that he has some unfinished business with his brother as well. The two encounter by an old woman, who’s asking after the King in The North. The Hound says that an old woman shouldn’t be alone in the woods with the army of the Night King approaching. The old woman says she doesn’t fear the dead. Arya tells the woman she thinks Jon Snow has traveled south, probably to Dragonstone. The old woman takes a look at Arya and tells her that they have met before. Arya is puzzled about this, the Old Woman leaves.

• During the night, the characters at Greywater Watch sleep in huts. Jon chats a last time with Howland Reed, asking if he joins them to the South since the White Walkers would probably hit Greywater Watch soon. Howland Reed tells that he’s ready to die. He doesn’t care of his life anymore, now with his children being passed away. He tells Jon Snow the Walkers can have him. He tells Jon he also needs to pay for his sins, for killing Arthur Dayne behind his back. He tells Jon the story of how he saw Ned Stark with baby Jon in his arms.

His uncle always wanted to keep him safe, even willing to sacrifice his life for Jon. Howland tells Jon he recognizes a lot of traits of Ned in Jon Snow and says that he would make a good ruler on the Iron Throne. Jon insists that he isn’t interested in that and leaves Howland Reed.

• Then, we see Cersei in King’s Landing. Qyburn visits the chamber of the Hand and informs Cersei that Winterfell has been attacked and that Daenerys and Jon have lost a great deal of their army. Cersei smiles. Qyburn also tells that the Lannister army has joined the Battle at Winterfell apperently. Cersei asks if Jaime has survived, but Qyburn tells he doesn’t know. Cersei answers that he shouldn’t have. After that, Euron arrives back in King’s Landing. He comes to tell Cersei that the Golden Company succefully took Storm’s End and that the army is gathered right there. He tells Cersei he finally wants to receive his reward and they shouldn’t wait to marry and be husband and wife tonight. Cersei reluctantly agrees.

• It’s still night in Greywater Watch and the characters stay there until morning. Jon and Daenerys sleep together in a hut. Daenerys finally tells Jon that she’s pregnant with his child. Jon is surprised and expresses his happiness toward Daenerys. He jokes that this is the only good thing that happened to them at the moment. He also wonders about their child’s health since they’re family. Daenerys comforts Jon the Targaryens have been inbreeding for years and she’s perfectly healthy. Daenerys thinks she’s having a son again, and asks Jon what he would name their son. Jon thinks he should be named after the greatest person he knew in his life, the one that saved his life, his uncle Ned. He wants his son to be named Eddard Targaryen. Daenerys repeats the name and smiles.

She says she likes it very much. The two start to kiss in their hut. Jaime visits Brienne’s hut as well. Brienne grieves over Podrick’s death, telling him that Podrick was the least person to deserves to die like that. Jaime agrees telling Brienne that he was a good lad and he was lucky to have been around Brienne all that time.

• The Hound and Arya make a fire during the night. The Hound asks how she managed to cross off almost every name of her list, but before Arya can respond she tells the Hound to shut up. She hears some strange noises. Not much later, a group of wights attack Arya and the Hound. The two begin to fight the wights but more wights come since they’re attracted to the noise. It’s then when Nymeria and a much larger pack of wolves come in between and kill off a big bunch of Wights. A lot of wolves die too. When most of the Wights are killed off, The Hound thinks they should flee as soon as they can before another group of Wights comes to kill them off. Arya discovers that she has lost Needle during the fight, but the Hound insists that there’s no time left to search for the damned sword and that they should leave immediately. This time Arya manages to have Nymeria follow her and the Hound.

• The wedding between Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy takes place in the Throne Room. Euron looks very delighted, Cersei not so. It’s Qyburn who has them married. Cersei wears a tight, long black dress. She looks quite sad during the wedding. The wedding scene itself doesn’t take long and the scene switches to their wedding bed. This scene is an intercut between Cersei and Euron having sex and Jaime and Brienne also having sex in their hut. The two still think of each other.

• Next morning, the group departs from Greywater Watch and Jon and Sansa say goodbye to each other for the time being. Jon asks Gendry to keep his sister safe. Daenerys and Jon also say goodbye and leave each other. Daenerys tells Jon that Drogon should stay with him. They’ll need him to fight the Night King. The two kiss before leaving each other. Jorah is still having difficulties with that. We see all of the character go different ways and that’s how the episode ends.

• Died: a lot of Wights and wolves, Lyanna Mormont (off-screen)

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS MIGHT ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

EDIT: ORIGINALLY, HOWLAND DIED DURING EP.2 BUT THE WRITERS CHOSE TO INCLUDE GREYWATER WATCH LATER ON.

• The first scene will take place in King’s Landing. Cersei speaks with Qyburn, Euron and the three Commanders of the Golden Company. Qyburn informs them that Daenerys and Jon have been splitting up their army and that Jaime is currently with Jon and Edmure in Riverrun, probably awaiting an attack from the Night King. Pyke has been taken again by Theon Greyjoy and Jon’s army, which visibly angers Euron. Daenerys traveled back to Dragonstone. Cersei laughs and tells the rest she hopes the Night King devours their army soon enough. They shouldn’t wait too long and have the Golden Company attack Dragonstone since Daenerys’s army is reduced remarkably. Euron Greyjoy is watching the Iron Throne when Cersei joins him in the Throne Room. She asks Euron why he doesn’t attack Pyke, since his nephew has taken it from him. Euron initially thinks it’s a stupid idea to go North now, but Cersei convinces him to learn them another lesson. Euron decides to take his fleet and travels to Pyke.

• Cersei and Qyburn are watching from above how Euron leaves. Qyburn asks Cersei if it is smart to have their most important ally travel so far North at the moment. Cersei tells Qyburn she hopes her enemies deal with Euron Greyjoy and that he never returns to King’s Landing.

• Daenerys, Sam, Gilly, Varys and Missandei have returned to Dragonstone. Varys reports to Daenerys that Cersei has hired the Golden Company and that Euron’s ships has been seen leaving King’s Landing. They could attack her any moment, now that her forces are weakened. Daenerys agrees and hopes that Jon and co. finishes the Night King’s army as soon as possible. When Daenerys takes a bath, Missandei remarks that she’s visibly pregnant right by now. Daenerys asks Missandei how she deals with Grey Worm’s death, at which Missandei responds that she’s missing him every day. Missandei asks Daenerys whether she misses Jon. Daenerys says she does. Next scene is Samwell with Gilly and Little Sam. Samwell wants Gilly to travel to Horn Hill with Little Sam. They aren’t safe in Dragonstone with enemies from all sides. Gilly reminds Sam that he promised her not to leave them, but Sam insists that they must. They’ll be safe with his mother and sister. He promises that he’ll fight for them.

• Jaime, Jon, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah and Edmure are already in Riverrun. Jon mentions that the Army of the Dead has been seen reaching the Twins. They will be upon them soon and tells them they should take their armies to the Eyrie immediately. Tyrion takes the time to ask Jaime about Cersei and why he chosen to leave her. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei will never find peace after the deaths of their children and chose to betray everybody during the Dragonpit by hiring the Golden Company. Their relationship fully consumed him. Tyrion reminds the rest that Daenerys isn’t safe in Dragonstone, now that Cersei has an army of thousands of sellswords behind her back. She could attack Dragonstone any moment from now. Jorah think his place should be with his queen now as he promised to protect her at any cost. Jon seems to agree and lets him go.

Jon sends word to his sister, Sansa, to inform her that the Army of the Dead will reach the Vale soon and that their army is marching to the Vale now.

• Cersei stands with the commanders of the Golden Company on the giant map of Westeros. She instructs the commanders to take their men to Dragonstone with Euron’s remaining ships and to capture Daenerys Targaryen. She can’t wait to kill the foreign whore herself. The commanders leave and obey her orders.

• Sansa receives word from Jon Snow and orders the Lords of the Vale that they should prepare now. She convinces Robin Arryn to have Lord Royce lead the Knights of the Vale. Robin tells Sansa he intends to fight with them. Sansa answers Robin that it’s not a good idea and that he should be kept safe. Robin laughs and tells Sansa that he’s not a girl, unlike Sansa. Gendry and Sansa have a conversation as well. Sansa asks how Gendry came to meet Arya, but he tells Sansa that the story is too long to tell. The two seem to get well along and Sansa thanks him for fighting with them.

• Missandei receives a visitor in Dragonstone. She first asks after Jon Snow, but is happy to meet Daenerys as well. It seems to be old Melisandre who comes to bring them important news. Old Melisandre tells them that a great last sacrifice should be made if they want to win the war and that it requires true king’s blood. Old Melisandre points at Daenerys’s baby. Daenerys is furious at the old lady and sends her away immediately. Before Old Melisandre leaves, Varys talks with her outside. Melisandre makes her identity known, which has Varys shocked. She tells Varys that he should remember what the voice said in the flames. He should be the one to save the common people from the doom. She asks Varys to fulfill the prophecy and save Westeros. Varys can’t utter a word. Melisandre leaves Dragonstone and the series.

• The next shot takes place in Pyke. Theon Greyjoy is sitting on his father’s chair when his men come to tell him that Euron Greyjoy has arrived in Pyke as well. Euron speaks with Theon outside. He has Yara with him and tells Theon that he should give up Pyke already or he’ll slit his sister’s throat in front of him. Theon is starting to notice that it’s getting a lot colder and he can see his breath. He tells Euron that they are coming for them, but Euron doesn’t understand at first. Men start to scream and Wights start invading Pyke. Yara takes adventage of the moment and kicks Euron. Theon implores Yara to escape to Dragonstone. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he won’t fail her another time. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he won’t fail her another time. She escapes on a small ship with a few loyal men. Theon fights Euron himself. Ironborn and Northmen fight the wights, while Euron battles Theon. Euron gets the upper-hand and swings his axe Theon right in Theon’s body. Theon dies immediately, Euron laughs. Euron implores his men to leave Pyke with the boats. A lot of his men have died, but Euron manages to escape.

End episode 4

First outline season 8, episode 5

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

NOTE: DURATION TIME (=/- 100 min.)

• First scene will only include the soundtrack of R. Djawadi, there’s no dialogue in the first five minutes. We first see the Knights of the Vale preparing themselves for an attack. We get a shot of the Lannister, Tully and Stark army marching to the Vale. Jaime, Tyrion, Edmure and Bronn are seen leading their men. Then we see the Golden Company getting on board of Euron Greyjoy’s ships. The Knights of the Vale see a huge storm approaching slowly, Yohn Royce is commanding the Army of the Vale to keep their spears of dragonglass ready. Robin Arryn fights alongside Yohn Royce. Lord Royce isn’t too pleased to have Robin Arryn commanding their men. You can literally read that from his face.

• First line comes from Yohn Royce who commands his men to keep ready. Wights start to invade the Bloody Gate. Robin Arryn is commanding the archers, but fails miserably. Inside the Eyrie, we see Lady Sansa together with Gendry and Brienne of Tarth. Gendry says goodbye to Sansa and joins the fight. Sansa tells Gendry she hopes he’ll come back. Gendry expresses his doubt. Brienne of Tarth also wants to join the fight, but Sansa isn’t too fond of that idea. She wants Brienne to stay with her, but Brienne says she can’t save Sansa if the Wights invade inside the Eyrie as well. She swore to protect Sansa and the best way to do that is to keep the entry of the Vale safe from the Night King’s army. Sansa hugs Brienne and thanks her for everything she has done to protect her family. Brienne leaves to join the fight.

• Next scene takes place in Dragonstone. News reaches Dragonstone that the Golden Company is on their way to attack Queen Daenerys. Daenerys commands her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki to protect Dragonstone from invading there. Varys advises her to leave Dragonstone immediately, but Daenerys doesn’t listen to his counsel. She realizes that her water has broken and she’s ready to labor. Missandei and Samwell help Daenerys and make her rest right away. Samwell is worried because Daenerys’s baby is coming way to soon.

• Then we see three White Walkers from a distance watching how the Wights win from the Knights of the Vale. The Night King is flying on Viserion above the White Walkers, watching the spectacle as well. Viserion apparently has lost one of his eyes and his right wing got gravely injured. Brienne is fighting for her life. Robin Arryn is almost attacked by several Wights and runs away to hide inside of the Eyrie. Sansa confronts him that he promised to fight with his men, but Robin expresses his lack of interest in the survival of his men.

Brienne, Lord Royce and Gendry continue to fight but it looks like a losing side until now. The White Walkers now start to invade the Eyrie as well. A roaring Undead Dragon can be heard. A one blue-eyed Undead Viserion flies above Lord Royce and his men and sets them afire. Then we hear the roaring of another dragon. The Night King looks behind and sees Jon Snow on Drogon helping the Lord of Vale out. Beneath Jon Snow, we see the Tully, Lannister and Northern forces joining the fray. Lots of Wights are set afire by Drogon while the Westerosi armies slaughter them. It looks like the Dragonfire doesn’t affect the White Walkers, though. Bronn manages to kill of a White Walker with two spears of Dragonglass. Jaime sees that Brienne is getting in trouble with another White Walker. She gets stabbed right in the guts and that’s when Jaime goes mad and stabs the WW from behind. Brienne is dying and Jaime holds her in her arms. She asks Jaime to keep Sansa and Arya safe, as she promised that to Lady Catelyn. Jaime says he will do that for her. Brienne last words are that Jaime is a honorable man. She dies in his arms.

• Arya, the Hound and Nymeria are entering a snowy King’s Landing. The Hound remarks that he hasn’t missed the stinking city at all and Arya agrees. Arya notices that the city has changed a lot since she has left and walks past a destroyed Sept of Baelor. To be in the same place again reminds her of Ned Stark. She tells the Hound it’s time to pay the Lannisters their debts.

• Daenerys is starting to labor. It’s Samwell and Missandei who help her with it. Varys witnesses how a smaller part of the Golden Company is invading the shores of Dragonstone. The Unsullied try to stop them from entering the stairs to the castle. The Dothraki fight them on shore. Jorah and a small part of the Northern army join the fight as well. Jorah tries to get inside the castle to protect Daenerys.

• In the Eyrie, the army of the Undead is diminishing by the second. Edmure is leading his men very well; Tyrion does too. The Night King is no longer mounting Viserion and tries to get inside the Eyrie with another White Walker. Viserion tries to attack Gendry and opens his mouth to spit fire on him. Gendry mounts a spear of Dragonglass in the mouth of the dragon. Undead Viserion falls from the rocks of the bloody gate and it is Drogon who finishes the job and sets Viserion on fire.

• Jorah has made it into Dragonstone and finds Daenerys laboring. Things don’t look too bright for her. A sad Samwell concludes that both mother and child could never survive together and he only can save one of them. Jorah wants Daenerys to survive but Daenerys doesn’t want to give up on her baby. Samwell sets through and Daenerys manages to deliver her baby. Samwell tells Daenerys that she has delivered a girl and asks for her name. A very weakened Daenerys wants to name her baby Lyanna, as Jon would have liked that. Daenerys is dying and Missandei, Varys and Jorah realize that. The Golden Company is getting the upper-hand and start to invade the stairs to Dragonstone as well. Daenerys says goodbye to Jorah and thanks him for always being there for her. Jorah expresses his love for her and Daenerys asks Jorah to continue his oath and to keep her daughter safe for her together with Missandei. She asks Jorah to release her from her suffering and to kill her. Jorah says he never could and it’s Varys who puts Samwell’s sword, Heartsbane, through Daenerys’s chest.

• Cersei Lannister and the Mountain receive Qyburn in the Throne Room. He comes to tell her that Daenerys has been defeated. Cersei laughes and both drink to celebrate their victory. Cersei begins to feel dizzy and the audience realizes that it’s Arya with Qyburn’s face. She has poisoned Cersei with Jaqen’s vial. Qyburn starts to confront her and Cersei realizes that something is not right here. That’s when Arya makes her identity known. She tells Cersei that a lion should never have fought with a pack of wolves. Cersei begs The Mountain to kill off Arya but Arya tells her that won’t help. She brings in Nymeria and the Hound to finish the job. Nymeria gravely injures Cersei and the Hound combats with the Mountain. It’s Arya who finishes Cersei and slits her throat. Nymeria and the Hound destroys the Mountain but he doesn’t seem to die. The Mountain loses his helmet at some point and that’s when the Hound manages to burn his face with fire. The Mountain is left to die and The Hound, Arya and Nymeria leave The Red Keep.

• The Commanders of the Golden Company have entered the castle and order Varys to hand over Daenerys to them. Varys tell them that Daenerys has died and the Commanders clear Varys out of their way and stab him. They indeed find Daenerys’s body and take her body with them to bring it to Queen Cersei. Samwell is able to hide himself together with Missandei and Dany’s baby. The Golden Company retreat back to King’s Landing.

• Euron Greyjoy arrives back in King’s Landing to find out that Queen Cersei has been slaughtered. He pretends to be saddened by her death.

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark arrive back in Dragonstone to find out that everyone has been slaughtered. Samwell meets him on the stairs with Jon’s child in his arms. Jon starts to weep. He asks if Daenerys has made it, but Samwell is sad to tell him she has not. He tells him she named their daughter Lyanna Targaryen.

• The last scene of the episode is the coronation of King Euron I Greyjoy. He is made King of the Seven Kingdoms.

Deaths: Lord Royce, Brienne of Tarth, Robin Arryn, Undead Viserion, Queen Daenerys Targaryen, Night King, Qyburn (off-screen), Queen Cersei Lannister, The Mountain and Varys

[SPOILERS] S5E10 Meryn Trant's evilness is clumsily presented,"I didn't mind that Arya killed Meryn Trant in a brutal fashion. He had it coming and it serves Arya's character development that she should become more ""edgy"".

But the whole thing was ruined for me by the scene where Meryn is revealed to be a pedophile. I feel like it insults the audience's intelligence. We know Trant is a bad guy and, more importantly, that Arya hates him. He killed Syrio, he's slapped Sansa around, he serves the Lannisters. But they had to pull some random, and to be honest disproportionately ""bad guy"" stuff out of nowhere to remind us how bad he is. He may as well have walked onto the screen, recited some pages out of Main Kampf, cackled ""HAHAHA I HATE THE JEWS"", and then walked off. It was transparently, and clumsily, a set up for him to be killed by Arya the next episode.

Even if they wanted him to be a pedophile, they could have presented it in a much more graceful manner. Script rewrite. Arya scouts Meryn's daily trips to a bar. Arya follows Meryn to bar. Drunk Meryn catcalls the 14 year old Arya, who he does not recognize (there you go, pedo). Arya picks up on it, shows some shoulder or something and walks into alleyway. Excited Meryn follows and gets stabbed repeatedly in the eyeball. That would have been fine, everyone in character, and it would have been better for Arya's character development because then she wouldn't be killing someone who was painted so comically evil, she would be killing someone who was just normal human evil, which to me is so much more satisfying.

She has her dragon kill one of these men. Why? I don't understand her logic. She claims to be a bringer of justice to the innocent and such, and yet she kills a man who might have been innocent to send a message? I felt like that was out of character. Just before this episode, she found a Son of the Harpy and decided to give him a fair trial because she wasn't going to execute him without knowing if he was innocent. Then she cut off the head of the man who killed him unjustly. I don't understand why she'd kill a presumably innocent man who had nothing to do with Ser Barristan's death.

First outline season 8, episode 2

HBO LEAK

• The episode will have a duration of almost 2 hours.

• The first scene will take place in the Great Hall of Winterfell. Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, Davos and Sansa are present here. Gendry and Tormund tell the rest that the Wall has fallen and the Night Watch destroyed. Tormund also mentions that the Night King rides an undead dragon and that they are severely fucked. Bran Stark confirms Gendry and Tormund’s story and tells that the Night King is on his way to Winterfell. Jon Snow tells the rest that they have no time to lose and asks Maester Wolkan to inform all of their banners, everyone in the North, to prepare themselves for a war against the Army of the Dead. They need to prepare for an attack at the battlefield of Winterfell.

• After having to process a lot of new information and struggling with his identity, Jon Snow goes to the crypts to visit his mother, Lyanna and his uncle, Ned Stark. Daenerys notices that there’s something wrong with Jon and finds him in the crypts. She asks Jon what’s wrong with him. Jon tells her that he even isn’t called Jon Snow. He calls ‘Jon Snow’ a lie people have made him believe all of life. Daenerys is confused and asks Jon for clarification but Jon walks away from her. Daenerys notices that Jon behaves aloof toward her.

• Daenerys walks out of the crypts, which Jorah Mormont notices. He asks her what happened down them in the crypts but Daenerys answers that she doesn’t know what’s up with Jon. She tells Jorah that Jon is hiding something from her. Jorah also tells Daenerys that it striked him that Daenerys has been so absent for days. She answers that she’s not feeling very well lately. Jorah proposes to have her examined by Maester Wolkan.

• Qyburn enters Cersei’s chambers. He mentions that she hasn’t spoken about her miscarriage anymore and that she needs to take enough time to rest. Cersei answers that there’s no time for that and doesn’t want to say more about the miscarriage. Qyburn leaves her chambers, Cersei watches from her window, witnessing how the snow falls in King’s Landing. The next shot is Jaime, riding his horse in snowy conditions. He and Bronn arrive in Riverrun, both discover that the Tullys are once again laying siege to Riverrun. Jaime enters the stage and meets up with Edmure. Edmure tells Jaime he should have him in chains, but Jaime responds that he doesn’t come to argue about the damned castle. He proposes Edmure to help his niece and nephew in the Great War against the Night King. He also promises to give Edmure Riverrun back to the Tullys, since it doesn’t matter any longer who’s holding the castle at this point. Edmure tends to agree, not for Jaime but for his family.

• Most of House Stark’s bannermen and Daenerys’s army have now arrived in Winterfell. Among them is Howland Reed. He arrived with his army and Meera Reed by his side. Arya receives a visitor in Winterfell. He seems to be an ordinary bannerman from House Cerwyn, but he quickly removes his face. It seems to be Jaqen H’ghar. Arya is surprised to have Jaqen visiting her. Jaqen tells Arya the Many-Faced God requires another death, a name to be crossed off her list. He reveals it to be the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister. A price was paid. What better servant of the Many-Faced God than Arya Stark can kill Cersei Lannister. He gives a vial of poison to Arya and leaves her.

• Jon Snow seizes the moment to talk with Howland Reed alone. He asks Howland to confirm Bran’s story, but Howland doesn’t acknowledge this at all. Jon Snow pleads him to tell the truth since Robert Baratheon isn’t alive any longer, there’s no point in lying anymore. Howland ultimately confirms that Ned was carrying Lyanna’s child when he came out of the Tower of Joy. He always promised him to keep this a secret. Jon thanks him for telling the truth anyway.

• Knowing that the Army of the Undead will be upon them very soon, Tyrion, Jon, Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Podrick, Davos, Tormund, Gendry, Varys, Jorah, Theon, The Hound, Grey Worm and Sam discuss together with the Stark bannermen and Daenerys’s army how they will defend the North. Allegedly the Last Hearth has already been attacked by the White Walkers and their castle destroyed. Ned Umber didn’t make it out alive. Tyrion speaks for Daenerys, who’s absent due to illness. He comes forward with a plan to defend the North. Tormund, the remaining Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied will attack with dragonglass from the Dreadfort since that’s where they are heading to first. On their way to Winterfell, the dragons will set the army of the Dead afire and House Stark’s bannermen and the Knights of the Vale will fight weakened forces at the battlefield of Winterfell and hopefully destroy the Night King as well. Jon wants Brienne and Podrick to take Sansa and Arya and Bran with them and to leave with Robin Arryn to the Eyrie.

Arya doesn’t want to and claims that she’s stronger than most men. They need her in the war to come. Jon insists that he doesn’t want that. Jorah also wants to fight alongside House Mormont but Lyanna reminds him that he has betrayed his own House. Varys mentions that he has also received word from King’s Landing. Supposedly, Queen Cersei has bought a great army of sellswords and Euron Greyjoy has taken Storm’s End to install the army there. Theon pleads to have Storm’s End attacked and Gendry agrees since it’s the seat of his father’s house. Jon promises Theon that he will help to destroy Euron and save his sister after they have dealt with the Night King and his army. There’s no time for that now since all of their lives are in danger and they have no choice than to face the Night King and his army. He needs his help and that of the Iron Islanders as well during the battle at Winterfell. A disappointed Theon accepts his proposal.

• Missandei visits Daenerys in her chambers. Daenerys tells Missandei that Maester Wolkan examined her and that he confirmed that she’s pregnant. Missandei asks why she isn’t happy then. Daenerys feels that Jon has changed towards her and doesn’t understand why.

• The Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied prepare to leave Winterfell. Jon asks Daenerys why she didn’t attend this important gathering, but Daenerys doesn’t reply to that as well. Meera goes to say goodbye to Bran in the Godswood in Winterfell when Bran starts to behave very strangely. He pleads Meera to warn them since the Night King’s army is here. Jon is going to say goodbye to Sansa when Meera runs to warn the others. A huge winter storm starts to come closer to Winterfell. Chaos erupts. The North and Daenerys’s army gather outside to face the Night King’s army. Jon orders Sansa, Arya and Daenerys to stay inside Winterfell.

They are too valuable to lose and promises them that Winterfell will not fall. Varys, Tyrion, Robin, Samwell, Gilly, Lyanna and Missandei also remain inside Winterfell. Arya first doesn’t want to but obeys Jon’s wish. Sansa asks Meera to get Bran inside asap. A huge flock of wights invade the battlefield of Winterfell. Dothraki face the Army of the Dead first and many of them are taken out quite easily. Lots of wights keep coming. Ghost fights with Jon and saves him at one point from a wight trying to kill him. Ghost is killed off trying to save Jon. Inside Winterfell, Daenerys is frustrated that she’s not able to help and that she should fly Drogon to destroy the undead. Missandei answers that it’s not wise to join the fight while she’s pregnant. Sam tries to console Gilly and Little Sam. The news surprises Sansa, Tyrion and Varys. Drogon comes in between and takes out a big chunk of the Night King’s army but also kills some of the Northern bannermen in the process. The White Walkers also enters the stage with the Night King flying Undead Viserion above them. Viserion starts to destroy the Northern’s army as well. Lord Glover and Howland Reed die are killed by dragonfire. Tormund leads the Free Folk and fights but is killed by Drogon’s fire. Drogon also manages to kill an undead giant. Meera wants Bran to leave the Godswood but he tells her he has help and Jon and co. Bran is trying to control Rhaegal with his mind. Meera warns Bran that is too dangerous and that he should stay inside. Jon and Daenerys’s army is diminishing greatly since many wights keep coming. White Walkers try to invade Winterfell. Grey Worm faces two White Walkers and is able to take out one of them with his spear from Dragonglass. The other WW kills him. The White Walkers supposedly try to invade Winterfell to take down Bran.

Brienne guards the castle together with Podrick, Jorah and Gendry. Wights and White Walkers and Wights start to invade there as well. Podrick is killed off by a group of Wights, which makes Brienne go psycho and takes out one of the White Walkers as well with Oathkeeper. Meera is urging Bran to give up and get inside but Bran doesn’t want to. He wants Meera to leave instead and get safe inside the castle. Meera answers that she will stay together with him until the end. Jaime Lannister and the Tully forces come to the North’s aid right in time. Bran is managing to warg inside Rhaegal and the dragon starts to fight undead Viserion, trying to bite him right in the neck but gets gravely injured during the fight as well. Rhaegal starts to breathe fire on Viserion, which seems to make the Night King start leaving the battlefield on injured Viserion’s back.

• Meera realizes that this is the end for them. White Walkers are coming for Bran and she gets killed off by the White Walkers while defending Bran’s body. Viserion and Rhaegal keep fighting each other and both start to be seriously injured. It seems like dragonfire can harm the Night King. The White Walkers stab Bran to death, which makes Rhaegal fall to the ground and to be stabbed to death by Wights. The Night King’s army of Undead is starting to diminish. We see Jaime commanding his men and fighting the remaining Undead alongside Bronn. Jon fights alongside the Hound and Davos. The Hound is fighting like a boss right here. When Jon starts to notice that the Night King’s army is retreating as well he commands everybody to leave the battlefield asap and goes with Davos and the Hound to get everyone safely outside now. The Knights of the Vale, Sansa, Brienne and Robin leave together to the Eyrie. Arya, The Hound, Jaime Lannister, Bronn, Edmure Tully, Tully and Lannister forces retreat to Riverrun. Jon, Davos, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Samwell, Gilly, Little Sam, Theon, the remaining Unsullied and Dothraki forces travel south. Lyanna Mormont and her men retreat to Bear Island.

• The last shot we see is Jon and Daenerys on Drogon’s back setting all the dead afire including dead Rhaegal. Both sides suffered great losses in this fight.

• Deaths: Grey Worm, Tormund, Podrick, Meera, Bran, Rhaegal, Robett Glover, Howland Reed

HBO LEAK

• Note that this episode is a bit shorter than the others and has a duration of +/- 60 minutes.

• Jon, Daenerys, Sansa, Robin, Lord Royce, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Varys, Brienne, Tyrion, Jorah, Gendry, Sam, Gilly, Davos, Missandei, Little Sam and Theon all arrive in Greywater Watch. Not all of these characters appear on screen though. They make a stop to rest there and to discuss their strategy to defeat the Night King for good.

• Inside Greywater Watch, Daenerys, Jon, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Tyrion, Sansa, Sam, Davos, Robin and Lord Royce discuss how they will organize themselves before splitting up. Jon proposes to await the Night King’s attack from the Eyrie since the fortress is very difficult to impregnate. Tyrion jokes that the Night King only needs 10 good men to impregnate the bitch, but only Bronn catches the joke. The remaining Lannister and Tully army defend Riverrun together with Edmure, Tyrion, Jaime and Bronn. When the Eyrie gets attacked first, the Night King’s army has to get lured into the Bloody Gate and that’s when the Lannister and Tully forces need to join the attack as well. Theon has to take back Pyke and defend it together with the remaining army of the North and the Ironborn. Jon remarks that Arya and The Hound have not been seen arriving in Greywater Watch. Edmures assures that Arya hasn’t died but simply disappeared when they were retreating from Winterfell. Sansa remarks that she’d be safe with the Hound. She always manages to survive somehow. Jon also wants Sansa and Brienne to join Robin and Gendry to the Eyrie where they’d probably be safer than now. Jon stays with Davos, Jaime, Jorah, Bronn, Tyrion and Edmure in Riverrun. Jon wants Daenerys, to travel to Dragonstone together with Varys and Missandei. Sam and Gilly should travel with her.

Maester Wolkan received bad news, though. Lyanna Mormont didn’t make it to Bear Island and died.

• Next shot is Arya and the Hound travelling on the Kingsroad. The Hound complains to Arya that she should have followed her brother and sister and that she’s a stupid girl to travel alone in the North now that the army of undead fuckers are around. Arya answers the Hound that he shouldn’t have sticked with her if he’s scared. The Hound deduces that Arya is traveling to King’s Landing, but he doesn’t understand why. Arya says that she has to cross one last name off her list. The Hound laughs and tells Arya why she’s still holding that fucking list since everyone will die soon anyway. Arya responds that she needs to kill Cersei herself. The Hound agrees and tells that he has some unfinished business with his brother as well. The two encounter by an old woman, who’s asking after the King in The North. The Hound says that an old woman shouldn’t be alone in the woods with the army of the Night King approaching. The old woman says she doesn’t fear the dead. Arya tells the woman she thinks Jon Snow has traveled south, probably to Dragonstone. The old woman takes a look at Arya and tells her that they have met before. Arya is puzzled about this, the Old Woman leaves.

• During the night, the characters at Greywater Watch sleep in huts. Jon chats a last time with Howland Reed, asking if he joins them to the South since the White Walkers would probably hit Greywater Watch soon. Howland Reed tells that he’s ready to die. He doesn’t care of his life anymore, now with his children being passed away. He tells Jon Snow the Walkers can have him. He tells Jon he also needs to pay for his sins, for killing Arthur Dayne behind his back. He tells Jon the story of how he saw Ned Stark with baby Jon in his arms.

His uncle always wanted to keep him safe, even willing to sacrifice his life for Jon. Howland tells Jon he recognizes a lot of traits of Ned in Jon Snow and says that he would make a good ruler on the Iron Throne. Jon insists that he isn’t interested in that and leaves Howland Reed.

• Then, we see Cersei in King’s Landing. Qyburn visits the chamber of the Hand and informs Cersei that Winterfell has been attacked and that Daenerys and Jon have lost a great deal of their army. Cersei smiles. Qyburn also tells that the Lannister army has joined the Battle at Winterfell apperently. Cersei asks if Jaime has survived, but Qyburn tells he doesn’t know. Cersei answers that he shouldn’t have. After that, Euron arrives back in King’s Landing. He comes to tell Cersei that the Golden Company succefully took Storm’s End and that the army is gathered right there. He tells Cersei he finally wants to receive his reward and they shouldn’t wait to marry and be husband and wife tonight. Cersei reluctantly agrees.

• It’s still night in Greywater Watch and the characters stay there until morning. Jon and Daenerys sleep together in a hut. Daenerys finally tells Jon that she’s pregnant with his child. Jon is surprised and expresses his happiness toward Daenerys. He jokes that this is the only good thing that happened to them at the moment. He also wonders about their child’s health since they’re family. Daenerys comforts Jon the Targaryens have been inbreeding for years and she’s perfectly healthy. Daenerys thinks she’s having a son again, and asks Jon what he would name their son. Jon thinks he should be named after the greatest person he knew in his life, the one that saved his life, his uncle Ned. He wants his son to be named Eddard Targaryen. Daenerys repeats the name and smiles.

She says she likes it very much. The two start to kiss in their hut. Jaime visits Brienne’s hut as well. Brienne grieves over Podrick’s death, telling him that Podrick was the least person to deserves to die like that. Jaime agrees telling Brienne that he was a good lad and he was lucky to have been around Brienne all that time.

• The Hound and Arya make a fire during the night. The Hound asks how she managed to cross off almost every name of her list, but before Arya can respond she tells the Hound to shut up. She hears some strange noises. Not much later, a group of wights attack Arya and the Hound. The two begin to fight the wights but more wights come since they’re attracted to the noise. It’s then when Nymeria and a much larger pack of wolves come in between and kill off a big bunch of Wights. A lot of wolves die too. When most of the Wights are killed off, The Hound thinks they should flee as soon as they can before another group of Wights comes to kill them off. Arya discovers that she has lost Needle during the fight, but the Hound insists that there’s no time left to search for the damned sword and that they should leave immediately. This time Arya manages to have Nymeria follow her and the Hound.

• The wedding between Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy takes place in the Throne Room. Euron looks very delighted, Cersei not so. It’s Qyburn who has them married. Cersei wears a tight, long black dress. She looks quite sad during the wedding. The wedding scene itself doesn’t take long and the scene switches to their wedding bed. This scene is an intercut between Cersei and Euron having sex and Jaime and Brienne also having sex in their hut. The two still think of each other.

• Next morning, the group departs from Greywater Watch and Jon and Sansa say goodbye to each other for the time being. Jon asks Gendry to keep his sister safe. Daenerys and Jon also say goodbye and leave each other. Daenerys tells Jon that Drogon should stay with him. They’ll need him to fight the Night King. The two kiss before leaving each other. Jorah is still having difficulties with that. We see all of the character go different ways and that’s how the episode ends.

• Died: a lot of Wights and wolves, Lyanna Mormont (off-screen)

End Episode 3

First outline season 8, episode 4

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS MIGHT ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

EDIT: ORIGINALLY, HOWLAND DIED DURING EP.2 BUT THE WRITERS CHOSE TO INCLUDE GREYWATER WATCH LATER ON.

• The first scene will take place in King’s Landing. Cersei speaks with Qyburn, Euron and the three Commanders of the Golden Company. Qyburn informs them that Daenerys and Jon have been splitting up their army and that Jaime is currently with Jon and Edmure in Riverrun, probably awaiting an attack from the Night King. Pyke has been taken again by Theon Greyjoy and Jon’s army, which visibly angers Euron. Daenerys traveled back to Dragonstone. Cersei laughs and tells the rest she hopes the Night King devours their army soon enough. They shouldn’t wait too long and have the Golden Company attack Dragonstone since Daenerys’s army is reduced remarkably. Euron Greyjoy is watching the Iron Throne when Cersei joins him in the Throne Room. She asks Euron why he doesn’t attack Pyke, since his nephew has taken it from him. Euron initially thinks it’s a stupid idea to go North now, but Cersei convinces him to learn them another lesson. Euron decides to take his fleet and travels to Pyke.

• Cersei and Qyburn are watching from above how Euron leaves. Qyburn asks Cersei if it is smart to have their most important ally travel so far North at the moment. Cersei tells Qyburn she hopes her enemies deal with Euron Greyjoy and that he never returns to King’s Landing.

• Daenerys, Sam, Gilly, Varys and Missandei have returned to Dragonstone. Varys reports to Daenerys that Cersei has hired the Golden Company and that Euron’s ships has been seen leaving King’s Landing. They could attack her any moment, now that her forces are weakened. Daenerys agrees and hopes that Jon and co. finishes the Night King’s army as soon as possible. When Daenerys takes a bath, Missandei remarks that she’s visibly pregnant right by now. Daenerys asks Missandei how she deals with Grey Worm’s death, at which Missandei responds that she’s missing him every day. Missandei asks Daenerys whether she misses Jon. Daenerys says she does. Next scene is Samwell with Gilly and Little Sam. Samwell wants Gilly to travel to Horn Hill with Little Sam. They aren’t safe in Dragonstone with enemies from all sides. Gilly reminds Sam that he promised her not to leave them, but Sam insists that they must. They’ll be safe with his mother and sister. He promises that he’ll fight for them.

• Jaime, Jon, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah and Edmure are already in Riverrun. Jon mentions that the Army of the Dead has been seen reaching the Twins. They will be upon them soon and tells them they should take their armies to the Eyrie immediately. Tyrion takes the time to ask Jaime about Cersei and why he chosen to leave her. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei will never find peace after the deaths of their children and chose to betray everybody during the Dragonpit by hiring the Golden Company. Their relationship fully consumed him. Tyrion reminds the rest that Daenerys isn’t safe in Dragonstone, now that Cersei has an army of thousands of sellswords behind her back. She could attack Dragonstone any moment from now. Jorah think his place should be with his queen now as he promised to protect her at any cost. Jon seems to agree and lets him go.

Jon sends word to his sister, Sansa, to inform her that the Army of the Dead will reach the Vale soon and that their army is marching to the Vale now.

• Cersei stands with the commanders of the Golden Company on the giant map of Westeros. She instructs the commanders to take their men to Dragonstone with Euron’s remaining ships and to capture Daenerys Targaryen. She can’t wait to kill the foreign whore herself. The commanders leave and obey her orders.

• Sansa receives word from Jon Snow and orders the Lords of the Vale that they should prepare now. She convinces Robin Arryn to have Lord Royce lead the Knights of the Vale. Robin tells Sansa he intends to fight with them. Sansa answers Robin that it’s not a good idea and that he should be kept safe. Robin laughs and tells Sansa that he’s not a girl, unlike Sansa. Gendry and Sansa have a conversation as well. Sansa asks how Gendry came to meet Arya, but he tells Sansa that the story is too long to tell. The two seem to get well along and Sansa thanks him for fighting with them.

• Missandei receives a visitor in Dragonstone. She first asks after Jon Snow, but is happy to meet Daenerys as well. It seems to be old Melisandre who comes to bring them important news. Old Melisandre tells them that a great last sacrifice should be made if they want to win the war and that it requires true king’s blood. Old Melisandre points at Daenerys’s baby. Daenerys is furious at the old lady and sends her away immediately. Before Old Melisandre leaves, Varys talks with her outside. Melisandre makes her identity known, which has Varys shocked. She tells Varys that he should remember what the voice said in the flames. He should be the one to save the common people from the doom. She asks Varys to fulfill the prophecy and save Westeros. Varys can’t utter a word. Melisandre leaves Dragonstone and the series.

• The next shot takes place in Pyke. Theon Greyjoy is sitting on his father’s chair when his men come to tell him that Euron Greyjoy has arrived in Pyke as well. Euron speaks with Theon outside. He has Yara with him and tells Theon that he should give up Pyke already or he’ll slit his sister’s throat in front of him. Theon is starting to notice that it’s getting a lot colder and he can see his breath. He tells Euron that they are coming for them, but Euron doesn’t understand at first. Men start to scream and Wights start invading Pyke. Yara takes adventage of the moment and kicks Euron. Theon implores Yara to escape to Dragonstone. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he won’t fail her another time. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he won’t fail her another time. She escapes on a small ship with a few loyal men. Theon fights Euron himself. Ironborn and Northmen fight the wights, while Euron battles Theon. Euron gets the upper-hand and swings his axe Theon right in Theon’s body. Theon dies immediately, Euron laughs. Euron implores his men to leave Pyke with the boats. A lot of his men have died, but Euron manages to escape.

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

NOTE: DURATION TIME (=/- 100 min.)

• First scene will only include the soundtrack of R. Djawadi, there’s no dialogue in the first five minutes. We first see the Knights of the Vale preparing themselves for an attack. We get a shot of the Lannister, Tully and Stark army marching to the Vale. Jaime, Tyrion, Edmure and Bronn are seen leading their men. Then we see the Golden Company getting on board of Euron Greyjoy’s ships. The Knights of the Vale see a huge storm approaching slowly, Yohn Royce is commanding the Army of the Vale to keep their spears of dragonglass ready. Robin Arryn fights alongside Yohn Royce. Lord Royce isn’t too pleased to have Robin Arryn commanding their men. You can literally read that from his face.

• First line comes from Yohn Royce who commands his men to keep ready. Wights start to invade the Bloody Gate. Robin Arryn is commanding the archers, but fails miserably. Inside the Eyrie, we see Lady Sansa together with Gendry and Brienne of Tarth. Gendry says goodbye to Sansa and joins the fight. Sansa tells Gendry she hopes he’ll come back. Gendry expresses his doubt. Brienne of Tarth also wants to join the fight, but Sansa isn’t too fond of that idea. She wants Brienne to stay with her, but Brienne says she can’t save Sansa if the Wights invade inside the Eyrie as well. She swore to protect Sansa and the best way to do that is to keep the entry of the Vale safe from the Night King’s army. Sansa hugs Brienne and thanks her for everything she has done to protect her family. Brienne leaves to join the fight.

• Next scene takes place in Dragonstone. News reaches Dragonstone that the Golden Company is on their way to attack Queen Daenerys. Daenerys commands her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki to protect Dragonstone from invading there. Varys advises her to leave Dragonstone immediately, but Daenerys doesn’t listen to his counsel. She realizes that her water has broken and she’s ready to labor. Missandei and Samwell help Daenerys and make her rest right away. Samwell is worried because Daenerys’s baby is coming way to soon.

• Then we see three White Walkers from a distance watching how the Wights win from the Knights of the Vale. The Night King is flying on Viserion above the White Walkers, watching the spectacle as well. Viserion apparently has lost one of his eyes and his right wing got gravely injured. Brienne is fighting for her life. Robin Arryn is almost attacked by several Wights and runs away to hide inside of the Eyrie. Sansa confronts him that he promised to fight with his men, but Robin expresses his lack of interest in the survival of his men.

Brienne, Lord Royce and Gendry continue to fight but it looks like a losing side until now. The White Walkers now start to invade the Eyrie as well. A roaring Undead Dragon can be heard. A one blue-eyed Undead Viserion flies above Lord Royce and his men and sets them afire. Then we hear the roaring of another dragon. The Night King looks behind and sees Jon Snow on Drogon helping the Lord of Vale out. Beneath Jon Snow, we see the Tully, Lannister and Northern forces joining the fray. Lots of Wights are set afire by Drogon while the Westerosi armies slaughter them. It looks like the Dragonfire doesn’t affect the White Walkers, though. Bronn manages to kill of a White Walker with two spears of Dragonglass. Jaime sees that Brienne is getting in trouble with another White Walker. She gets stabbed right in the guts and that’s when Jaime goes mad and stabs the WW from behind. Brienne is dying and Jaime holds her in her arms. She asks Jaime to keep Sansa and Arya safe, as she promised that to Lady Catelyn. Jaime says he will do that for her. Brienne last words are that Jaime is a honorable man. She dies in his arms.

• Arya, the Hound and Nymeria are entering a snowy King’s Landing. The Hound remarks that he hasn’t missed the stinking city at all and Arya agrees. Arya notices that the city has changed a lot since she has left and walks past a destroyed Sept of Baelor. To be in the same place again reminds her of Ned Stark. She tells the Hound it’s time to pay the Lannisters their debts.

• Daenerys is starting to labor. It’s Samwell and Missandei who help her with it. Varys witnesses how a smaller part of the Golden Company is invading the shores of Dragonstone. The Unsullied try to stop them from entering the stairs to the castle. The Dothraki fight them on shore. Jorah and a small part of the Northern army join the fight as well. Jorah tries to get inside the castle to protect Daenerys.

• In the Eyrie, the army of the Undead is diminishing by the second. Edmure is leading his men very well; Tyrion does too. The Night King is no longer mounting Viserion and tries to get inside the Eyrie with another White Walker. Viserion tries to attack Gendry and opens his mouth to spit fire on him. Gendry mounts a spear of Dragonglass in the mouth of the dragon. Undead Viserion falls from the rocks of the bloody gate and it is Drogon who finishes the job and sets Viserion on fire.

• Jorah has made it into Dragonstone and finds Daenerys laboring. Things don’t look too bright for her. A sad Samwell concludes that both mother and child could never survive together and he only can save one of them. Jorah wants Daenerys to survive but Daenerys doesn’t want to give up on her baby. Samwell sets through and Daenerys manages to deliver her baby. Samwell tells Daenerys that she has delivered a girl and asks for her name. A very weakened Daenerys wants to name her baby Lyanna, as Jon would have liked that. Daenerys is dying and Missandei, Varys and Jorah realize that. The Golden Company is getting the upper-hand and start to invade the stairs to Dragonstone as well. Daenerys says goodbye to Jorah and thanks him for always being there for her. Jorah expresses his love for her and Daenerys asks Jorah to continue his oath and to keep her daughter safe for her together with Missandei. She asks Jorah to release her from her suffering and to kill her. Jorah says he never could and it’s Varys who puts Samwell’s sword, Heartsbane, through Daenerys’s chest.

• Cersei Lannister and the Mountain receive Qyburn in the Throne Room. He comes to tell her that Daenerys has been defeated. Cersei laughes and both drink to celebrate their victory. Cersei begins to feel dizzy and the audience realizes that it’s Arya with Qyburn’s face. She has poisoned Cersei with Jaqen’s vial. Qyburn starts to confront her and Cersei realizes that something is not right here. That’s when Arya makes her identity known. She tells Cersei that a lion should never have fought with a pack of wolves. Cersei begs The Mountain to kill off Arya but Arya tells her that won’t help. She brings in Nymeria and the Hound to finish the job. Nymeria gravely injures Cersei and the Hound combats with the Mountain. It’s Arya who finishes Cersei and slits her throat. Nymeria and the Hound destroys the Mountain but he doesn’t seem to die. The Mountain loses his helmet at some point and that’s when the Hound manages to burn his face with fire. The Mountain is left to die and The Hound, Arya and Nymeria leave The Red Keep.

• The Commanders of the Golden Company have entered the castle and order Varys to hand over Daenerys to them. Varys tell them that Daenerys has died and the Commanders clear Varys out of their way and stab him. They indeed find Daenerys’s body and take her body with them to bring it to Queen Cersei. Samwell is able to hide himself together with Missandei and Dany’s baby. The Golden Company retreat back to King’s Landing.

• Euron Greyjoy arrives back in King’s Landing to find out that Queen Cersei has been slaughtered. He pretends to be saddened by her death.

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark arrive back in Dragonstone to find out that everyone has been slaughtered. Samwell meets him on the stairs with Jon’s child in his arms. Jon starts to weep.

HBO LEAK

• The episode will have a duration of almost 2 hours.

• The first scene will take place in the Great Hall of Winterfell. Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, Davos and Sansa are present here. Gendry and Tormund tell the rest that the Wall has fallen and the Night Watch destroyed. Tormund also mentions that the Night King rides an undead dragon and that they are severely fucked. Bran Stark confirms Gendry and Tormund’s story and tells that the Night King is on his way to Winterfell. Jon Snow tells the rest that they have no time to lose and asks Maester Wolkan to inform all of their banners, everyone in the North, to prepare themselves for a war against the Army of the Dead. They need to prepare for an attack at the battlefield of Winterfell.

• After having to process a lot of new information and struggling with his identity, Jon Snow goes to the crypts to visit his mother, Lyanna and his uncle, Ned Stark. Daenerys notices that there’s something wrong with Jon and finds him in the crypts. She asks Jon what’s wrong with him. Jon tells her that he even isn’t called Jon Snow. He calls ‘Jon Snow’ a lie people have made him believe all of life. Daenerys is confused and asks Jon for clarification but Jon walks away from her. Daenerys notices that Jon behaves aloof toward her.

• Daenerys walks out of the crypts, which Jorah Mormont notices. He asks her what happened down them in the crypts but Daenerys answers that she doesn’t know what’s up with Jon. She tells Jorah that Jon is hiding something from her. Jorah also tells Daenerys that it striked him that Daenerys has been so absent for days. She answers that she’s not feeling very well lately. Jorah proposes to have her examined by Maester Wolkan.

• Qyburn enters Cersei’s chambers. He mentions that she hasn’t spoken about her miscarriage anymore and that she needs to take enough time to rest. Cersei answers that there’s no time for that and doesn’t want to say more about the miscarriage. Qyburn leaves her chambers, Cersei watches from her window, witnessing how the snow falls in King’s Landing. The next shot is Jaime, riding his horse in snowy conditions. He and Bronn arrive in Riverrun, both discover that the Tullys are once again laying siege to Riverrun. Jaime enters the stage and meets up with Edmure. Edmure tells Jaime he should have him in chains, but Jaime responds that he doesn’t come to argue about the damned castle. He proposes Edmure to help his niece and nephew in the Great War against the Night King. He also promises to give Edmure Riverrun back to the Tullys, since it doesn’t matter any longer who’s holding the castle at this point. Edmure tends to agree, not for Jaime but for his family.

• Most of House Stark’s bannermen and Daenerys’s army have now arrived in Winterfell. Among them is Howland Reed. He arrived with his army and Meera Reed by his side. Arya receives a visitor in Winterfell. He seems to be an ordinary bannerman from House Cerwyn, but he quickly removes his face. It seems to be Jaqen H’ghar. Arya is surprised to have Jaqen visiting her. Jaqen tells Arya the Many-Faced God requires another death, a name to be crossed off her list. He reveals it to be the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister. A price was paid. What better servant of the Many-Faced God than Arya Stark can kill Cersei Lannister. He gives a vial of poison to Arya and leaves her.

• Jon Snow seizes the moment to talk with Howland Reed alone. He asks Howland to confirm Bran’s story, but Howland doesn’t acknowledge this at all. Jon Snow pleads him to tell the truth since Robert Baratheon isn’t alive any longer, there’s no point in lying anymore. Howland ultimately confirms that Ned was carrying Lyanna’s child when he came out of the Tower of Joy. He always promised him to keep this a secret. Jon thanks him for telling the truth anyway.

• Knowing that the Army of the Undead will be upon them very soon, Tyrion, Jon, Sansa, Arya, Brienne, Podrick, Davos, Tormund, Gendry, Varys, Jorah, Theon, The Hound, Grey Worm and Sam discuss together with the Stark bannermen and Daenerys’s army how they will defend the North. Allegedly the Last Hearth has already been attacked by the White Walkers and their castle destroyed. Ned Umber didn’t make it out alive. Tyrion speaks for Daenerys, who’s absent due to illness. He comes forward with a plan to defend the North. Tormund, the remaining Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied will attack with dragonglass from the Dreadfort since that’s where they are heading to first. On their way to Winterfell, the dragons will set the army of the Dead afire and House Stark’s bannermen and the Knights of the Vale will fight weakened forces at the battlefield of Winterfell and hopefully destroy the Night King as well. Jon wants Brienne and Podrick to take Sansa and Arya and Bran with them and to leave with Robin Arryn to the Eyrie.

Arya doesn’t want to and claims that she’s stronger than most men. They need her in the war to come. Jon insists that he doesn’t want that. Jorah also wants to fight alongside House Mormont but Lyanna reminds him that he has betrayed his own House. Varys mentions that he has also received word from King’s Landing. Supposedly, Queen Cersei has bought a great army of sellswords and Euron Greyjoy has taken Storm’s End to install the army there. Theon pleads to have Storm’s End attacked and Gendry agrees since it’s the seat of his father’s house. Jon promises Theon that he will help to destroy Euron and save his sister after they have dealt with the Night King and his army. There’s no time for that now since all of their lives are in danger and they have no choice than to face the Night King and his army. He needs his help and that of the Iron Islanders as well during the battle at Winterfell. A disappointed Theon accepts his proposal.

• Missandei visits Daenerys in her chambers. Daenerys tells Missandei that Maester Wolkan examined her and that he confirmed that she’s pregnant. Missandei asks why she isn’t happy then. Daenerys feels that Jon has changed towards her and doesn’t understand why.

• The Free Folk, the Dothraki, the Unsullied prepare to leave Winterfell. Jon asks Daenerys why she didn’t attend this important gathering, but Daenerys doesn’t reply to that as well. Meera goes to say goodbye to Bran in the Godswood in Winterfell when Bran starts to behave very strangely. He pleads Meera to warn them since the Night King’s army is here. Jon is going to say goodbye to Sansa when Meera runs to warn the others. A huge winter storm starts to come closer to Winterfell. Chaos erupts. The North and Daenerys’s army gather outside to face the Night King’s army. Jon orders Sansa, Arya and Daenerys to stay inside Winterfell.

They are too valuable to lose and promises them that Winterfell will not fall. Varys, Tyrion, Robin, Samwell, Gilly, Lyanna and Missandei also remain inside Winterfell. Arya first doesn’t want to but obeys Jon’s wish. Sansa asks Meera to get Bran inside asap. A huge flock of wights invade the battlefield of Winterfell. Dothraki face the Army of the Dead first and many of them are taken out quite easily. Lots of wights keep coming. Ghost fights with Jon and saves him at one point from a wight trying to kill him. Ghost is killed off trying to save Jon. Inside Winterfell, Daenerys is frustrated that she’s not able to help and that she should fly Drogon to destroy the undead. Missandei answers that it’s not wise to join the fight while she’s pregnant. Sam tries to console Gilly and Little Sam. The news surprises Sansa, Tyrion and Varys. Drogon comes in between and takes out a big chunk of the Night King’s army but also kills some of the Northern bannermen in the process. The White Walkers also enters the stage with the Night King flying Undead Viserion above them. Viserion starts to destroy the Northern’s army as well. Lord Glover and Howland Reed die are killed by dragonfire. Tormund leads the Free Folk and fights but is killed by Drogon’s fire. Drogon also manages to kill an undead giant. Meera wants Bran to leave the Godswood but he tells her he has help and Jon and co. Bran is trying to control Rhaegal with his mind. Meera warns Bran that is too dangerous and that he should stay inside. Jon and Daenerys’s army is diminishing greatly since many wights keep coming. White Walkers try to invade Winterfell. Grey Worm faces two White Walkers and is able to take out one of them with his spear from Dragonglass. The other WW kills him. The White Walkers supposedly try to invade Winterfell to take down Bran.

Brienne guards the castle together with Podrick, Jorah and Gendry. Wights and White Walkers and Wights start to invade there as well. Podrick is killed off by a group of Wights, which makes Brienne go psycho and takes out one of the White Walkers as well with Oathkeeper. Meera is urging Bran to give up and get inside but Bran doesn’t want to. He wants Meera to leave instead and get safe inside the castle. Meera answers that she will stay together with him until the end. Jaime Lannister and the Tully forces come to the North’s aid right in time. Bran is managing to warg inside Rhaegal and the dragon starts to fight undead Viserion, trying to bite him right in the neck but gets gravely injured during the fight as well. Rhaegal starts to breathe fire on Viserion, which seems to make the Night King start leaving the battlefield on injured Viserion’s back.

• Meera realizes that this is the end for them. White Walkers are coming for Bran and she gets killed off by the White Walkers while defending Bran’s body. Viserion and Rhaegal keep fighting each other and both start to be seriously injured. It seems like dragonfire can harm the Night King. The White Walkers stab Bran to death, which makes Rhaegal fall to the ground and to be stabbed to death by Wights. The Night King’s army of Undead is starting to diminish. We see Jaime commanding his men and fighting the remaining Undead alongside Bronn. Jon fights alongside the Hound and Davos. The Hound is fighting like a boss right here. When Jon starts to notice that the Night King’s army is retreating as well he commands everybody to leave the battlefield asap and goes with Davos and the Hound to get everyone safely outside now. The Knights of the Vale, Sansa, Brienne and Robin leave together to the Eyrie. Arya, The Hound, Jaime Lannister, Bronn, Edmure Tully, Tully and Lannister forces retreat to Riverrun. Jon, Davos, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Samwell, Gilly, Little Sam, Theon, the remaining Unsullied and Dothraki forces travel south. Lyanna Mormont and her men retreat to Bear Island.

• The last shot we see is Jon and Daenerys on Drogon’s back setting all the dead afire including dead Rhaegal. Both sides suffered great losses in this fight.

• Deaths: Grey Worm, Tormund, Podrick, Meera, Bran, Rhaegal, Robett Glover, Howland Reed

HBO LEAK

• Note that this episode is a bit shorter than the others and has a duration of +/- 60 minutes.

• Jon, Daenerys, Sansa, Robin, Lord Royce, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Varys, Brienne, Tyrion, Jorah, Gendry, Sam, Gilly, Davos, Missandei, Little Sam and Theon all arrive in Greywater Watch. Not all of these characters appear on screen though. They make a stop to rest there and to discuss their strategy to defeat the Night King for good.

• Inside Greywater Watch, Daenerys, Jon, Jaime, Bronn, Edmure, Tyrion, Sansa, Sam, Davos, Robin and Lord Royce discuss how they will organize themselves before splitting up. Jon proposes to await the Night King’s attack from the Eyrie since the fortress is very difficult to impregnate. Tyrion jokes that the Night King only needs 10 good men to impregnate the bitch, but only Bronn catches the joke. The remaining Lannister and Tully army defend Riverrun together with Edmure, Tyrion, Jaime and Bronn. When the Eyrie gets attacked first, the Night King’s army has to get lured into the Bloody Gate and that’s when the Lannister and Tully forces need to join the attack as well. Theon has to take back Pyke and defend it together with the remaining army of the North and the Ironborn. Jon remarks that Arya and The Hound have not been seen arriving in Greywater Watch. Edmures assures that Arya hasn’t died but simply disappeared when they were retreating from Winterfell. Sansa remarks that she’d be safe with the Hound. She always manages to survive somehow. Jon also wants Sansa and Brienne to join Robin and Gendry to the Eyrie where they’d probably be safer than now. Jon stays with Davos, Jaime, Jorah, Bronn, Tyrion and Edmure in Riverrun. Jon wants Daenerys, to travel to Dragonstone together with Varys and Missandei. Sam and Gilly should travel with her.

Maester Wolkan received bad news, though. Lyanna Mormont didn’t make it to Bear Island and died.

• Next shot is Arya and the Hound travelling on the Kingsroad. The Hound complains to Arya that she should have followed her brother and sister and that she’s a stupid girl to travel alone in the North now that the army of undead fuckers are around. Arya answers the Hound that he shouldn’t have sticked with her if he’s scared. The Hound deduces that Arya is traveling to King’s Landing, but he doesn’t understand why. Arya says that she has to cross one last name off her list. The Hound laughs and tells Arya why she’s still holding that fucking list since everyone will die soon anyway. Arya responds that she needs to kill Cersei herself. The Hound agrees and tells that he has some unfinished business with his brother as well. The two encounter by an old woman, who’s asking after the King in The North. The Hound says that an old woman shouldn’t be alone in the woods with the army of the Night King approaching. The old woman says she doesn’t fear the dead. Arya tells the woman she thinks Jon Snow has traveled south, probably to Dragonstone. The old woman takes a look at Arya and tells her that they have met before. Arya is puzzled about this, the Old Woman leaves.

• During the night, the characters at Greywater Watch sleep in huts. Jon chats a last time with Howland Reed, asking if he joins them to the South since the White Walkers would probably hit Greywater Watch soon. Howland Reed tells that he’s ready to die. He doesn’t care of his life anymore, now with his children being passed away. He tells Jon Snow the Walkers can have him. He tells Jon he also needs to pay for his sins, for killing Arthur Dayne behind his back. He tells Jon the story of how he saw Ned Stark with baby Jon in his arms.

His uncle always wanted to keep him safe, even willing to sacrifice his life for Jon. Howland tells Jon he recognizes a lot of traits of Ned in Jon Snow and says that he would make a good ruler on the Iron Throne. Jon insists that he isn’t interested in that and leaves Howland Reed.

• Then, we see Cersei in King’s Landing. Qyburn visits the chamber of the Hand and informs Cersei that Winterfell has been attacked and that Daenerys and Jon have lost a great deal of their army. Cersei smiles. Qyburn also tells that the Lannister army has joined the Battle at Winterfell apperently. Cersei asks if Jaime has survived, but Qyburn tells he doesn’t know. Cersei answers that he shouldn’t have. After that, Euron arrives back in King’s Landing. He comes to tell Cersei that the Golden Company succefully took Storm’s End and that the army is gathered right there. He tells Cersei he finally wants to receive his reward and they shouldn’t wait to marry and be husband and wife tonight. Cersei reluctantly agrees.

• It’s still night in Greywater Watch and the characters stay there until morning. Jon and Daenerys sleep together in a hut. Daenerys finally tells Jon that she’s pregnant with his child. Jon is surprised and expresses his happiness toward Daenerys. He jokes that this is the only good thing that happened to them at the moment. He also wonders about their child’s health since they’re family. Daenerys comforts Jon the Targaryens have been inbreeding for years and she’s perfectly healthy. Daenerys thinks she’s having a son again, and asks Jon what he would name their son. Jon thinks he should be named after the greatest person he knew in his life, the one that saved his life, his uncle Ned. He wants his son to be named Eddard Targaryen. Daenerys repeats the name and smiles.

She says she likes it very much. The two start to kiss in their hut. Jaime visits Brienne’s hut as well. Brienne grieves over Podrick’s death, telling him that Podrick was the least person to deserves to die like that. Jaime agrees telling Brienne that he was a good lad and he was lucky to have been around Brienne all that time.

• The Hound and Arya make a fire during the night. The Hound asks how she managed to cross off almost every name of her list, but before Arya can respond she tells the Hound to shut up. She hears some strange noises. Not much later, a group of wights attack Arya and the Hound. The two begin to fight the wights but more wights come since they’re attracted to the noise. It’s then when Nymeria and a much larger pack of wolves come in between and kill off a big bunch of Wights. A lot of wolves die too. When most of the Wights are killed off, The Hound thinks they should flee as soon as they can before another group of Wights comes to kill them off. Arya discovers that she has lost Needle during the fight, but the Hound insists that there’s no time left to search for the damned sword and that they should leave immediately. This time Arya manages to have Nymeria follow her and the Hound.

• The wedding between Cersei Lannister and Euron Greyjoy takes place in the Throne Room. Euron looks very delighted, Cersei not so. It’s Qyburn who has them married. Cersei wears a tight, long black dress. She looks quite sad during the wedding. The wedding scene itself doesn’t take long and the scene switches to their wedding bed. This scene is an intercut between Cersei and Euron having sex and Jaime and Brienne also having sex in their hut. The two still think of each other.

• Next morning, the group departs from Greywater Watch and Jon and Sansa say goodbye to each other for the time being. Jon asks Gendry to keep his sister safe. Daenerys and Jon also say goodbye and leave each other. Daenerys tells Jon that Drogon should stay with him. They’ll need him to fight the Night King. The two kiss before leaving each other. Jorah is still having difficulties with that. We see all of the character go different ways and that’s how the episode ends.

• Died: a lot of Wights and wolves, Lyanna Mormont (off-screen)

End Episode 3

First outline season 8, episode 4

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS MIGHT ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

EDIT: ORIGINALLY, HOWLAND DIED DURING EP.2 BUT THE WRITERS CHOSE TO INCLUDE GREYWATER WATCH LATER ON.

• The first scene will take place in King’s Landing. Cersei speaks with Qyburn, Euron and the three Commanders of the Golden Company. Qyburn informs them that Daenerys and Jon have been splitting up their army and that Jaime is currently with Jon and Edmure in Riverrun, probably awaiting an attack from the Night King. Pyke has been taken again by Theon Greyjoy and Jon’s army, which visibly angers Euron. Daenerys traveled back to Dragonstone. Cersei laughs and tells the rest she hopes the Night King devours their army soon enough. They shouldn’t wait too long and have the Golden Company attack Dragonstone since Daenerys’s army is reduced remarkably. Euron Greyjoy is watching the Iron Throne when Cersei joins him in the Throne Room. She asks Euron why he doesn’t attack Pyke, since his nephew has taken it from him. Euron initially thinks it’s a stupid idea to go North now, but Cersei convinces him to learn them another lesson. Euron decides to take his fleet and travels to Pyke.

• Cersei and Qyburn are watching from above how Euron leaves. Qyburn asks Cersei if it is smart to have their most important ally travel so far North at the moment. Cersei tells Qyburn she hopes her enemies deal with Euron Greyjoy and that he never returns to King’s Landing.

• Daenerys, Sam, Gilly, Varys and Missandei have returned to Dragonstone. Varys reports to Daenerys that Cersei has hired the Golden Company and that Euron’s ships has been seen leaving King’s Landing. They could attack her any moment, now that her forces are weakened. Daenerys agrees and hopes that Jon and co. finishes the Night King’s army as soon as possible. When Daenerys takes a bath, Missandei remarks that she’s visibly pregnant right by now. Daenerys asks Missandei how she deals with Grey Worm’s death, at which Missandei responds that she’s missing him every day. Missandei asks Daenerys whether she misses Jon. Daenerys says she does. Next scene is Samwell with Gilly and Little Sam. Samwell wants Gilly to travel to Horn Hill with Little Sam. They aren’t safe in Dragonstone with enemies from all sides. Gilly reminds Sam that he promised her not to leave them, but Sam insists that they must. They’ll be safe with his mother and sister. He promises that he’ll fight for them.

• Jaime, Jon, Bronn, Tyrion, Jorah and Edmure are already in Riverrun. Jon mentions that the Army of the Dead has been seen reaching the Twins. They will be upon them soon and tells them they should take their armies to the Eyrie immediately. Tyrion takes the time to ask Jaime about Cersei and why he chosen to leave her. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei will never find peace after the deaths of their children and chose to betray everybody during the Dragonpit by hiring the Golden Company. Their relationship fully consumed him. Tyrion reminds the rest that Daenerys isn’t safe in Dragonstone, now that Cersei has an army of thousands of sellswords behind her back. She could attack Dragonstone any moment from now. Jorah think his place should be with his queen now as he promised to protect her at any cost. Jon seems to agree and lets him go.

Jon sends word to his sister, Sansa, to inform her that the Army of the Dead will reach the Vale soon and that their army is marching to the Vale now.

• Cersei stands with the commanders of the Golden Company on the giant map of Westeros. She instructs the commanders to take their men to Dragonstone with Euron’s remaining ships and to capture Daenerys Targaryen. She can’t wait to kill the foreign whore herself. The commanders leave and obey her orders.

• Sansa receives word from Jon Snow and orders the Lords of the Vale that they should prepare now. She convinces Robin Arryn to have Lord Royce lead the Knights of the Vale. Robin tells Sansa he intends to fight with them. Sansa answers Robin that it’s not a good idea and that he should be kept safe. Robin laughs and tells Sansa that he’s not a girl, unlike Sansa. Gendry and Sansa have a conversation as well. Sansa asks how Gendry came to meet Arya, but he tells Sansa that the story is too long to tell. The two seem to get well along and Sansa thanks him for fighting with them.

• Missandei receives a visitor in Dragonstone. She first asks after Jon Snow, but is happy to meet Daenerys as well. It seems to be old Melisandre who comes to bring them important news. Old Melisandre tells them that a great last sacrifice should be made if they want to win the war and that it requires true king’s blood. Old Melisandre points at Daenerys’s baby. Daenerys is furious at the old lady and sends her away immediately. Before Old Melisandre leaves, Varys talks with her outside. Melisandre makes her identity known, which has Varys shocked. She tells Varys that he should remember what the voice said in the flames. He should be the one to save the common people from the doom. She asks Varys to fulfill the prophecy and save Westeros. Varys can’t utter a word. Melisandre leaves Dragonstone and the series.

• The next shot takes place in Pyke. Theon Greyjoy is sitting on his father’s chair when his men come to tell him that Euron Greyjoy has arrived in Pyke as well. Euron speaks with Theon outside. He has Yara with him and tells Theon that he should give up Pyke already or he’ll slit his sister’s throat in front of him. Theon is starting to notice that it’s getting a lot colder and he can see his breath. He tells Euron that they are coming for them, but Euron doesn’t understand at first. Men start to scream and Wights start invading Pyke. Yara takes adventage of the moment and kicks Euron. Theon implores Yara to escape to Dragonstone. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he won’t fail her another time. Yara wants Theon to come with her, but tells her he won’t fail her another time. She escapes on a small ship with a few loyal men. Theon fights Euron himself. Ironborn and Northmen fight the wights, while Euron battles Theon. Euron gets the upper-hand and swings his axe Theon right in Theon’s body. Theon dies immediately, Euron laughs. Euron implores his men to leave Pyke with the boats. A lot of his men have died, but Euron manages to escape.

First outline season 8, episode 5

HBO LEAK

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY OUTLINE, MANY THINGS ARE STILL BEING CHANGED AT THE MOMENT.

NOTE: DURATION TIME (=/- 100 min.)

• First scene will only include the soundtrack of R. Djawadi, there’s no dialogue in the first five minutes. We first see the Knights of the Vale preparing themselves for an attack. We get a shot of the Lannister, Tully and Stark army marching to the Vale. Jaime, Tyrion, Edmure and Bronn are seen leading their men. Then we see the Golden Company getting on board of Euron Greyjoy’s ships. The Knights of the Vale see a huge storm approaching slowly, Yohn Royce is commanding the Army of the Vale to keep their spears of dragonglass ready. Robin Arryn fights alongside Yohn Royce. Lord Royce isn’t too pleased to have Robin Arryn commanding their men. You can literally read that from his face.

• First line comes from Yohn Royce who commands his men to keep ready. Wights start to invade the Bloody Gate. Robin Arryn is commanding the archers, but fails miserably. Inside the Eyrie, we see Lady Sansa together with Gendry and Brienne of Tarth. Gendry says goodbye to Sansa and joins the fight. Sansa tells Gendry she hopes he’ll come back. Gendry expresses his doubt. Brienne of Tarth also wants to join the fight, but Sansa isn’t too fond of that idea. She wants Brienne to stay with her, but Brienne says she can’t save Sansa if the Wights invade inside the Eyrie as well. She swore to protect Sansa and the best way to do that is to keep the entry of the Vale safe from the Night King’s army. Sansa hugs Brienne and thanks her for everything she has done to protect her family. Brienne leaves to join the fight.

• Next scene takes place in Dragonstone. News reaches Dragonstone that the Golden Company is on their way to attack Queen Daenerys. Daenerys commands her remaining Unsullied and Dothraki to protect Dragonstone from invading there. Varys advises her to leave Dragonstone immediately, but Daenerys doesn’t listen to his counsel. She realizes that her water has broken and she’s ready to labor. Missandei and Samwell help Daenerys and make her rest right away. Samwell is worried because Daenerys’s baby is coming way to soon.

• Then we see three White Walkers from a distance watching how the Wights win from the Knights of the Vale. The Night King is flying on Viserion above the White Walkers, watching the spectacle as well. Viserion apparently has lost one of his eyes and his right wing got gravely injured. Brienne is fighting for her life. Robin Arryn is almost attacked by several Wights and runs away to hide inside of the Eyrie. Sansa confronts him that he promised to fight with his men, but Robin expresses his lack of interest in the survival of his men.

Brienne, Lord Royce and Gendry continue to fight but it looks like a losing side until now. The White Walkers now start to invade the Eyrie as well. A roaring Undead Dragon can be heard. A one blue-eyed Undead Viserion flies above Lord Royce and his men and sets them afire. Then we hear the roaring of another dragon. The Night King looks behind and sees Jon Snow on Drogon helping the Lord of Vale out. Beneath Jon Snow, we see the Tully, Lannister and Northern forces joining the fray. Lots of Wights are set afire by Drogon while the Westerosi armies slaughter them. It looks like the Dragonfire doesn’t affect the White Walkers, though. Bronn manages to kill of a White Walker with two spears of Dragonglass. Jaime sees that Brienne is getting in trouble with another White Walker. She gets stabbed right in the guts and that’s when Jaime goes mad and stabs the WW from behind. Brienne is dying and Jaime holds her in her arms. She asks Jaime to keep Sansa and Arya safe, as she promised that to Lady Catelyn. Jaime says he will do that for her. Brienne last words are that Jaime is a honorable man. She dies in his arms.

• Arya, the Hound and Nymeria are entering a snowy King’s Landing. The Hound remarks that he hasn’t missed the stinking city at all and Arya agrees. Arya notices that the city has changed a lot since she has left and walks past a destroyed Sept of Baelor. To be in the same place again reminds her of Ned Stark. She tells the Hound it’s time to pay the Lannisters their debts.

• Daenerys is starting to labor. It’s Samwell and Missandei who help her with it. Varys witnesses how a smaller part of the Golden Company is invading the shores of Dragonstone. The Unsullied try to stop them from entering the stairs to the castle. The Dothraki fight them on shore. Jorah and a small part of the Northern army join the fight as well. Jorah tries to get inside the castle to protect Daenerys.

• In the Eyrie, the army of the Undead is diminishing by the second. Edmure is leading his men very well; Tyrion does too. The Night King is no longer mounting Viserion and tries to get inside the Eyrie with another White Walker. Viserion tries to attack Gendry and opens his mouth to spit fire on him. Gendry mounts a spear of Dragonglass in the mouth of the dragon. Undead Viserion falls from the rocks of the bloody gate and it is Drogon who finishes the job and sets Viserion on fire.

• Jorah has made it into Dragonstone and finds Daenerys laboring. Things don’t look too bright for her. A sad Samwell concludes that both mother and child could never survive together and he only can save one of them. Jorah wants Daenerys to survive but Daenerys doesn’t want to give up on her baby. Samwell sets through and Daenerys manages to deliver her baby. Samwell tells Daenerys that she has delivered a girl and asks for her name. A very weakened Daenerys wants to name her baby Lyanna, as Jon would have liked that. Daenerys is dying and Missandei, Varys and Jorah realize that. The Golden Company is getting the upper-hand and start to invade the stairs to Dragonstone as well. Daenerys says goodbye to Jorah and thanks him for always being there for her. Jorah expresses his love for her and Daenerys asks Jorah to continue his oath and to keep her daughter safe for her together with Missandei. She asks Jorah to release her from her suffering and to kill her. Jorah says he never could and it’s Varys who puts Samwell’s sword, Heartsbane, through Daenerys’s chest.

• Cersei Lannister and the Mountain receive Qyburn in the Throne Room. He comes to tell her that Daenerys has been defeated. Cersei laughes and both drink to celebrate their victory. Cersei begins to feel dizzy and the audience realizes that it’s Arya with Qyburn’s face. She has poisoned Cersei with Jaqen’s vial. Qyburn starts to confront her and Cersei realizes that something is not right here. That’s when Arya makes her identity known. She tells Cersei that a lion should never have fought with a pack of wolves. Cersei begs The Mountain to kill off Arya but Arya tells her that won’t help. She brings in Nymeria and the Hound to finish the job. Nymeria gravely injures Cersei and the Hound combats with the Mountain. It’s Arya who finishes Cersei and slits her throat. Nymeria and the Hound destroys the Mountain but he doesn’t seem to die. The Mountain loses his helmet at some point and that’s when the Hound manages to burn his face with fire. The Mountain is left to die and The Hound, Arya and Nymeria leave The Red Keep.

• The Commanders of the Golden Company have entered the castle and order Varys to hand over Daenerys to them. Varys tell them that Daenerys has died and the Commanders clear Varys out of their way and stab him. They indeed find Daenerys’s body and take her body with them to bring it to Queen Cersei. Samwell is able to hide himself together with Missandei and Dany’s baby. The Golden Company retreat back to King’s Landing.

• Euron Greyjoy arrives back in King’s Landing to find out that Queen Cersei has been slaughtered. He pretends to be saddened by her death.

Jon Snow and Sansa Stark arrive back in Dragonstone to find out that everyone has been slaughtered. Samwell meets him on the stairs with Jon’s child in his arms. Jon starts to weep. He asks if Daenerys has made it, but Samwell is sad to tell him she has not. He tells him she named their daughter Lyanna Targaryen.

• The last scene of the episode is the coronation of King Euron I Greyjoy. He is made King of the Seven Kingdoms.

[SPOILERS] My Late S8 Predictions,"Okay so these are my final predictions for S8 (my Predictions I am set on until I am proven wrong otherwise, Now yes I already did something like this already but I took it down because I feel there is more too say and I wanted to TRY and make it as short as possible, Also I will be combining my own ideas with news on the season and atleast one leak. Also stuff we know will happen such as Jon's reunions, Arya+Gendry Reunion, and Jon learning the truth will not be included. Now that I got that out of the way let's begin:

- NK destroys the rest of the Wall, with it falling on Edd and NW.

- Cersei has a miscarriage and sends Euron, Strickland, and the GC to sack WF for it’s food.

- Jaime and Bronn arrive in WF with a Army from the Riverlands, Theon also arrives (after his rescue mission backfires)

- Jon ends the relationship with Dany once he finds out the truth

- Howland and Mel in old lady form arrive at WF at some point

- In a twist Arya is actually not happy with Jon bending the knee at first

- The first battle is brutal resulting in the deaths of Ghost, Grey Worm, Yohn Royce, Tormund, and most of the Northern Lords.

- Euron with Strickland and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame, Mel fights the NK via magic, she dies due to being weakened

- Euron+GC steal ships Theon and Dany left at White Harbor to sail back to KL, Theon uses the remaining ships to follow them.

- Gendry dies but is given the kiss of life by Beric, Arya heads to KL to deal with Cersei with Gendry going with her (they also admit there feelings for each other at some point sharing a kiss)

- Everyone (except for Arya, Gendry, and Theon) evacuate to Riverlands

- Jaime, Brienne, Bronn, and The Hound go on there own mission to deal with Cersei.

- Boatbaby twins, Dany and Drogon die fighting the NK and Viserion.

- CLEGANEBOWL, the Hound wins but dies not long after too bloodlose, Arya almost kills Cersei but chooses Justice over Vengeance and let’s Jaime get the kill.

- Theon fails to save her sister but does sacrifice himself killing Euron to save Arya, Jaime and Brienne sets off the wildfire killing the Wights that have made it into KL. But also kills Bronn, Varys, Qyburn, Damphair, the Little Birds, Strickland, Rhaegal, and any citizens not lucky enough to escape.

- Jon 1v1 the NK in the God’s Eye not before NK kills Howland Reed, Jon is able to neutralize him and with help from Bran and Sam take the piece of Dragonglass in him out of him, killing the NK but making all the Wights (including Viserion) collapse and turning the WW’s back to human.

- The throne is melted down and a Proto-Democratic Government is established with Jon elected the new King and raising his children on his own, Sam and Gilly are mad Lord and Lady of the Reach.

- Edmure is made Lord of the Riverlands, Robin remains Lord of the Vale, Sansa Queen in the North (taking Pod as her husband), New houses ruling Dorne, Storm Lands, and Pyke, and Tyrion rules the Westerlands.

- Arya and Gendry together sail to lands more west, Bran leaves beyond the Wall, And Sam writes a Song of Ice and Fire.

Alternate Ending:

- Arya and Gendry are elected the new rulers of Westeros and Jon leaves beyond the wall with Bran taking his children with him.

Okay now for some notes:

- If you are wondering I think we do get a show version of the Forsaken chapter and also the first scene where we meet Howland is in Wintertown

- I didn’t include Tormund and Beric making it to WF or how Bronn and Jaime getting the Army because I feel the simplest answer is that Roslin gave them an army made up of Frey soldiers and Riverlands soldiers Loyal to Edmure and I think people are smart enough to know that Tormund and Beric would make it back to WF.

- How I would write Edmure and Meera out of the show is that Howland had her stay in the Neck and maybe she dies off screen from the WW’s and also Edmure has also been hiding out in the Neck but he survives the WW’s",gameofthrones,True,1525617501,2018-05-06

[NO SPOILERS] The Winged Knight and the Age of Heroes,"Sooooo I just found out about this guy and . . . Holy shit. I know it's not ""the point"" of the series. At the same time, the Age of Heroes sounds like the fantasy series I wish I was watching a lot of the times. Again, I know GRRM said they're supposed to be ""as separated from them as we are from King Solomon."" It's not like we don't make stories about such figures of antiquity anyway though.

In any case, out of all the figures of the Age of Heroes he, and Symeon Star-Eyes, might be my favorite. He flew on the back of a giant falcon and commanded armies of eagles. He also was chill with the giants and married one of the Children of the Forest, an immortal Fey creature. I want to BE this guy!

I do have a theory about him. It's said by the Maesters that he was completely fabricated and/or that he may have been a dragon rider. Well, my interpretation is that his giant bird was either a unique freak of nature or part of a species long since extinct. After all, no one thinks mammoths are around anymore yet we see them north of the Wall. 

Furthermore, I think the Winged Knight was a warg. It could be his bond with his mount was a special union and it could be how he commanded other birds. Would also explain his marriage to one of the Children, she may have seen a kindred spirit in him.

[Spoilers] Is Stannis really that great?,"This is just my \(strong\) opinion, i'm really intrested in yours if you disagree

Many people think that show Stannis was a character assassination, so on this post i'm gonna focus on book Stannis, here we go...

A lot of people really seem to think of Stannis as the perfect candidate for king, while i'm....well... unimpressed

Most of his deffenders often say he is the fairest, most honourable and just man in Westeros, who never wanted power or to be King and sees it only as an obligation... well... i'm not buying that

Remember when he was about to kill an innocent boy to get this throne he doesn't even really want? that was fun

ok, besides, was he really going to be that great a king? aside from the willing\-to\-snuff\-an\-innocent\-life\-for\-what\-is\-right mentallity, what makes you think he would be a good king? he's a good general, sure, but from what i take of his personality, he doesn't seem to be very pragmatic, he seems to be likely to make the same mistakes that Ned has done with the always\-doing\-what\-is\-right way of life

Now i rest my case

Bonus: There's a passage where is told he sugested in a small council meeting to close all the brothels in king's Landing... given the circumstances, i don't think that was a great idea.",gameofthrones,True,1525676575,2018-05-07

[NO SPOILERS] George RR Martin points the writers of GoT to Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy,"Dear Jonathan and Lisa,

I'm having a hard time coming up with an ending to GoT. The writers for the series are really on my ass and while I care more about the books I still need to help them complete the TV series. Because of this conundrum I come to you. I feel like Westworld provides the best possible ending to my TV show since the people of TV are way more demanding then the book people. Also, no one reads books anymore besides nerds and that isn't my target audience for the TV series. Second: I don't know how to end the book series, but at least with this I can end the TV series and satisfy the needy TV people and get them off my ass. Seriously, why do they care more about an ending instead of a GOOD ending? Anyway, I think GoT would be a great setting to be one of your ""parks"" that you own and so the story itself is just a narrative that was created to entertain people. Wouldn't it be something the Cersei Lannister was just a 'guest' and that is why all that shit happened? Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you collaborated or a crossover episode to tie these two stories together.

My Best,

[SPOILERS] Children of the forest and a possible bittersweet finale,"It is a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG offseason, way too long so we are all dwelling on what will happen. I always think the real ending will add the least amount to the story and will be the most direct but should be surprising. 
_________________________________________________________________________
""Showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss tell EW those conversations included “three holy sh– moments” in particular.""

The first: Stannis Barathon sacrificing his daughter Shireen — which was shown during the show’s fifth season.

The second: Hodor’s mind-bending origin story, which was revealed in Sunday’s hour. Martin has known the true meaning behind Hodor’s name since introducing the character in the first novel of the saga, A Game of Thrones.

And the third shocking moment?

“… is from the very end…,” Benioff teased.
__________________________________________________________________________

Other shocking things happened in these last seasons from Littlefingers demise to the Battle of the Bastards ending with Sansa feeding Ramsay to wolves to Oberyn getting his skull smashed or the Septons exploding. But these two were picked and both involve magic/LOL/Three Eyed Raven...so I wonder if the third twist will relate to the two they have chosen to call out:

Because of the required sacrifice to the LOL, Stannis burnt his own daughter. It didn't bring him victory but Mel requested it. The LOL seems to get a pass for wiping out Stannis army but he didn't conjure up anything for this kings blood, no magic demon arrived to kill Ramsay this time. He just left Stannis on his own to be wiped out.

Had Stannis won he would have been a strong friend to Jon, no? He seemed to like Jon very much and would have probably backed him in the war with the White Walkers...so why did the LOL hang him out to dry?

Hodor - this revealed Bran can not only see but can change the past. Not only him presumably but also the Three Eyed Raven, who was hanging out with what may have been the ""last??"" of the Children of the Forest. I found the scene sad but while Hodor was a huge fan favorite, the fact Bran could time travel and effect someone in the past was way more of a shock to me than Hodor dying which is common in GoT. 

I always felt the below facts were very strange:

* The COTF were at war with man and created White Walkers
* The COTF put dragonglass in a man at some point and did it again with Coldhands and allowed him to keep his mind somewhat
* The COTF saved mankind from the White Walkers by fighting with us against a different looking bearded NK and are benevolent to man and against the White Walkers they created

* MOST IMPORTANTLY - ONLY WE THE VIEWERS KNOW THEY MADE THE WHITE WALKERS, NO ONE KNOWS IN WESTEROS AND IT IS NOT PART OF THE LEGEND AND SO LIKELY NO ONE KNEW THEN AND THIS WAS HIDDEN FROM MANKIND...WHO WOULD LIKELY BLAME THE COTF IF THEY KNEW, NO?

* The COTF and man made a pact at some point to protect the trees
* The COTF were hunted to extinction by men
* The COTF are on the wrong side of the wall
* The Wildlings are on the wrong side of the wall with them but didn't seem to have any contact with them
* The COTF used Howland Reed to send Jojen who knew he'd die to get Bran and bring him to them
* The COTF saved Bran but not Jojen and blew him up with a grenade rather than let him turn into a White Walker
* The COTF cave is littered in skulls???

I think mankind was battling the COTF. This is a fact. The White Walkers were a doomsday device created by the COTF when other weapons didn't slow man's advance. I think the COTF never told man where they came from and invented the ""other"" to trick man into thinking there was a ""new threat"" then together with man they could ""unite"".

The concept that the WW are ""out of their control"" is something new, likely a new lie if you will to cover for an old lie that was revealed. Originally I think they used the WW successfully to bring man to the bargaining table, we only went to the COTF for help (see happy cave painting) because we didn't know they made the evil things! 

I see no evidence they ever failed to perform as the COTF intended and while the NK might hate the COTF it might be because he is just a pawn of theirs albeit one they can't completely control. 

I think one of two things happened: 

The Westerosi figured out they made the WW and punished them (and the heroes who fought with the COTF against the WW) by locking them outside the wall. 

OR 

in just true Westerosi fashion the men that left to fight the WW and the COTF were outfoxed and once they fulfilled their mission of pushing the Walkers back were left for dead north of the wall. 

The dark cave with skulls in the north seems like the green children of the forest had been corrupted and bitter after all these years and dealing with men (who GOT has shown to be awful). So my bet is that the COTF will surface once more and a big twist revolving around the NK will reveal him to be honorably revenge driven and the COTF/Three Eyed Raven the guilty party...which will be a real issue for Jon. The NK will want revenge on the COTF and Bran is their three eyed raven...

TLDR

Jon killing Bran out of duty to satisfy the NK (similar to the opening of the show when Bran and Jon watched the execution, see 1:18 on the below) could be a bittersweet ending.

[SPOILERS] My late S8 Predictions Updated,"Okay so if you are wondering why I am posting this again well funny story my other post I accidentally deleted, so I decided to try and post it again, but with a few changes, Like before I’ll be leaving out stuff we know will happen and I will be combining my own ideas with atleast one leak and news I heard. Also I would like to clarify these are MY ideas okay there for not everything needs to be perfect:

- Something happens to Edd and the NW (now weather or not NK destroys the rest of the Wall or they are left alone I am not sure but either way something will happen)

- Cersei has a miscarriage and sends Euron, Strickland, and the GC to sack WF for it’s food.

- Theon arrives after Jaime and Bronn (after the rescue mission to save his sister backfires)

- Mel in old lady form arrive at WF at some point

- In a twist Arya is actually not happy with Jon bending the knee at first

- The first battle is brutal resulting in the deaths of Ghost, Grey Worm, Yohn Royce, Tormund, Bronn, and most of the Northern Lords.

- Euron with Strickland and the GC surprise attack WF setting it aflame, Mel fights the NK via magic, she dies due to being weakened

- Euron+GC use ships Euron send there prior to sail back to KL, Theon follow them.

- Gendry dies but is given the kiss of life by Beric, Arya heads to KL to deal with Cersei with Gendry going with her (they also admit there feelings for each other at some point sharing a kiss)

- Everyone (except for Arya, Gendry, and Theon) evacuate to Riverlands

- Jaime, Brienne, and The Hound go on there own mission to deal with Cersei.

- BoatBaby twins

- Dany and Drogon die in battle against the NK and Viserion

- Arya is about to kill Cersei but chooses vengeance over Justice letting Jaime get the kill.

- CLEGANEBOWL, the Hound wins but dies not long after to bloodlose

- Jaime sets off the wildfire with Brienne destroying the Wights that have entered the city. But this also results in the deaths of Qyburn, Varys, Harry, Brienne, Rhaegal, and any citizen not lucky enough to escape.

- Varys and Tyrion where taken hostage but escaped thanks to Jaime

- Theon avenges his sister and saves Arya by sacrificing himself killing Euron

- Jon defeats the NK and with help from Bran and Sam removes the Dragonglass in his chest.

- The Wights collapse and WW’s turn back to human with the curse lifted from them.

- The throne is melted down and a Proto-Democratic Government is established with election for the new king. Jon is elected the king of the Seven Kingdoms.

- Bran leaves with the now turned human WW’s, Sansa is queen of the North, Arya and Gendry sail more west, and Sam lord of the Reach starts writing a song of ice and fire

ALTERNATE ENDING:
- Arya and Gendry are elected king and queen of the seven kingdoms and Jon goes beyond the wall with Bran to raise his twin children away from a life of ruling.

Oh and if your wondering Tyrion is lord of Westerlands, Edmure Lord of the Riverlands, Robin Lord of the Vale, and new houses ruling Stormlands, Pyke, and Maybe Dorne. Also I would write Meera and Edmure out by saying Edmure when to the Neck after escaping the Twins and Meera just stayed in the Neck.

"[SPOILERS] Stannis, ""seagulls"", and the siege of Storm's End","So, I'm at the episode The Lion and The Rose, famous for the Purple Wedding, during my rewatch, but the most interesting new detail that caught my attention was from a completely different part of the episode. Stannis, Selyse and Melisandre are having an awkward family dinner, with Selyse chatting about the starvation they had to endure during the siege of Storm's End and how Stannis made her soup from books. She also mentions this tidbit:  ""One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull.""

Now, there is a somewhat well-known [anecdote](https://www.riddles.com/archives/2581) about the survivors of a shipwreck who are washed up on a deserted island alongside the dead bodies of all their friends. The only source of food for the survivors are the seagulls who sometimes land on the island, and who are really difficult to catch. One of the survivors is an able hunter though, providing food made from seagulls to the others, who all find it exceptionally tasty. Eventually, they are rescued. Years later, one of the survivors orders a plate of seagull in a restaurant, since it was the best thing he had ever tasted... only, the seagull served by the restaurant doesn't taste like anything what he had on the island, and he has to come to a terrible realization about what the food they ate during that time actually was. (The story is often posed as a riddle such as ""A man walks into a restaurant and orders a plate of seagull, takes 1 bit walks out of the restaurant and kills himself. Why?"")

Does anybody else think Selyse's rather unnecessary comment is meant to be an implication of something similar happening? The theme of cannibalism is not exactly unheard of in GoT and ASOIAF, and it also seems like something Stannis would be able to do out of necessity, but spare his wife from the details. We do know how they had to eat dogs and rats as a last resort before Davos' shipment, it doesn't seem far-fetched that they had to resort to an even more drastic solution, at least for Selyse, who was mentioned to be completely weakened by the end of the siege. I don't recall if there is anything similar in the books, but the episode was actually written by GRRM, and I can definitely imagine him being familiar with this horrific seagull riddle and injecting a reference to it.

[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones ending theory,"Many people think that if the Night King will be easy to defeat, the show will end on a bad note, as all of this build-up for a few swings of the sword wouldn't be enough, the fight would turn out to be Jon Snow against the Night King, but here is where another theory comes into play.
What if the Night King is Bran Stark, just as other people theorised, and what if this will mean that in order to defeat the Night King, Bran Stark would have to die (or if the Night King dies, so does Bran). This could be the bitter-sweet ending that I believe would be the best option ( not exactly this scenario, but a bitter-sweet ending has to be the way to end, not a ''Happily ever after'' type of ending ), I also doubt that if this did happen, no one else from the main cast ( the ones that are considered good ; Daenerys, Jon, Tyrion, etc ) would all live as well, here is how I think it could turn out:
- Bran see's in one of his visions (already forgot what they're called, green sight I believe), that he is somehow connected or is fully the Night King.
- Jon fights the Night King, but something interrupts the fight mid-way/near the end, leading to an unfinished battle.
- Jon meets Bran (The directors could do a similar thing as they did with the Tower of Joy - Show half of the scene in one episode ( the fight between Ned and Dayne ) and revealing Jon's true identity in episodes later on) in this scene we could be introduced to a precursor of the Night King, then in the same episode that Jon meets up with Bran we could be shown the truth about Bran), Jon tells Bran that he didn't defeat the Night King, to which Bran responds something along the lines of - ""I know, because I'm here"".
- After all this happens / ends, the Night King is defeated with Bran dying (He either sacrificed himself or Jon fought the Night King again, also the Night King could be the one explaining to Jon that he is Bran during the fight and then Bran 'connects' with the Night King - This scene could happen if Jon and Bran did not meet)
- Later on, after other things/events occur, Daenerys is officially pregnant, time goes by quicker now and we end up with Jon's kid being born and Daenerys dying ( Just like the mother's of all three dragons; Jon, Tyrion and Daenerys did). 
Or alternatively Jon due to the Night King / Golden Company ( Which I believe Naario or whatever his name is, will join when he finds out that Daenerys is with Jon, as he had feelings for her and fight with Jon, killing him ), now we see a time skip when Jon's kid is born, Daenerys dies and Tyrion takes care of him, then another time skip occurs/during the same scene when Tyrion takes him after Daenerys' death and mentions something about his parents being great people and that he will grow up to be like them.
This would be a VERY bitter but somewhat sweet ending. 
More of my theory could be added after I come up with something either ridiculous or something that could make sense.",gameofthrones,True,1525880762,2018-05-09

[SPOILERS] Who do you think will win the game of thrones?,"I strongly suspect that no one will win, because GRRM said, that he does not belive that war and violence can lead to any good or satisfying solution. It seems likely, that the iron throne will be destroyed in the battles for it, maybe even all of Kings Landing. 
Just think about it:
Arya, Cersei, Jamie, Danaerys, Ellaria, Yara, Euron, Melisandre, Bronn, th Mountain and the Hound are ruled out for obvious reasons.
Sansa too, she is definitely out for blood now.
Jon would be way to obvious and cliché.
I don't think Theon, Varys or sweet Robin have any real chance. 
That leaves Bran, but I think he will live and fall with the Night King; Brienne, but her story is too twisted with Jamies and I strongly feel like she will end up killing Cersei and become the ""Queen Slayer"" due to the prophecy of the younger and more beautiful queen in the books and Briennes ""nickname"", or having to kill Jamie and maybe commit suicide after that (?); Sam, but he seems more like the narrator of the story, writing how it came, that everything burnt down to ashes; Tyrion, who seems like the only ""real"" candidate left, but I kinda think, he will be way to pissed of of any kind of politics and power games after all this is over.

[SPOILERS]? Question about Lord Hoster Tully in the books.,"The only reason I haven't Googled/searched for the answer is because I don't want to spoil it for myself.  I just finished the 3rd book and I have watched every episode of the show.  

My question is about Lord Hoster Tully and Tansy.  While on his deathbed he constantly talks to Cat about Tansy, but from Cat's perspective you never know wtf happens with her.  With Lord Beric's outlaws you meet Tansy in one of the villages they go to, but I wasn't able to get any connection to Lord Hoster from what I read.  Did I miss something?  Or is the connection discovered later in the books?  My assumption is that with dead Cat now with Beric's outlaws that she will go to whatever village Tansy was in and learn the answer herself, but I can't help but feel I didn't catch the answer earlier in the 3rd book when we met Tansy.

If they could load a ton of wildfire into a bunch of containers they could fly FAR over the battlefield (so un-dead Viserion can't see them) and drop them on the army of the dead. I don't know how they would light the wildfire though. Maybe the living could shoot a bunch of flaming arrows to time it with the landing of the ""bombs"".

[Spoilers] Cersei the Mad Queen,"Okay - can we just take a second to talk about the world of inbreeding and hypocrisy that is Tywin Lannister. So we hear Jaime and Cersei talk about the Targaryens marrying brother and sisters to keep bloodlines pure but the show neglects to address the Lannister's history of inbreeding creating the enigma that incest is ""impure"" and ""sinful"" and Jaime and Cersei will be cast into the seventh circle of hell for their relationship. Also let me clarify that I do not support incest - just pointing out Lannister history and faults in Tywin's character that the show skrt skrts around. 

When Cersei tells Tywin of her and Jaime's relationship he is taken aback, aghast, disgusted, his ""legacy is a lie,"" etc etc. BUT, his own children are literally the product of incest! Now, maybe cousin marrying was not seen as incest to these noble families but it definitely would have created some genetic irregularities that created the ""Mad Queen,"" which just isn't talked about enough. Give me a sec to explain. 

Brief History: Tytos Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, has son Tywin Lannister, future Lord of Casterly Rock. Tytos' younger brother, Ser Jason Lannister, has children Damon and Joanna Lannister. Soon after, Tywin Lannister marries Joanna Lannister and the two have three children: Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion. Now, let me check my eyes real quick, because that's cousin marrying at it's finest. So, this is what I cannot wrap my hear around. How can Tywin justify his hypocrisy or even have the authority to judge the nature of his children's relationship when he, himself, had to marry his own cousin. I understand it's because the children were supposed to be Robert's, the line of lineage, Jaime and Cersei weren't married, not the true heirs to the throne, etc, but Tywin's feigned disgust about his children's incestuous relationship really grinded my gears for some reason. 

OK, back to the original point of my post: THE MAD QUEEN. Is Cersei so notoriously insane, temperamental and murderous because of genetic irregularities caused by inbreeding? I did a bit of research on royal lineages and inbreeding throughout royal families in Europe and yup - inbreeding was the main cause of insanity among ancient European monarchs. The show, in my opinion, attributes her insanity to her just being a fiercely protective mother who will do anything to protect her family, but I think there's a lil more going on there. 

To round up, I just wanted to shed a bit of light on the fact that Jaime and Cersei are not nearly the first in their family to have incestuous relations and offspring; Tywin's hypocrisy in failing to acknowledge that his own marriage was incest; and the indisputable fact that Cersei is just like the Mad King because her brain has been warped by years of mixed family bloodlines.

They specifically showed that it could hit the dragon, and all they would have to do is make a dragon glass tip, or attach a Valyrian steel weapon to the tip. If they hit him, it should kill him based on what we've seen on the show. It would be a cool way to bring down Viserion.

Assuming however that she is talking about some sort of afterlife, somehow I can't imagine that she envisions Tywin going to heaven as she has a low opinion of him and the things he did in life.

[SPOILERS] West of the Narrow Sea...,"... do you think we'll see it again? (exception to Bravos of course). Amidst all this chaos and war in Westeros and every character playing some part in it I often spare a thought for Daario Naharis and imagine what him and his second sons are up to, just chilling in Meereen making sure no one starts an uprising I'd guess. This, however, begs the question, will we see him and Essos again? If I remember rightly the army of the Dead do not venture outside of Westeros for obvious reasons (although the Night King could fly over? But that's another conversation) and so it's probably safe to assume he's safe from 'winter', also it's unlikely the writers would create a subplot of a rebellion in one of Essos' cities because who wants to see that? We have the living v the dead to get on with. If they do feature at all I believe they will be called over as reinforcements to help in the war, but then that begs the question, who will watch over Dany's territory in their absence?

EDIT: Just read an interesting idea that maybe the Narrow Sea could completely freeze over, and 'Winter' could cross over? They'd have the resources of dead Westerosi's at their disposal and I also learnt that cities far east in Essos (Yi-Ti I believe it's called) also have stories of ""the Long Night"" so maybe they're preparing for their own battle on the other side of the planet? So interesting to consider all the possibilities, they could even make a complete spin off of the distant cities battles with Winter and how they coped with it.",gameofthrones,True,1524479773,2018-04-23

[SPOILERS] a little theory about Bran,"This is just a small theory on something I noticed on my rewatch, during early season one. 

Shortly before Bran wakes from his coma, after he fell from the tower, Sansa’s Direwolf Lady was sentenced to execution. As we know from later seasons, Bran is a Warg (someone who can shift into animals and control them), and I believe that because of this power he is awoken literally by the death of Lady. 
Bran has a strong connection to the animals, and the death of a animal as important as a Direwolf may have influenced his awakening - directly after Lady dies, Bran wakes up and sits up in bed. 

I think that this is just a little bit of foreshadowing for his powers later on in the seasons and maybe shows his first instance of this ability. ",gameofthrones,True,1524498655,2018-04-23

Bronn appears to refuse however later in the episode Bronn says something to Podrick along the lines of ""Lets go get a drink and let the fancy folk talk."" Why focus on Bronn and Podrick leaving together

UNLESS...

Bronn wants to switch sides and wanted Podrick to pass a secret message to Tyrion and Dany. There are several reasons I feel Bronn would switch sides

Tyrion and Bronn are friends. I feel Bronn would rather work for his friend than the Lannister's. 

Bronn is a betting man and will choose whatever side is likely to win. Bronn was there when Dany's army attacked Lannister troops. He knows the Scorpion failed to take down the dragon. If he switches sides and Dany wins, which is likely he knows Tyrion will pay him well. ",gameofthrones,True,1524505013,2018-04-23

"[SPOILERS] a Season One Reflection: ""She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.""","More context of this quote from Season One, Episode Two The Kingsroad:

Robert Baratheon: There was that one...oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca, with the great big tits you could bury your face in?
Ned Stark: Bessie. She was one of yours.
Robert Baratheon: Bessie!' Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits! Yours was, uh...Aleena? No, you told me once. Uh...Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
Ned Stark: Wylla.
Robert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
Ned Stark: Nor will I.
Robert Baratheon: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear, if I weren't your king, you'd have hit me already.

I have been rewatching Season one and following Ned's reactions to things that touch on his own actions that, unknowingly to those involved, can be considered treason. Such as hiding and raising the Targ heir as his own bastard child. Ned emotionally reacting to Robert declaring his desire to kill all the Targaryens, Robert going on about his beloved Lyanna, etc.

Now that Jon has been outed to the audience as not just a Targ, but their legal heir, small pieces of dialogue hold so much more meaning. Robert once knew what this woman who ""made [Ned] forget his honor"" looked like, as it was Ned's sister and his own fiance. Although, by his own confession, he no longer remembers what she looked like. 

And Ned's words, ""Nor will I."" He never will because it could very possibly end in death for Jon, and reveal Ned's own treasonous actions. This scene is even more poignant as it was followed by Robert attempting to console Ned, unknowingly, for treasonous actions against himself. ",gameofthrones,True,1524530880,2018-04-23

**Could he have wrote it or not? What do you think? Please comment, even if you dislike. I am interested in any kind of opinion.**

""No one walks away from you, sister. That's what you told me. You put your Mountain Clegane between you and my freedom, beloved twin. Sister, you blew up the sept of Baelor in order to save yourself, not Tommen, and you sacrificed him! I've wondered since, what it is that drives you.

Fear, it is? Never!

Love it is? No.

Hatred and anger? Actually, I wouldn't say so.

It is your instinct. The same instinct that made Margery, the little Queen, suspicious, like you can see on the tapes. Watch yourself \(S6E10\) and look at her in the replay and see how she can smell and taste and feel the evil things that are about to come for her. And they came for her and her weak little Lauris, thanks to you, sister. And for a lot of scumbag of the city..

Sister, you must admit finally that winter came for us, too. I don't think you can fight the Starks and the Targaryen bitch on your own. When I rode north, snow fell on the capital and, I am quite sure, this night will be dark and full of terrors... and errors, on our enemies' side.

Cersei, you are always proudly telling me that you learnt from father, sitting there in your golden cloaks, my fair lady.

I leave you now to your Golden Company and to your vicious husband from the Iron Islands. When he beats your pride out of you, think of me please and know this: I do not care. At all. Think of what Viserys told Daenerys in Season One one hand to her cheek full of brotherly love in his eyes.. I tell you: Euron and the Whole Golden Company could have you, as long as I get what I finally deserve, as Kingslayer. The throne where the king sat whom I slaught. It is obvious, isn't it?

I am riding north now thinking about the fights and the whores and the Night King and I am thrilled to fight the most monstrous beasts while you betray the cause of those alive.

Forget about all I wrote before, it was nonsense and full of YOUR poisonous mind, not mine: I hate you, sister. But still, I love you. And I hope that, at the end of the Great War, we will both be alive and well and standing on the same side. I do not want to be your enemy.

[NO SPOILERS] Sansa writes to Cersei...,"This is written personally for  [u/Ralekill](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ralekill)

# Dear Cersei,

# 

we've known each other for quite a while now and I feel like we are quite close. Even though I am so far north now.

Your mind, your thoughts, what makes you happy and what makes you angry... it's like all of that is an open book to me now.

I am your little dove, remember? 

When you asked me about my bleeding in the first time sitting there next to my mother, Katelyn Stark. Do you still remember the tone of your own voice? No? I do. 

Do you still know how embaressed she was by your words and the way she looked at me in worry? You knew it and you loved every second of it. 

I can still recall the glancing in your eyes. The way you smirked at my family when we stood there in a row, when you let my father kiss your hand.

The only one who withstood you was King Robert, the one who never fathered your bastard born of incest, King Joffrey, my beloved king. 

Robert is dead now, because you killed him. My father and mother are dead now, because your family killed them.

I almost died and went through hell, at first in Kingslanding and then back home at Winterfell where your vicious servant Ramsay tortured me. Both of them are dead, I am afraid to remind you. I  even saw Ramsay been eaten up by his own dogs. Not a nice thing to look at.

Revered Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, not long ago I told a man you know all to well: I am a slow learner, but I learn.

This one can't put his fingers into any of my business anymore. We made sure of it. We, that is me and MY family, the Stark Family from Winterfell.

Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe. Leave four of them alive and you will soon be dead, unless you are on our side.

Sleep well, Lionqueen. I already sent for my faceless men to come and kill you.

Your little dove who is a white raven now

[SPOILERS] Night King theory,"Disclaimer: I'm sure someone has posted a similar theory on here at one point or another, so I apologize if it's a repeat

The Night King was actually Brandon (the Builder) Stark. As commander of the Night's Watch, he built the Wall to protect the civilized kingdoms of Westeros against the Land of Always Winter. And, being a Stark, he had greensight of course (just like the Night King in the show).

He was believed to be the prophesied Azor Ahai in the time of the war between the First Men and the Andals, and this greatly affected his ego. So he drove his sword into his wife Neesa Neesa's chest to turn it into the Lightbringer and fulfill his prophecy, but nothing happened. He immediately regretted what he did and went south to the Isle of Faces to ask the Children of the Forest for help in resurrecting his dead wife, whose body he left partially buried in the forest just beyond the Wall.

Upon reaching the Isle of Faces, the COF believed he was just another one of the no-good First Men who wanted to bring war and domination to their homeland. They drove an obsidian dagger through his heart to make him into a White Walker, hoping he would create an army with his wife that would eliminate the First Men and the Andals alike and restore peace and serenity to their land.

Now as the Night King, Bran the Builder knew he would be deemed an abomination by civilization, so he could not return to Winterfell alone - his brother, the king, would not recognize him and would have him killed on the spot.

The Night King made it past the Wall and checked his wife's burial spot, but her partial grave had been disturbed and her body gone.

He began a slow trek north, becoming accustomed to the Land of Always Winter and also to his new White Walker body. Eventually, he came across a beautiful woman in the forest who looked just like him, and he discovered it was actually his wife.

They knew that Westerosi kingdoms would not allow them past the Wall, for they would fear that they were some type of monsters. But their goal was to get back to the Isle of Faces and force the COF to turn them back into humans. Together, they abducted wildling babies and wildling adults alike and turned them into White Walkers. They built this army in case they were met with resistance on their way to the Isle of Faces.

Then began the Long Night - the Night King, Night Queen and White Walker army marched south to the Wall and pushed into Westeros. There was a massive war between Northerners and White Walkers, and it resulted in the Night Queen (Neesa Neesa) being captured. She was brought to the deepest crypts of Winterfell that - ironically - the Night King himself had built (apparently there are crypts under Winterfell that are off-limits... the Starks probably don't even know why anymore, since it's been so long since they were last opened). The White Walker army was too small and had taken too many casualties, so they had to fall back to the Land of Always Winter.

Fast-forward to the present, and the Night King has amassed a much bigger army. When he connected with Bran (Three-Eyed Raven), he realized that he was a Stark, which angered him greatly. He also knows that Jon Snow is a Stark, and that is why he has a rivalry with him in the show. The Night King holds a grudge against the Stark house because to this day, they hold his wife captive in their crypts.

SO, the Night King is marching on civilized Westeros to obtain his wife from Winterfell and march his army south to the Isle of Faces to be turned human again. After centuries (or millenia?) of exile and longing for his wife to be at his side again, he no longer sees casualties as being 'bad' per se. He rather sees everybody as a potential White Walker convert to add to his army. And it's not because he wants dominance - instead, he has become obsessed with amassing as many soldiers as possible so he can rescue his wife and make it to the Isle of Faces and be turned human again.

The Night Queen is trapped under Winterfell and no one except the Night King knows it, so that's why he's headed there. And then they'll be on their way to the Isle of Faces to turn human again. So it's one big misunderstanding that Jon, Dany and all of Westeros think that the White Walkers just want to take over the continent.

Perhaps the White Walker/undead army, including the Night King and Queen, will even help Jon and Dany overthrow Cersei at King's Landing once they have been turned - providing them with a lot of extra help.

[Spoilers] Jaime Prediction.,"This is something i've had in mind for sometime so I thought i'd post it here. In many ways it's reaching but who knows.         

Most of this is supported with info from the show, but we do know that DD are following George's vision to a certain degree, so I think it's fair that I use some of the Text as evidence.         

I wonder if Melissandre is going to grow Jaime's hand back. It sounds stupid but if she can bring and entire person back to life why not. There are several things hinting at this.             

1. Jaime and Bronn training he says ""if I had my right Hand"" Bronn replies ""Plan on growing it back?""             

2. In Storm of Swords after the bath conversation Qyburn tells the guards to bring potions for the pain. Jaime says ""Bring me the potion that gorws new hands,"". There are a ton of references to ""growing it back"" which could just be his wishfull thinking and me reading too much into it, but this is GRRM.               

3. Arthur Dayne was Jaime's roll model. In the show he is shown using 2 swords to great effect, the text he only uses one but it does mention he is ambidextrous. Jaime has become decent with his left, if he were to get his right back chances are he could mimic Dayne's technique.           

4. Qyburn's obsession with the Wight's hand. This could just be Qyburn showing his fascination, but we know Qyburn is Jaime's Designated caretaker, we know he like to try unethical experiments, we know he brought the mountain back to life, and here he is intrigued by a severed but still functional hand. If not Mellisandre could Qyburn have been wondering ""that idea I had to grow Jaime's limb back might be possible.""           

4. The Knightkingslayer theory (jaime will kill the NK) and the Azor Ahai theory are both popular right now. This would require Jaime to be much better than he is with his left. Especially in the books where he is almost useless with it.                        

5. Beric has had damn near everything restored by the ""lord of light"". If Azor Ahai is really condoned by the lord of light, It's not a stretch to think he would restore Jaime's Hand.",gameofthrones,True,1524601887,2018-04-24

[SPOILERS] White Walker Theory...,"I was just thinking away and came up with a theory. This may have been pointed out already... Maybe on the show too but I'm stupid.

But alas...

What if the Night king is a warg, just like Bran. 

It is clear that there are alot more wights than white walkers... And what if there is a reason. 

The night king only makes a white walker if the person was also a warg. And then in turn they warg into the wights.

Essentially the nihht king is controlling the whole army through several white walkers.

This theory could then play in to how the show will end.

Compared to an army of reanimated dead, the Mountain must seem pretty tame by now. I can't imagine he would be content with the machinations of Cersei, Euron, and possibly the Golden Company, even with the Mountain lurking nearby, and would soon be tempted North to research and participate.

[NO SPOILERS] Cersei responds to Sansa,"**Cersei responds to Sansa**

Little dove,

I am happy for you that you made it to your old home safely.

I always cared for you like a mother, you know that. Much better than the Tully bitch who bred you into this world like the scared little beast that she was. Nothing a Lion thinks about twice before he devours it.

They told me the Frey rats cut her worthless throat and sent our regards faithfully. Cheers, Walder.

All thanks be to the Old and the New Gods, someone took care of this rat and his breed afterwards, too. Cheers.

I would love to meet that one personally and thank him for his duty. The world is a better place without all these little shits.

You are right, Sansa. You learnt it all from me, while your bitch of a mother is... what? Dead? Oh, yes, I think that's the correct word we use to describe useless human beings.

Your mother taught you nothing in life and she is now not more dead than she was before.

I am your mother and I have always been your mother, since the day we met. Accept my mercy. The Mother bestowed it on me. And I always loved you. Like Marcella. And they took her away from me. Like you.

Sansa, my sweet little dove. There is not one day I spend without thinking about having you back with me. I would keep you in a very safe place forever where no one would ever hurt you again.

I would find you friends that are stronger than Sir Gregor, who would kill every single one who would try to come and get at you.

Come back, my sweet girl, come back into your mother's womb.

You are mine.

Cersei

[SPOILERS] Excellent chapter in 3rd book,"I just read the chapter of Samwell in ""A Storm of Swords"" where he's describing the escape from the Fist of the First Men when the Others attack. The perspective of Sam, nearly dead and wanting to die, dragging himself through the snow and remembering the events that brought home to this point, was completely engrossing. I was seriously impressed by the technique of illustrating the attack through multiple written (but mostly unsent) letters. It built up tension in the reader, we didn't know what was going to happen next and could feel Sam's fear. We could follow along as he thought they were repelling the attackers, and then when he realized they were in fact lost. Even though we only got glimpses of action (as opposed to a front-row seat like the way many battles are reported), I could totally picture what was going on.

I have almost universally enjoyed GRRM's writing throughout the series, but this chapter in particular was a masterpiece. Bravo. ",gameofthrones,True,1524722899,2018-04-26

[SPOILERS] Who will end up on the Iron Throne?,"I believe when Tyrion talked about breaking the wheel, and succession of Daenerys, he mentioned the Night's Watch system. This could be the succession system in Westeros, with the Small Council and Lords of the Seven Kingdoms casting votes.

Speculation: Dany will end up as Queen, naming Jon (Aegon) her successor. She also commands the Dothraki and Unsullied to follow Jon as their chief commander of armies. When she dies, Jon is elected King by her Council. Jon also inherits Rhaegal. (Drogon and undead Viserion fight each other to death)

He names Tyrion his hand, Sansa Lady of Winterfell and Warden of the North, and Brienne as Commander of the Kingsguard. Varys would stay on the Small Council. 

Think about how this fits. Tyrion is one of the most intelligent minds in Westeros, fit to be the Hand to Dany. Sansa is the oldest remaining Stark, and already has the role of Lady of Winterfell. Brienne has always wanted to protect a worthy and rightful King/Lord/Lady. (Renly, Catelyn, Sansa) ",gameofthrones,True,1524735116,2018-04-26

[SPOILERS] My first experience.,"I had never watched Game of Thrones, I only ever heard of it’s notorious main character killings. Years went by and I never really gave it a second thought it seemed like an alright show but not having HBO meant I could never watch it. Well 24 days ago I got the free month of HBO and watched all the current seasons. I thought I had seen good television but man was I terribly wrong. After watching the last episode I can safely say that this my favorite show. Everything from the music to the characters (and oh my are there a lot of them). I have never seen a show with so many twists and turns, I was constantly on edge and always kept hitting the next episode button. It’s been a day since I finished and it’s all I can think about. I wished I had seen it sooner,  and deeply saddened that season 8 is the last season AND that it’s coming out in 2019. I don’t really know why I made this post but this show means a lot to me. I’ve already been called a bandwagon and for that I say for good reason. From the red wedding to the slavers raid on Mereen, and to the Night King destroying the wall, there are so many reasons to love this show and I’m happy I finally experienced it.

[NO SPOILERS] An analysis of the spiritual state and mental health of George R.R. Martin,"He was the lonely kid, who has felt missing out on something for his entire life. He missed out on being the popular kid with a lot of friends, the kid who was liked by many and who received a lot of attention and acceptance, shortly put the kid that was loved.

But when you become rich and famous, you become the popular kid. Suddenly you are on the top of the world. Everyone knows you and some even worship you. Your life gets super intense and now you have so much money and connections that everything is possible. You dare to dream again. You feel young again. You are tasting the golden youth that was lost. And it is intoxicating. When you feel young, death becomes something irrelevant and distant to you.

Martin is in denial of his mortality. The real reason he has started working on multiple side projects instead of finishing A Song of Ice and Fire is to keep himself distracted from the inevitability of his death, the fact that he is an old man and might not finish his great work. In other words, he is pretending to himself that he has all the time in the world. He will have time to finish all those book series so there is no rush. When the entire world is waiting for you to do something, by procrastinating you are bargaining with death. He is saying to God \(or destiny, or the world or whatever is the equivalent in his subconscious belief system\): “You don’t dare to kill me yet, everyone wants me to live a little bit longer, the best is yet to come.”

He might say; “Oops, I accidentally wrote so much extra material that we have to split this extra book into two parts” and even think that himself but that would be part of his subconscious plan to keep him further distracted and more incomplete. By procrastinating the final book of the main series, the great completion that he subconsciously knows would fulfil his ultimate purpose, he is prolonging his own life so he can build an empire before death dares to kill him. By starting multiple side projects he is deceiving himself with promises based on a lie “I will not die”. Valar morghulis.

Martin sold his soul to fame and fortune, which is probably what most of us would have done in his place. He chose money and the fantasy of immortality over purpose and being the good guy. Fans who say: “George doesn’t owe us anything, he can do whatever he wants, we have no right to complain” are in denial of their self\-worth, because they are worshiping him as their idol \(which is exactly what George’s ego, being very powerful at this point, wants.\) Celebrities and great artists often suffer from a more powerful ego than an average person, and building an empire and denying death is what an ego wants. The extra books will also sell better now when the show is still running and globally a hot topic. The main books will sell anyway years after.

An artist who is not on an ego trip doesn’t feel like being above his/her fans and acknowledges the suffering he/she puts his/her fans through by promising them something sweet at the beginning and making them wait for more. Think about it: if you were writing a series of books for someone you cared about, for their enjoyment \(and for your own enjoyment through their enjoyment\) and they loved your books and craved for more, would you hurry up writing more? Please note that by hurrying up I don’t necessarily mean sacrificing quality, only sacrificing fantasies of perfection \(which is way more than your reader would ever require from you to be fulfilled\). By hurrying up I don’t mean writing as fast as possible, but taking the craving of your reader into consideration. By hurrying up you are thinking “this is good enough for my reader’s enjoyment”, not “this is perfect for me”. Many great artists started as good guys who got enjoyment from the enjoyment of others, but as they got some fame and fortune, their ego transformed the good guy to the great artist who desires perfection to lift his/her self\-image.",gameofthrones,True,1524776707,2018-04-26

Jamie Lannister || Flawed Redemption (GOT Tribute),[removed],gameofthrones,True,1524782184,2018-04-26
[Spoilers] Why is Jaime's skill so nerfed in the show?,"I watched Game of Thrones before picking up A Song of Ice and Fire. I'm halfway through book 4 and one of the big disparities I have noticed (among several) is the Kingslayer's fighting skill. The show mentions that he was really good before the maiming, but they don't really emphasize it that much.           

I've been surprised reading ASOIAF that he's among the best in the entire world at the time. People compare other fighters to him and even his name makes people shake in their boots. The battle's and tournaments his won are constantly menionted and he is praised even by people who despise his guts (Ned, Barristan, Robbert, Victarion). Fans of the show only (my former self included) have the Idea that Syrio, Oberyn, Jon, Ned, and Drogo are the best and that Jaime isn't that high up. That's understandable given the show doesn't emphasize his skill much but going by the Novel he's league's beyond those mentioned.  The uncontested best melee fighter in the known world, with Barristan and the clegane's being the only close contenders.             

I personally prefer it this way, it gives his character more of a reason to be the ass that he is, and makes his hand loss that much more impactful. Season 7 Euron did call him ""the best in the world"" but that's the first time he has even been mentioned in that light. Have the show creators or actors mentioned anything about why this change was made? Was it due to a lack of screen time or did they intend to change his character? Did they want him to be more sympathetic or more defined by his sister fucking than his skill? ",gameofthrones,True,1524782394,2018-04-26

"[SPOILERS]Looking at their credentials, it's kind of amazing that D&amp;D were given the reigns to the series in the first place. It makes so much more sense that their ""original"" dialogue is so terrible","I've read (like many) that one of the biggest determining factors that GRRM had in choosing showrunners is that they could figure out who Jon's real parents were. While I really respect that, because it shows that the showrunners actually care about the source material, I really wish that HBO would have had a little more care. Now obviously, I'm not part of HBO and have no idea what happened leading up to that. But I decided to take a look at IMDB, and this is what they had at that point:

- DB Weiss - 

 * Absolutely nothing. He had no directing credit, no writing credit, and the only producing credit that he had was for five episodes of a TV show called The Specials.

- David Benioff:

 * Writing credits:
   * Troy

   * Stay
 
   * The Kite Runner

   * X-Men Origins: Wolverine (yep, for reals)

   * Brothers

Benioff at least has a little credit to his name. While he did write X-Men Origins, he did also write the screenplay for Troy (which wasn't awful from a writing standpoint), as well as 25th hour, The Kite Runner, and Brothers. I haven't seen any of those, but they all seem to have at least above average reviews. But you take a look at that and just have to wonder ""why"". 

I'm sure that everyone involved had no idea that Game of Thrones would explode into the juggernaut that it is today, but they had to believe that it would at least be somewhat successful. And if that's the case, why would they hand the entire thing over to one guy with no experience at all, and another with only three or four movies? 

I'd like to believe that they had some sort of proof of writing talent. In all fairness, 25th hour is apparently based off of a book of the same name that Benioff himself actually wrote. And they've proven that they're not completely incompetent writers in terms of the show, because they wrote the ""Robert and Cersei baby conversation"" scene, as well as the ""Chaos is a ladder"" scene. Both of which did not take place in the books, so D&amp;D wrote those from scratch. But it makes so much more sense now why a lot of their ""original"" dialogue from S5 onward is so terrible. 

I know that this post is a little disjointed, I'm just kind of brain dumping here. D&amp;D aren't all bad, they did some amazing adaption work from the books. But at the same time, it just makes you sit and wonder how two dudes were given this entire thing in their laps when they barely had any experience between the two of them.",gameofthrones,True,1524803097,2018-04-27

[SPOILERS] Theories on the Night King,"So today I will be asking a very interesting question and that is, what your theories on who the Night King is? Who do you believe is the identity of the Night King? Personally I believe he is one of three people:

- Proto-Stark: as in he is some sort of descendent of House Stark.

- Proto-Stargaryen/the first child of ice and fire: so this is a theory I have and that is the Night King is the first child of ice and fire long before Jon and that a Targ came to westeros before Aegon and made love with a Decendent of House Stark, it would explain how the Night King is able to control the ice dragon this season.

- The Night's King of legend/13th Lord Commander: this theory is alittle crazy but this is sort of a counter theory I have to my Proto-Stargaryen theory, basically the person in the cave drawings and in the flashback from S6 is NOT the Night King we see in the show, the person from the cave drawings and whom we saw get turned was Bael the Bard and the Night King we see is his son and also the Night's King of legend/the 13th Lord commander with the legends about him being build on lies.

In the year 347AC, 47 years after the war of the five kings, the lords of Westeros live in fear of the lining danger from across the narrow sea in Daenerys Targaryens Grandson Rhaego II Targaryen. For the last 47 years peace has been apparent throughout the continent, ever since the peace treaty was signed by the would be king, Robb Stark King in the North and the Southern King, King Tommen Baratheon. Robb would take the young Baratheon girl Mrycella to be his bride, Tommen would take the Northern princess Sansa in exchange for peace between the two kingdoms. House Lannister was defeated with exception to Tyrion Lannister who was allowed to keep his life as also part of the peace treaty.

It was an opportunity for the writers to make something meaningful and emotional out of a character whose plotline had already overstayed its welcome, but they had to cop out because they fept like they needed to be crowd pleasers or something.

I think the ""love, true love"" is what makes the story of AA/NN  works (not just a hero and his wife). If so it is Jorah who has a true love for Daenerys. Jon and Danny relationship is not deep enough.

Also, Arya was very injured, even after Lady Crane tried to heal her. When she fell in the stairs, she started to bleed again and struggled to walk. But after bringing the Waif's face back, she continued to walk normally with her badasstitude.

WHAT IF the Waif killed Arya in the cave and took her face. She knew everything about her by playing the game of faces. She knew her list. Jaqen told her ""you are finally no one."" And by saying ""a girl is Arya Stark, and I'm going home"" she could just play her.

I don't know how many times i watched the first appearance of Lyanna Mormont in the Show. I was always wondering why Lyanna called Davos ""Ser"" in this Scene. Bear Island is in the very North of Westeros. On the contrary Ser is title which is given to Knights who believe in the faith of the seven which is only common in the south. Davos travelled with Sansa and Jon who both shouldn't have any southern friends.

It just doesn't makes sense Lyanna assuming of Davos to be from the south. If she said it of courtesy ""Lord"" would have fit more in this Scene than ""Ser"" because nothern men believe more likely in the old gods. She couldn't have know that Davos is from the South.",gameofthrones,True,1525008739,2018-04-29

[SPOILERS] Does anyone pity Theon?,"I find a great majority of people hate Theon. I find this so interesting. GRRM did such a wonderful job creating this character because it seems
he simply wrote this character so that everyone could hate him. 

Theon Greyjoy.. a person who did not  belong to any family. His father never fought for him after he was captured .. and just wrote him off. His family
couldn't care less.. so sad.  The Starks.. always reminded him he didn't belong. That he was a prisoner, in fact everyone reminded him of that. Like it was his choice. So sad.
And unfortunately, the one time he had a chance to regain his family back, he made the wrong choice. Peer pressure at its finest. So sad. What a horrible situation to be in.
Then to be taken prisoner and tortured with no pity from anyone. I mean his sister did try, but he had already given up hope. A poor unfortunate soul.
Seems like life is teaching him that he is meant for nothing but to be of service to others.
Yes Theon isn't the best person in the world because life handed him a cruel hand. 

So I guess that is where I am confused. How is it easy to hate someone like this after seeing life through his eyes?  Does anyone pity Theon?
I find myself wanting to give him pity because it seems no one has pity for him. Perhaps this is what GRRM intended to do when creating this character. Idk. Its just fantastic how he did it.

(Also, if you do hate him, thats understandable and GRRM did a great job creating a character that served this purpose.)

• Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen. She fits the role somewhat and that's the only reason her terrible acting skills aren't fully showcased (like in everything else she's done). But she's still pretty dull and monotone.


• Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon. He isn't a bad actor, but I just couldn't buy him as the once mighty and handsome warrior and conqueror who got lazy and obese over the years. The guy looks like he was born fat. Plus, the performance was too sitcom-ish. No wonder he became a meme. A MEEEME, NED!


• Whatever her name was as Shae. God, listening her talk was painful. I actually wonder if that running joke about how she got cast is true.


• Hannah Murray as Gilly. I've always found Gilly dull and uninteresting in the books and I thought the show could fix that by casting a charismatic and sympathetic actress, but they just made her even more dull and boring instead.",gameofthrones,True,1525050487,2018-04-29

(spoilers) I'd suck so much to be a commoner in Westeros...why haven't they revolted?,"Been rewatching the show lately and I've just been thinking..man the commoners really got the short end of the straw with all the events that have been happening. So there was peace for awhile but then

Roberts rebellion happened- Kings landing was sacked and lords and commoners were raped and killed alike. Less not forget probably the countless that have died during the war. Than they get 17 years of peace until Robert dies and the sadist Joffery becomes king.

Than everyone and their mother claims they're king and the war of the 5 kings start- Again commoners are probably forced to fight and start preparing to give tribute to the kingdom since summer has ended..kinda hard to do when you got lunatics like the mountain laying waste to the fields in fire.

Joffery dies and tommen runs the kingdom with the faith militant who kill people for silly things like being gay or a whore ect.

Cersie rises to the throne but not after blowing up a sept and killing thousands in the resulting blast.

So whoo the commoners must be thinking these stupid wars are over..than comes Danny with dothraki whom are lil more than zerg rushing raping savages..ohhh and shes got dragons! Burning the fields and claiming she is to rule westeros. And lets not forget the commoners aren't aware of the massive ice zombie army on their way to wreck shop.

So I always think why haven't the common folk risen up to revolt? I think it's safe to assume they outnumber any of the high lords various armies. In kinds landing alone theres half a million people. They could easily rise up and take the city in a day with sheer numbers.

I unno anybody wanna share your thoughts on how you think the commoners feel in this tale?",gameofthrones,True,1525117550,2018-04-30

[Spoilers] Robb's Bones,"What do you think the Frey's might've done with Robb's body after they were finished with desecrating it? Do you think they might've preserved his bones for future purpose? 


I think it might be a common practice among the Westerosi nobility to preserve the bones of even their enemies just in case they needed to use them in future dealings. Ned died a traitor's death, but even so, the Lannisters preserved his bones which Tyrion later offered to Catelyn as a good will gesture. Joffrey wanted to command Walder Frey to send him Robb's head - which atleast implies that Frey keeping it preserved would've been a reasonable expectation. Supposedly being a cautious man, Walder Frey might've decided to store Robb's body somewhere after his sons had had their fun just in case he has to deal with any Stark loyalists in the future. But ofcourse, he didn't bother to do the same thing with Catelyn - so who knows?


I'm not sure why it bothers me so much, but I feel like the bones being brought to the final resting place and put to peace is an important rite of mourning. It kind of gives a sense of closure - as if despite how horribly a character may have died, he is finally at peace. That Robb would be denied even that while characters like Joffrey and Tywin get state funerals seems really unsettling. The books make a big deal about this stuff too - its not just Ned, first Lady's bones are sent back to Winterfell and then so are the bones of Jory and others that Jaime's men killed in King's Landing. In fact, in his peace terms, Robb makes a point of not only asking for Ned's remains but those of his household who died as well - and he asks for them before asking for Ice. That Robb's character would be denied the catharsis of this simple courtesy seems really unsatisfying as a narrative. 


In the books, I'm hoping for a scene where after House Frey falls (and fall it must), whoever took it down finds Robb's remains and sends them North under escort. And later, another scene after Winterfell is retaken where a statue of Robb is being built for the crypts. I was expecting something similar from the show, but the show only seems to remember Robb when its time to point out how dumb he was for being betrayed and losing the war. And for the past couple of seasons, Catelyn's existence seems to have been reduced to ""mother to the Stark children"" and ""Littlefinger's character motivation"". So I don't think I can expect anything from the show.


But what about the books? You think there is hope there?",gameofthrones,True,1523584821,2018-04-12

Weren't the Starks and the rest of the Northern houses already wary of the Boltons because they flayed men alive, even when Ned Stark outlawed it? I would imagine that there were more trustworthy lords Robb could have chosen to advise him instead of Roose. Or was this just a power grab by Roose to set himself up in a position where he could eventually betray Robb if/when he felt need be.

[SPOILERS] Sansa storyline in season 8,"So, they left a few lines in seaosn 7 that maybe foreshadows that Sansa will be kidnapped in season 8. I was hoping that plot could be just silly haters talk but George loves to repeat his stories and Robert Rebelion and the tale of ASOIAF did start with a Stark girl being kidnapped.

“BLACKWATER”

Sansa: But we have guards to defend us?

Cersei: Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they’ll be the first ones out of the doors.

In S7, Cersei mentions hiring the Golden Company to 'retrieve some things that belong to her'.

“THE SPOILS OF WAR”

Sansa: You shouldn’t have run from the guards.

Arya: I didn’t run. You need better guards.

“BEYOND THE WALL”

Sansa: “I will not set foot in King’s Landing while Cersei Lannister is queen. If they want another Stark prisoner, they can come and take me.”

Brienne: It’s not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.

Sansa: I have many guards who would happily imprison him or behead him, whether or not you’re here.

Brienne: And you trust their loyalty? You trust he hasn’t been speaking to them all behind your back?

""BEYOND THE WALL""

Daenerys: ""So if all goes well I will finally get to meet your sister"", ""from everything you told me about her, she would rather murder me than speak with me"",

Tyrion: ""oh, first she would torture you in some horrible way, then she would murder you, nobody trust my sister less than I do, believe me""

So, it does seems that this theory could happen in season 8, what are your thoughts about it?

[Spoilers] S8 Cersei Theory,"I’ve had a theory recently regarding Cersei and the child she’s carrying. I think it’s possible Cersei will give birth to a boy and end up sacrificing him to the Night King, becoming the Night Queen in return. I’m not sure how this will play out in the finale, but it’s something I could see happening as Cersei is power hungry and will always want to be on the winning side. I think her child being sacrificed would really amplify that need. Cersei’s only redeeming quality is her love for her children; I think her sacrificing her last child for power would be a huge downward spiral for the arch of Cersei Lannister. I think this will cause Jamie to kill Cersei for sacrificing his son; becoming the Queenslayer in the process.

[Spoilers] Do___ and ___ ever have a direct conversation with each other?,"It just dawned on me that I don't think that Ned and Robb ever had a direct conversation with each other, at least on the show.

Ned talks with Bran after the beheading and during his archery, Ned talks to Jon when they both leave Winterfell, Ned talks to both Sansa and Arya but do we ever actually see Ned talk with Robb?  I went looking through the first few episodes again and they never seem to have direct words with each other.  

Did I miss a small convo or did the father and his first born son never actually exchange words in this story?  Given what Robb does as a result of what happens to Ned I thought there would be at least 1 scene where they talk to each other but I can't find one.

Do they ever talk to each other directly in the books?  Is this just an oddity or could it possibly have deeper meaning?",gameofthrones,True,1523643547,2018-04-13
[main spoilers] What does the Night King want?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1523647764,2018-04-13
[SPOILERS] What does the Night King want?,"The title is a main question in GoT. There are many ideas. I thought I put my own. 

The idea: the NK wants to fight Lord of the light (LL).

1.  Fire and ice are enemies to eachother. Fire is symbolised in LL and ice is symbolised in NK. (Why we haven't seen LL? I don't know. But could be that Lord of the light is not an accurate translation and ""lord"" has no gender in its original language? If yes, could it be Melisandre? Her father? Or he is just a deity. If yes, NK's god or deity must also be there. I guess ""death"" is god of NK and his army. Death is also arya's god.)

2. Two swords are going to be in the last scene: the ice and the lightbringer.  This is interesting and confusing: ice is the sword of house stark and (almost surely) NK is related to house stark. But lightbringer is about Azor Ahai who ""comes back"".  People say: Azor Ahai will be Jon Snow. Maybe or maybe not. 

3. The GoT must end and its LL and NK must ""put aside [their] enmity"". I guess a resolution (a ""song"" a peace agreement) can be like this:  the ice will be reforged and becomes the lightbringer: Azor Ahai (jon snow?) puts the ice into heart of Nissa Nissa (danny? someone from south? Arya stark? ). Nissa Nissa dies. Lightbringer is born. This sword must ""bring light"". Bran role is unclear here. 

Crazy things can happen: 

either something like light appears and finishes off NK.

Or: NK wants the ice (his old sword maybe?). He gets it and take Bran stark to kings landing and kill cersei. Bran dies and NK goes back to where he came from. Or something like that. 

Or: Bran is actually LL (unlikely) and he will be going into ghost and fights Nk.",gameofthrones,True,1523647870,2018-04-13
[SPOILERS] Prediction from the Maesters,"Just rewatched the episode Spoils of War (Season 7), and the scene where Sam enters the meeting of the head maesters stuck with me. The maesters are mocking mystics and prophecies, and someone mentions a ""madman"" who predicted the Drowned God would rise up and defeat Aegon the Conqueror. They all laugh, because the Aegon they know of lived and died, with no such events transpiring. We now know that Jon's real name is Aegon Targaryen. Perhaps he is the Aegon this seer was referring to? Or maybe he is just a madman after all. It stuck with me as a detail that was sort of highlighted in the scene, which D&amp;D often do to subtly foreshadow events to come. Perhaps this could foreshadow the impending consequences of the betrayal by the Cersei/Euron alliance. Maybe not. Thoughts?

[SPOILERS] I really am doing my best to like this show but,"I am well into season 2 but i am having trouble  finding anything intriguing or mysterious about this show. A good show should have some mystery or unpredictable changes to me. 

GOT is predictable in the sense that someone is going to get their head chopped and on to the next one and i dont care who it is. So maybe i missing to point and someone can point to the interesting part here. The story seems like the most plain and typical  ""soup opera"" you could find .. just polished with more gore and violence. Its like the writers just took 2-3 family drama and just twisted and turned it with ""throne"" to make it more ""interesting"". The story is slow af way to much useless chit-chat, i mean i am in the second season aqd  Daenerys still hasnt arrived but is starving in desert, and Khal Drogo fell ill and died from what was originally a self inflicted wound while acting bad ass, thats just ridiculously stupid where i have to laugh.  Most of the characters lack facial expression and just come across dumb. And the acting lets just say non of the cast is impressive, except maybe some of the Lannisters at times. There is really no good game changing cliffhangers making you want to turn on the next eposide. I do respect that everyone has a taste but hope some can tell me if i can except some changes giving my view so far. I really do hope so cause its just beautiful to watch GOT.

Is the only excitement about GOT who is next to get their head chopped off ? What about if i dont care about non of the characters ? 

My taste: I love Fargo Season 1 + 2, Narcos, Westworld. I guess im trying to find the level of excitement those 3 shows gave me in GOT.",gameofthrones,True,1523675925,2018-04-13

[SPOILERS] What are your biggest gripes with the show?,"Personally I dislike how they ignore how ugly the Maine characters are. Sorry but Tyrion is a handsome little shit in the show and his scar is cool. In the book he's a monster and the scar makes him look mpre hideous because he loses his nose. Same with Brienne. She's *realllllllly* ugly in the books but I think Brienne in the show  (minus her haircut) is very pretty and has a great butt. In the books she's hideous....

I think their ugliness is important. Handsome faces are easily trusted because of their attraction. Peter Dinklage has a handsome face, but Tyrion has a disgusting face and people don't trust him because he's so ugly and monstrous. I hate that this translation was lost in the books

Also the actual throne itself in the books is 1000000x more badass than the one in the show (Google it). I understand the cost and storage of a throne like that in the books is impossible, but I suppose that is the beauty of books.

[SPOILERS] What was the peace treaty?,"There was apparently a peace treaty between two parties (two gods) when the Night King was created. I like to think that, the peace treaty was

1. Between the Night king (NK) and the Lord of the light (LL).

2. And it partioned the world into North (for NK) and South (for LL). 

3. As gestures: NK gave his heart to LL and LL gave his sword (the ICE). 

4. Targaryen were protecting LL interest. And Starks were protecting NK interest. Starks men must not march south (else they die) and Targaryans must not march north (else they die). And I think it was LL who violated the treaty: he marched north with his army led by his followers. And NK decided to march south. 

 A marriage between a stark and a targaryan was a solution or a problem? 

**A** if solution: the son of that marriage is the next NK. Current NK need a replacement, who better than Jon? So NK wants to crown Jon and that's all.

Or is it as usual: a targaryan sitting on the throne (Jon) and a stark as warden of the north (bran? Bran could be next blood raven too).

For future NK, a targaryan man and a woman are needed, so danny and jon did secure survical of Targaryans. Bran role is unclear.

**B** if prolem: I see no problem.

"[Spoilers]About Jon,tyrion and Varys;the social outcasts","In the show,these main character is depicted as ""good people"" .

Varys wants to save the realm,tyrion do good things,and Jon is would-be saviour of the known world.

I wonder,why is that? Because If one is constantly called dwarf,eunuch or bastard and despised,it is more understandable that they becomes twisted or bad person.If I were them,I probably wouldn't care about the realm or don't save people.

It's because in out times it is politically and socially not accepted to depict the once-descriminated as bad ? Or,it's because the author just don't like traditional point of view? Or,it's beceuse they are just good intrinsicly(I think this is poor reasoning)? Or,it's because they have good friends/family? Or,it's just plot twist? Or,am I missing something?

I'm not against anyting.I'm just curious.

What do you guys think?

[SPOILERS] Deaths of next season,"Okay so these were going to be the results of the betting post I made last week I will leave a link to it here https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/8aldkt/spoilers_who_will_die_next_season/

but however instead I decided to instead make a post on who I think is going to die since not enough people posted on the other post and to be honest it take me to long to tally all the results. So here we go:

- All of Dany's Dragons (Drogon is killed by Viserion, Undead Viserion falls once the NK falls, Rhaegal is consumed by the wildfire at KL)

- All the Greyjoys (Yara is mercy killed by Theon, Damphair is executed by Euron, Theon dies killing Euron)

- Tormund, Ghost, Grey Worm, Yohn Royce and most of the Northern Lords (die in the first battle against the WW's)

- Beric (gives Gendry the kiss of life)

- Mel (killed by the NK)

- Qyburn (consumed by the wildfire at KL)

- The Mountain (Cleganebowl)

- The Hound (Bloodlose after Cleganebowl)

- Bronn (killed by the Mountain)

- Varys (consumed by the wildfire at KL)

- Harry Strickland (consumed by the wildfire at KL)

- Cersei (killed by Jaime)

- Jaime (sacrifices himself saving KL by setting of the wildfire and killing the Wights entering the city, basically consumed by wildfire)

- Brienne (consumed by wildfire)

- NK (killed by Jon in 1v1)

- Dany (survives childbirth but dies in battle with the NK)

- Edd and the Night's watch (the rest of the wall falls on them)

- Howland Reed (killed by the NK)

One character I am not sure on:

- Sansa Stark (I want her to live but I just keep thinking she will die next season)

The characters I think will live (or atleast sure will live):

Jon Snow, Bran Stark, Arya Stark, Nymeria and the Wolfpack, Davos, Sam, Gilly, Little Sam, Edmure, Roslin, Edmure's child, Meera Reed, Lyanna Mormont, Missendei, Tyrion, Robin, Pod, Gendry, Jon &amp; Dany's twin children, Timett, Jaqen, Daario, the Archmaesters, the Tarly woman, Jorah, and Hot Pie.",gameofthrones,True,1523724848,2018-04-14

"[SPOILERS] Think again, Tyrion is a genius! (Theory)","Hi,

Remember that horrible plot in s07e06: ""Beyond the Wall""?

My theory involves a twist that would make you think again about that plot, and about the genuinity of Tyrion's intelligence!

Tyrion's plan all along, was, after believing Jon Snow, to give him a chance to bring a sample from behind the wall. His goal was not to convince Cersei, but rather to convince ""Daenerys"". Because if the dead are real, then Daenerys should send her armies north, because they are a very serious threat that must be stopped for the survival of entire Westeros.

With that being typed, Tyrion is not a fool. He **did not** actually bet on succeeding at arranging a meeting with Cersei. That was a side-goal to hit two birds with one stone, because if Cersei agrees to meet them and accept a truce, her betrayal would be very predictable and used to Daenery's advantage to overtake King's Landing smoothly without blooshed.

(Possibly hiding a portion of the armies somewhere to march in King's Landing after Cersei marches out to finish what's left of the White Walker's Battle). ",gameofthrones,True,1523787161,2018-04-15
[SPOILERS] Could we really believe in Cersei's words?,"I have read many theories here and in other subreddits. Almost all of them take for granted that what Cersei says about Euron's expedition to hire the Golden Company was true. But... are we completely sure that Cersei told Jaime the truth about the real intentions of Euron? We don't have any other proof than her words (and we all know what Cersei's words are worth). In other circumstances, we have actually seen what was going on, in addition to being told: for instance, Tyrion telling Daenerys &amp; Co about the siege of Casterly Rock (S7E3). I think it's quite weird that the existence of such an important move relies only on Cersei's words. Could we really be so sure that Euron is actually going to Essos to hire the Golden Company?

"[Spoilers] Found something like this on r/asoiaf and thought it would be fun to bring it here. Can you guys guess the titles of next season’s episodes? And if you want to go further, also post an outline prediction for each episode.","1)  The Drowned God: Aside from getting a glimpse into Cersei, Jaime heading North, and Jon and Dany’s arrival at Winterfell, I think this episode will primarily focus on Theon, Yara(who I believe has had her tongue cut off,) and especially Euron. I refuse to believe the show would do that much disservice to not only such a vital character in the long scheme, but also easily the most evil and twisted character in the main story. Unleashing a Kraken? That would definitely make up for the corny pirate character from last season

2) The Prince That Was Promised: I think Dany is TPTWP, but that’s not why I think this will be the name of the episode. My guess is Jon’s true parentage is revealed in this episode and he’s falsely labeled as the TPTWP. More on that later. Dany also finds out she’s pregnant(I could also see this happening late in episode 1.) After the revelation of her pregnancy, Tyrion tells her there’s a small issue. He promised that Cersei’s baby would be Dany’s heir since she was believed to be barren. She’s not happy about that all. AT ALL. Thankfully, Jaime shows up at Winterfell around this time and informs them of Cersei’s true plans. Now Dany is definitely pissed. Jon reminds her of the task at hand and is able to convince her to worry about the danger coming from North soon. And as it turns out, that danger is approaching rapidly.

3) The Long Night: I think this will be the WW attack/seige/destruction/or whatever at Winterfell. Sadly, I think many will die. Even a major character. After rereading the series and picking up on what I to believe important foreshadowing, I firmly believe Arya is going to have to mercy kill Sansa (same way Lady died: sacrificed by a family member.) How exactly? Good question. If the WWs are there maybe she gets bitten by a wight and Arya ends it before too late? Hope not, that would be heartbreaking. We’ll probably see some more of Theon and Euron too. I believe Theon kills Euron but Yara dies as well. Theon becomes lord of the Iron Islands. Orrrrr Euron tries to seduce Dany and she sees right through him and sets Drogon’s flames upon him(I think this is how he’ll die in the books)

4) Azor Ahai: this I believe to be Jon. While many signs may point to Dany, she’s The Prince(ss) That Was Promised. In season 7, Melisandre told Dany that she and Jon had roles to play in the war to come. Dany’s role isn’t AA. That’s Jon. He’s the one who has to make the sacrifice to end the Long Night. Speaking of Melisandre, our favorite red priestess makes a return with some important news. Idk how the show will decide to go with this but either: A) Varys is a secret Targ himself (I think it’s pretty much confirmed he is a bastard Targ) and secretly plotting on Dany to take the throne for himself or B) Melisandre informs Dany that it was him who caused the downfall of her family by driving her father to extreme paranoia. Either way they decide to go, Dany burns Varys.

5) A Song of Ice and Fire: Climax of the Great War. Jon sacrifices Dany(😔) but not before she gives birth (don’t know when this happens. Either this episode or one of the two before.) Jon then kills NK and wights all just drop. Now all left to deal with Cersei. I’m almost certain Jaime completes the valonqar prophecy but not without losing his own life ass well. King’s Landing is definitely getting completely destroyed by a dragon. In the books I think it’ll be Dany the one to do it but since she’ll probably be dead by this point in the show, maybe Bran wargs into a dragon? I don’t see why he’d have those intentions but hey, you never know.


6) A Dream of Spring: Reconstruction after the Great War, Starts are striving (I think all survive besides Sansa,) and a Targaryen restoration who is also half Wolf (child of Dany and Jon.) Jon refuses the throne (just as his great great grandfather Aemon did as well.) No clue what he decides to do with his life though. Tyrion as regent until the latest baby Targ comes of age.

[SPOILERS] Religion of the Night king and his army,"The NK and his army are a kind of ""people"". I think they have a religion or belief or ... :

1. They can not be called living human.
2. They can not be called without consciousness. Because they respond to things around them and they act. (I call it a fuzzy state of consciousness. But I don't discuss it). And they are not another kind of animal (like dogs or ..).

3. They have an aim and are willing to do everything for it. And they indiscriminately (most of the times) kill to reach their objective. They follow something (NK being the messenger of it). And they have symbols: in the show several times they formed particular image of body parts of humans they killed.

For me these are enough to say they have a god and a religion. I think

1. Their god is ""death/hate"". Interesting that Arya said ""death"" is her god. And Hound said ""hate"" is keeping him.

2. Their god ordered them to fight another god called the lord of light (LL) who offers ""life/love"". 

3. There is another god called ""many faced god"". Is he the same as NK's god? If yes, things could be interesting: NK moves to their temple in braavos and take all the faces collected and put them on faces of his soldiers? And crown a new NK?

Do you think, NK and his army have a god? Is the great war a religious war between LL and that god? Who is serving who? Were First men serving LL and Andals serving death/hate/many faced god?

In this theory: house stark is serving death/hate and hound too,. And Cersei is serving LL (her obsession with love and life is amazing)... I want Cersei to be NK's wife to reach a lasting peace between life and death.

Are the current population aware who tgey are serving (without knowing)?",gameofthrones,True,1523815959,2018-04-15

[SPOILERS] A Theory on the Seven,"Now I have come with a new theory for you all and that is a cool theory I think I am the first to come up with (if not then someone please correct me), and that is that R'hollor, The Drowned God, the Many Faced God, The Great Other, and the Storm God are each members of the faith of the Seven. Now before you exit off thinking I am crazy here me out, as I make my points for why I believe this.

Okay so you are the Seven, The Seven are the Father, The Mother, The Warrior, the Smith, the Maiden, The Crone, and the Stranger. they are worshipped by the Faith of the Seven. So which of the Seven do R'hollor, Many faced, Drowned, Storm, and Great Other represent:

- The Father=R'hollor (because R'hollor is worshipped as a leader and the Lord of Light, and the Seven apparently represents light)

- The Mother=???

- The Warrior=Drowned God (Ironborn are warriors so that's why I see the Drowned God being the warrior)

- The Maiden=???

- The Stranger=The Many Faced God (do I even need to say why)

- The Smith=The Storm God

- The Crone=The Great Other

Now the only ones I could not find a fit for was the Mother and The Maiden which is why I only had question marks where they are. Now I do believe this theory and I think it be cool if each of the Seven were these gods I paired them with, now idk if I am the first to come up with this theory so if I am not, let me know.",gameofthrones,True,1523819503,2018-04-15

[SPOILERS] Maybe they should have focused on the South over the North after all,"And by that, I mean Stark and Targ forces should have remained fighting the War in the South over focusing on the threat in North, Cersei over the Night King. 

There has been plenty of conversation about Jon, Dany, and crew inadvertently enabling the NK's bid to cross the Wall en masse and to obtain a dragon. While there are still plenty of questions about how much of a role the Wall had in keeping the Others out, and if the NK expected or foresaw any of the events that transpired, it seems fairly clear that the Night King and his army are far more of a greater threat now. While we don't quite have enough information to say definitively yet, it may be possible that the Northern threat may have remained largely a distant menace stuck behind a magical Wall, until Jon and allies ventured North and summoned Dany and her dragons. I mean, they obviously didn't know, they are mostly in a state of ignorance about the NK and the wights. 

They could have tried to work together to shore up Dany's win of Westeros, combining her conquering instincts with Jon's natural charisma with the common folk. Of course, it is doubtful the vast majority of the North would have joined in on this excursion, but they could have remained behind to prepare for the long Winter, and training for some inevitable conflict with the Others. Struck before Cersei solidified her partnership with the Iron Bank and contacted the Golden Company, and left her with little resources at the beginning of Winter. 

They could have continued mining and crafting dragon glass, training every man, woman, and child to fight, and storing resources for Winter, but just let the Wall keep out the worst of the Others and get Westeros mostly sorted first. 

Of course, hindsight is 20/20, they lacked quite a bit of knowledge that we in the audience know, etc. etc., but I just wanted to take the opportunity to say...Sansa was right. ",gameofthrones,True,1523844242,2018-04-15
[SPOILERS] What’s your opinion about the YMBQ?,"This is not an extend text about a theory, but only some points about the women that could be the YMBQ, from Marry the Frog’s prophecy.

When we read the books we can see Margaery as a potencial option. She’s beautiful and inteligent. And she was somehow responsible of Joffrey’s death, and the distance between Cersei from power and control, including her childreen, with the help of her family, the Tyrells.

However, there’s a woman, that’s called the most beautiful woman in the entire world of ASOIAF. Daenerys has a large army and three dragons by her side. She is absolutely a threat for Cersey, once she can stole her crown and power. It’s the more logical option, no doubt.

Some people believe that Sansa could be the YMBQ. Her beauty is mencioned more than one time and, in TWOW, she’s called as “the most beautiful maid in the Seven Kingdoms”. She’s too a part of the events that lead to the death of Joffrey. She also has a connection with Jaime, who said in AFFC that “Sansa Stark is my last chance of honour”, referring to his promisse made to Catelyn Stark, after denied the request for help sent by Cersei.

When the prophecy was made, Marry said that this woman would take from Cersei all that she holds dear. And what does it mean?

Was she talking about this just as a metaphor for the power and crown that she would lose? Or when she talks about it she literally said that she would lose what she holds dear because of this person? I mean, her family/childreen, Jaime’s devotion and affection and also her power?

That’s my doubt. Cause, if this was about power, it’s quite possible that the YMBQ is Daenerys Targaryen. But if this is a literal message this would fit for other characters, once Dany has nothing personal with Cersei.

I don’t think that this would be Margaery, cause she’s dead in the series and I believe that this will happen in the books too.

The other option is Sansa, who is envolved indirectly in the death of Joffrey (the others two we don’t know how will be desenvolved in the next books) and has some kind of connection with Jaime.

What do you think? Was it literal, or was it about the power itself? Who do you think is this woman?",gameofthrones,True,1523844462,2018-04-15

"Comparisons between Stannis Baratheon and Creon, the tragic Greek king",[removed],gameofthrones,True,1523852504,2018-04-16
"[SPOILERS] Similarities between Stannis Baratheon and Creon, the tragic Greek king","Hey guys, just today I finished the series for the first time and during my time watching I noticed there are several similarities between Stannis Baratheon and Creon, the character who is (arguably) the protagonist of the Ancient Greek play *Antigone*. It is my belief that George R.R. Martin was heavily inspired by Creon when writing Stannis and his arc. Originally I wasn't going to write a post about this as I'm not the first person to notice these parallels, but the only other post about this I could find was written four years ago before the death of Stannis, and since that post was written several more details have appeared in the series that make the parallels between the two men even stronger.

Credit goes to u/BenMargarine for being the first to notice these parallels, even before they were as obvious as they are now:
https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ma95k/show_spoilers_had_anybody_else_drawn_parallels/

Instead of repeating what u/BenMargarine has already said, I will instead discuss the parallels that can be drawn from Stannis's actions in Season 5, namely the ones that lead up to his death. u/BenMargarine kindly provided a synopsis of *Antigone* in his post, but I will try to explain the story of Creon as well as I can in my points of comparison.

- **Creon has his niece sentenced to death, so does Stannis to his daughter.** The central conflict of *Antigone* entails Creon's act of sentencing his niece Antigone to die for burying her brother despite it being forbidden by law. A debate that takes place over the course of the novel is if Creon did the right thing in sentencing Antigone, and a similar conflict can be seen in Stannis and the characters around him when he sentences his daughter Shireen to be burnt at the stake. Both men have to face the decision to execute their family members in order to uphold another value, and both men decide to do so.

- **Sentencing their family member results in the suicide of others close to them.** By sentencing Antigone to die, Creon causes his son Haemon, who loved Antigone, to kill himself. This crushes Creon. Additionally, and more importantly, Creon's wife Eurydice then kills herself after hearing of the loss of her son, cursing Creon as she does so. After Shireen has been killed, Stannis's wife Selyse also kills herself the very next day, distraught by the loss of her daughter.

- **Both men sacrifice their family members in order to uphold values they believe to be true.** Creon sentences Antigone to die because he believes, as the new king of Thebes, he must uphold the law of man no matter who may be guilty. Stannis sentences Shireen to die because he believes that doing so will result in him successfully gaining the Iron Throne, and to do so must uphold the wishes of the gods. Interestingly, Creon and Stannis's values appear to be the opposite: Creon strongly believes that the laws of man means more than the laws of the gods, while Stannis does terrible things in order to honour the supposed wishes of the gods, rather than sticking to his own beliefs that human sacrifice is wrong.

- **Both eventually turn out to be wrong, and realise too late.** Creon eventually realises his mistake and sets out to bury Antigone's brother Polynices himself and then prevent Antigone from dying, but does so too late. By the time he arrives to save Antigone, she has already hung herself instead of starving to death, which subsequently causes his son and wife to kill themselves as well. Stannis realises he is wrong the morning following the death of Shireen, and again realises after the act has already been completed. Stannis realises he is wrong when, despite Melisandre's promises, half his men desert his army and his wife kills herself, but by that point it is already too late to undo his own actions.

- **They both ignore those who argued against them.** Creon ignores every person who tries to convince him to change his mind, from his son Haemon to the prophet Tiresias, even if he once trusted them. Stannis does the same, almost killing Davos Seaworth whom he once named his Hand and sending him away when it came time to kill his daughter.

Personally, I love the two characters and their tragic outcomes. Stannis Baratheon is my favourite character in the series. There are interesting differences between the two men, such as Stannis being murdered while Creon is left alive, but I am very sure that George R.R. Martin took heavily from the arc of Creon in order to write the downfall of Stannis. What do you guys think?",gameofthrones,True,1523853165,2018-04-16

"[SPOILERS] Ice and Fire are life and death, and what I think that means for GRRMs 'bittersweet ending'","I am a show-watcher with book knowledge from reading analysis and theories online, so I thought it more appropriate to post here than on /r/ASOIAF

A Song of Ice and Fire is fundamentally a story about the cycle of life and death. There are many theories that touch on this or go into detail extreme detail about it. Basically, it is pretty clear that life and death are the two opposing mythical forces that underpin the central underlying conflict of the story. The various religions and mythologies of the story represent different interpretations of either a 'god' of life, a 'god' of death, or both.

The Many Faced God is the god of death, representing sacrifice, tribute, payment, and loss. Other interpretations of this include the main religion in Westeros, the faith of the Seven, and the religion of the Iron Islands, the worship of the Drowned God. The Ironborn even say they 'do not sow', indicating they do not spread life. The White Walkers are agents of the god of death.

The Red God is a god of life. The red god represents warmth, resurrection, rebirth. I believe that the religion of the North, the 'Old Gods', is actually also an interpretation of the Red God, rather than an interpretation of the god of death. The Old Gods are associated with wierwood trees and the children of the forrest. Trees and plantlife almost always represent life in mythology. The Old Gods manifest in ways that seem to act in opposition to the White Walkers. Also, both the Old Gods and the Red God facilitate visions, the old gods through Greensight, and the Red God through fire magic. It is possible that the 'fire magic' is a meaningless ritual that followers of the Red God have come to associate with Greensight.

A snag in this theory is the fact that the children of the forrest created the White Walkers. Surely, the white walkers and the children are from the same magical family, then right? I believe that there are three possible explanations for this:

1. The White Walkers were corrupted by death. In this explanation, the children created the White Walkers as agents of life (to defend Westeros from the death and destruction of Men), only to have that plan backfire and for the white walkers to become corrupted by the god of death to become his agents. This is the most obvious, but least compelling of the three explanations IMO.

2. The God of Life asked the God of Death to destroy men. The children of the forrest (as agents of Life) created the Walkers through a pact with the God of Death. Life created Death to destroy Men. In this scenario, Men represent Life that brings death. Men are the ultimate corruption of the magic of the god of life.

3. Death didn't exist at all until the God of life needed it. The god of life didnt make a pact with death, the God of life CREATED death to destroy the First Men. Before Men, the children of the forrest lived in a sort of undying 'garden of eden'. Life created death to remove the corruption of Men from this perfect world. Death, of course, could not be controlled. Men are the balance between life and death, and the Children of the Forrest turned to Men to undo their mistake in creating life. The end result was that Men found balance between Life and Death.

I believe the third theory is the most compelling. It paints a picture of a world corrupted, but in balance. It reveals an ending that is not perfect. We all but know that this story will end in balance. But if balance is the natural way of things, then the restoration of balance almost seems too perfect an ending for GRRM. Instead, we are presented with a sort of 'paradise lost' scenario. The world was perfect before life created death, but is has been corrupted and can never go back. Instead, we find bittersweet balance.",gameofthrones,True,1523872147,2018-04-16

[SPOILERS] Land Somewhere Else,"In my opinion, the Targaryen landing on Dragonstone during Season 7 was a horrible choice. Small, barren, and lacking any major ports for the massive armada Daenerys had brought, but of course, ""birthright""

Could Dorne, or even possibly Oldtown have been better landing spots for the Targaryen army? Landing in Oldtown could give her claim over the throne more legitimacy if she has the septon in the Starry Sept crown her as Queen (as the Great Sept... well you know). Plus, even if they lose their navy, Daenerys already has more than a hundred thousand soldiers landed on Westeros, and in a prime position to strike the Stormlands, the Westerlands, and even the Crownlands itself.

[NO Spoilers] Is George R.R. Martin waiting for the series to end?,"Hey folks, I had a theory the other day that seems a bit far-fetched but also I could see it being true. Does anyone think GRRM is waiting for the tv series to end before releasing anymore books? There could be a few reasons this is the case

1. He wants the book series and tv series to end in the same way for consistency. Of course he knows the ending as I'm sure he is a large part of the planning of the TV series, but maybe he wants to see how the end plays out or something like that

2. He may not want to spoil anything for anybody, including show watchers and book readers. Releasing the books early before the show ends would spoil it for many people watching the show 

3. HBO may have something in his contract preventing him from releasing any spoilers about the show. Releasing the books before the end of the show may violate this somehow, even though everything is his creation. I feel like this could be the most plausible explanation, but at the same time hype from the book ending may drive more people to watch the show so who knows

[SPOILERS] [LEAKS] My Season 8 Predictions so far.,,gameofthrones,True,1523883273,2018-04-16
[SPOILERS] My Season 8 Predictions,"This is an incomplete list of my predictions for Season 8. There are some surprising ones, but *a good portion of these* I have good reasons to suspect they are true.  Now, two of these are actual leaks but I won't say which ones they are. Note: some of these aren't expected to be in the order presented.

 - NK sacks Winterfell.

 - Melisandre uses magic to fight back the NK for the time being.

 - Jaime dies, after fighting, in the arms of Brienne.

 - Cersei miscarries.

 - Sam discovers the secret to Valyrian Steel.

 - Either something happens to Longclaw or Jon gives J-Bear longclaw because he needs his Valyrian Steel sword (signifying forgiveness on what J-Bear has done, much like what Jon did to theon).

 - Sansa is kidnapped by Cersei during some conflict between the two sides so Cersei has leverage on Jon.

 - Tyrion plans Cersei's assassination with Arya using Jaime's face.

 - Arya takes out Cersei.

 - The Hound crosses paths with Gregor. Cleganebowl happens. The Hound obviously wins.

 - Boatsexbaby (?)

 - Daenerys dies fighting the Others and becomes a Wight/Other. Very possibly another dragon gets taken down and becomes turned as well. (Cersei's conversation with Jaime before he left seems to suggests the latter part is true).

 - With the abundance of Valyrian Steel, and Jon without a weapon, Gendry reforges Ice from Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail to remake the Stark ancestral sword. Jon will use this to fight the Others.

 - Jon kills Wight/Other Daenerys in some battle.

 - The AOTD will be lured into King's Landing.

 - Someone blows a horn to signal to light the fuse.

 - The Hound will light the wildfire cache under King's Landing, blowing up a significant amount of the AotD.

 - Battle for the Dawn between what's left of the AotD and the living.

 - Jon slays NK.

 - Jon, who has been given his spots as LC of NW and KotN through the means of the choice of the people and has inherited the throne through birthright and not by the people's choice, and Tyrion, who holds onto Daenerys' vision of breaking the wheel that crushes the people below them, will put into place a crowned republic/elected crown with checks and balances and several other important changes to end the Game of Thrones.

 - Tyrion will be elected as King and Sansa will sit by his side as Queen to rebuild Westeros after the Long Night. Whether or not they have a strictly political marriage or if they actually do have a consummated marriage in the end is beyond me.

 - Jon will return to the North with boatsexbaby to raise him/her as Ned raised him.

Some inconsistencies are in here obviously, but I have good reason to suspect that a good portion of these are true.  Not most, but a good portion.",gameofthrones,True,1523883434,2018-04-16
"[SPOILERS] In the North, Season 1 (in verse)","Hi,  
I thought some of you might appreciate a bit of versifying, so here is part of Season One, in ballad metre. It covers the story in the North, up to about the time Catelyn goes south to warn Ned. If you like this sort of thing, I have all of of Seasons One to Seven available.   

A Song of Ice and Fire – Series One: A Game of Thrones  
===================================

Prologue  
---------

*...and fifteen peaceful years have passed*  
*since rebels' war was won,*  
*since death of mad Targaryen king,*  
*since King Baratheon.*  

Meanwhile, in the Seven Kingdoms...  
-----------------------------------------

In Westeros he ruled (he thought),  
King Robert did, well fed.  
But uncocksure, he sought the help  
of Eddard Stark; called Ned.  

King Robert's Hand had died of late.   
Lord Jon Arryn in pain  
passed on. By whom we cannot say  
he was so cruelly slain.  

A man named Will, deserted from  
the Rangers, said he'd seen  
the walking dead beyond the Wall,  
but who knew where he'd been.  

Lord Eddard Stark considered that  
and said, It's just a myth.  
The Walkers went extinct long since,  
and lopped Will's head forthwith.  

The Stark kids found a Direwolf bitch  
dead cold beneath a log.  
They took its pups, adopted them,  
as Ned said, Be more dog.  

Then Rob the King rode far oop north.  
With Winterfell in sight,  
he paused with punctuating fart  
and said, Let's all get tight.  

Rob's erstwhile comrade Ned gave in  
when Rob said, Be my Hand.  
The King rejoiced to think that with  
Ned's help he'd tame the land.  

All unbeknownst to none but knew,  
the twins up in the tower,  
were bonking in the way of dogs,  
and at it for an hour.  

We'd call it incest, what they'd done,  
but they pled sibling love,  
and caught by Bran in flagrante,  
dispatched him with a shove.  

Poor Bran was broke and comatose.  
The Starks were all distressed.  
Yet Ned and girls still rode off south,  
with Bran prescribed bed-rest.  

Prince Joffrey was a teenage brat  
betrothed to Sansa Stark,  
whose sister caused a wee affray  
that ended Direwolf's bark.  

When Arya sparred with butcher's boy,  
the bully drew his sword.  
Her Direwolf bared its teeth on wrist  
and bit the little coward.  

That Cersei's wrath was seen to show,  
was telling, while the son,  
although the firstborn bound to rule,  
was cruel; ask anyone.  

Nymeria fled the scene, which meant  
that Lady faced instead  
a proxy death; a sacrifice,  
administered by Ned.  

Bran hadn't fallen to his death,  
but for his Direwolf's teeth,  
he would've been disposed of by  
a dagger's lifeblood thief.  

Assassin lost his throat to wolf  
as Catelyn faced him game.  
A long, blonde hair from in the tower  
suggested who to blame.  

Awake, but with no memory,  
Bran, left to lie in bed,  
saw Catelyn (Mum) rush off darn sarf  
to tell the tale to Ned.

[Spoilers] question about religions.,"In one of the seasons, cersei empowers the faith of the seven gods, which results in the faith militant. These people are very hostile to those who are sinners in their eyes.
 My question: how did they react to Rhlorr's followers in the seven kindoms? And how did they react to the more 'native' religions of westeros those of the Old Gods and the Drowned God? Did they just leave followers of other religions alone?

[SPOILERS] Lady Stoneheart book predictions.,"Lady Stoneheart is sort of an interesting character in the books considering how straightforward her story trajectory appears which by all accounts appears to be ""use the BTWB to kill the Freys and anyone connected with them standing in their way regardless of their connection to The Red Wedding or the ""death"" of her family."" Perhaps I'm wrong, but that seems to be the general consensus of what her character is going to do, however George likes to set things up as an obvious storyline and then surprise readers in various ways and that's what I want to discuss, how might George surprise us with this character?

Stoneheart seems to be sort of an exception to the rule that all characters are morally gray, has she purposely been set up as a character that is black and white, motivated only by revenge and malice so that it can be revealed that there is far more to her than that? Or has she been set up as Cat, character motivated by all the normal things, love, ambition, hate, etc so that we can see her become a monster later? Maybe this change is so we can see a similar redemption arc to that of Jaime and Theon. After all, the audience is meant to be conflicted about a character who is killing characters that are largely uninvolved with Rob and Cat's death and horrified by her when she attempts to kill Brienne and Podrick. It's difficult to say whether Stoneheart even fully knows what she's doing given her rather zombified like state, will she get any chapters as Stoneheart? Perhaps she will regain some consciousness and memories enough to warrant chapters and change the direction of this character?

What do you guys think? If George chooses to surprise us with Lady Stoneheart, how do you think he will go about doing so?",gameofthrones,True,1523897377,2018-04-16

"[SPOILERS] What reunions will we see, and which will be off screen?","With only 6 long episodes left, and time speeding by at break neck speeds within even one episode, it is inevitable that some reunions will occur off screen and without much of a mention. Especially since we are on the verge of so many of them in Winterfell and eventually King's Landing.

Which ones do you believe the writers will want to show and/or feel obligated to present to the audience?

Will show:
Arya and Jon, I just can't imagine that being skipped.

Bran and Jon, for the same reasons as above, with the addition of Bran needing to pass along some critical information.

Sam and Jon, and I think this will happen at the same time as his reunion with Bran.

Sansa and Jon. She will be there with the other Starks for one big Stark reunion. The writers will likely start the Sansa and Dany fighting for Jon's personal identity struggles very early on.

Hound and Sansa. I think Brienne not even mentioning Sansa to the Hound in S7 (at least onscreen) was to set up for an awkward yet poignant reunion situation in the show.

Jaime and Tyrion. Sure they reunited recently, but this will be a coming together reunion...assuming Jaime survives the initial encounter with all people in the North. He likely will.

Offscreen:
Sansa and Tyrion. Unfortunately,  I don't think we will see much of this reunion interaction.

The Hound and Arya. We will see them interact for sure, but that initial reunion will be skipped. I think the Hound and Brienne talk about Arya in S7 was it.

Theon and most everyone, with the possible exception of Sansa or Jon. His potential return to Winterfell (if he does, that is) will focus on confronting his demons and his inner Reek.

Jorah and House Mormont. I think it possible Jorah dies early on to protect Dany or Jon for Dany, and I don't know if the writers will have time to do that reunion first. 

Plenty more I am not thinking about right now, but will add to comments as more come to mind.

[SPOILERS] More Season 8 Predictions (Different from what I've seen),"I've seen a few prediction threads in here, but none match my predictions, so I post these here as future claim chowder and with the hope they stimulate discussion. I have no foreknowledge of the season, but am basing these predictions on what I would do if I were in the writer's room for season 8, trying to create the most satisfying endgame possible for every major character that still feels fully on-brand for what people have come to expect from Game of Thrones. This means that there have to be some shocking deaths and an ending that is probably less bleak than GRRM intended.
  
Predictions (in roughly chronological order):  
- Cersei's threat is seemingly neutralized early in the season due to our heroes finding out about her plan and the threat of the white walkers increasing significantly.  
- Euron kills Yara, Theon kills Euron, and then Theon hopefully dies because come on put him out of his misery already.  
- Jon dies killing the Night King, and does so with at least a couple episodes remaining in the season.  
- After Jon dies, Daenerys dies shockingly in a scene where her death is not at all expected (with at least a couple episodes also remaining).  
- With the threat of the white walkers neutralized and Jon and Daenarys dead, it seems that the darkest possible timeline has won, with Cersei re-emerging to tighten her grip on the kingdom and killing several major-ish characters over a couple episodes (Gendry comes to mind).  
- Melisandre and Varys die during a failed scheme to undermine Cersei.  
- The Mountain kills the Hound in Cleganebowl, and Arya avenges him by killing the Mountain.  
- Jamie kills Cersei and is forgiven by Bran, almost completely redeeming his character (and maybe ending up with Briene, or more likely dying beside Cersei in a kind of Romeo and Juliet situation).  
- Sansa becomes Queen (or some more democratic version of that) of the seven kingdoms with Arya and Sam Tarly by her side.  
- Tyrion is either killed by Cersei or lives to be an advisor to Sansa.

[Spoilers] So I just saw the finale of Season 7 and I was just hoping for some quick clarification,"So we finally see that Jon is actually a Targaryen. He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, the former of which died at the hands of Rob Baratheon after he thought Lyanna was abducted by Rhaegar and killed him at the Battle of the Trident. Now here's some quick questions I have:

1. Does this mean that Jon is technically the heir, or is Daenerys since she's older?

2. Doesn't this make him Daenerys' nephew? I mean I know incest is a running theme in the show but I'm just trying to get the lineage straight.

3. What do you think would be different if, in his dying moments, Rhaegar actually told Robert that Lyanna's child was his own?",gameofthrones,True,1523923218,2018-04-16
[SPOILERS] Why I'm Falling Out of Love With GoT,"**1.) It's devolved into a traditional fantasy**  What made GoT so great from seasons 1-4 was how it was so grounded in reality. You won the game of thrones through deception, cunning, and political maneuvering. Baelish, Tywin, Olenna etc. were all experts at playing the game. Now you win the game win the game with dragons (Daenerys and the Night King) and have to fight ice zombies. So run of the mill.  **2.) Actions Don't Have Consequences Anymore**  In early seasons, every miscalculation had consequences. Eddard showing his hand to Cersei in season 1 got him killed. Robb refusing to marry a Frey got his wife, his direwolf, his mother, and himself killed. Now, Jon can fall into a frozen lake surrounded by the army of the dead and survive. Jaime can charge straight at a fully-grown dragon and survive. Jon can be about to lose the Battle of the Bastards and have Nights of the Vale show up right on time. Again, it's become a traditional fantasy in that the main heroes escape death far too often.  **3.) There are no more grey characters**  With the exception of Eddard and Joffrey, no character in the early seasons was wholly good or wholly evil. Baelish, Varys, Jaime, Stannis, the Hound etc. Now the characters are black and white. The good Targaryens, good Lannisters, and good Starks fighting the evil ice zombies, with the evil Lannisters plotting against them.  Just my thoughts, let me know what you think

Sure Olly never could see the bigger picture, but he was a kid and that fact alone just justifies all of his actions (Not to say that being a kid justifies your wrong doings, looking at you Joffrey.) I also saw it as a big moment for Jon as he still saw it fit to execute him for treason, a very loyal and just move on his part, but one that also paints him in the wrong.

[Spoilers] Probably a long shot but it would be so freakin cool if Sansa....," If Sansa either gets kidnapped trying to free Jon from kings landing, or just gets kidnapped in general like everyone thinks. It would be epic if Cersie tried to make her write a note to the North just like in Season 1 and Sansa refused to cooperate this time to really bring her character arc full circle. Cersie desides to put her to death just like ned only this time right before she is beheaded Arya takes off her face of the executioner, and Danny shows up with her Dragons and most of the north is there to take kings landing. Arya can then behead Cersie just like her father was. (Arya to Sansa in S7: You passed the sentence, I was just the executioner.) Turns out it was all a set up by Sansa in the first place. It's a nice redemption for Ned's execution and a perfect was to introduce a surprise attack for us as an audience. I know it probably wont happen but it would be an epic thing to watch.

Longclaw: Jon Snow's Mormont family blade, which gen has killed several White Walkers with.
Petyr Baelish's dagger: held by Arya Stark. I would be surprised if she directly fights a Walker though.
Widow's Wail: Joffrey's sword, held by Jaime lannister. Since they went out of their way to remind viewers Jaime now has this blade, I suspect that is a Chekhov's Sword and he will be using it soon.
Oathkeeper: Widow's Wail's sister sword, held by Brienne of Tarth. 
Heartsbane: the Tarly family sword, stolen by Sam Tarly. Again, like Jaime's sword, I can't imagine they would have included that whole plot line in season six if there was no intent for Sam to ever use the sword.

"[SPOILERS] A crazy connection between ""Blackwater"" and ""Second Sons"" that predicts Cersei's fate.","Many of you know Cersei's valonqar prophecy of how she the valonqar (little brother) is going to wrap his hands around her throat and choke the life from her.  There is something interesting I only recently made a connection to.

In this first clip Cersei tells Margaery about the history of House Reyne and ""The Rains of Castamere"":

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDl-H8wNJ18. 

Cersei says ""And now the rains weep o'er his halls, and not a soul to hear"" is a reference to the Reynes bodies being hung high at Casterly Rock (""now the Reynes weep o'er his halls"").

The Second clip Bronn sings the Rains of Castamere with the Lannister men:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDl-H8wNJ18

GRRM directed this episode so foreshadowing is to be expected.

Bronn's singing starts at the end of Cersei's scene where Cersei is the focus of the shot.  The scene cuts to a hallway as the men continue singing, and as soon as they get to ""but now the rains weep o'er his halls"" it focuses in on a hanged man.

So the valonqar's hands choking the life from her might be a noose.",gameofthrones,True,1524073238,2018-04-18

[SPOILERS] - Possible returns and GC theory for S8,"A lot of the issues concerning the Golden Company depend on if the show is speeding up or slowing down travel time or what could be happening off screen.

If the travel time is slow there could be some great options.

1. The Gold.  Yes, the gold from high garden was given to the Iron Bank but most banks like to get gold in their vaults before making a new loan.  A small number of ships sailing the gold to the IB could be intercepted by Theon or taken by Salladhor Saan.  I can't imagine that a pirate wouldn't be interested in getting that gold.  If the gold doesn't make it to the IB, they could cancel the loan to hirer the Golden Company.

2. Sea Battle.  Davos gets Salladhor Saan to fight against the Iron fleet backed by dragons.  The battle could happen before or after the GC is picked up.  If the GC is on the ships they could turn against the Iron Born once they see the dragons and give the Iron Fleet to Danny.

If time is running quickly I think there are two interesting options.

3. Danny visits IB.  The IB doesn't want to back a looser, so if Danny rides a dragon to the IB it would be a very impressive way to start a discussion that would end the IB support of Cersei.  Also, the history of Bravos should make it easier for them to support ""The Breaker of Chains.""

4. Jorah to the rescue.  Jorah sails or flies to meet with the GC to convince them to support Danny because she is going to win and she is a Targ.  The S7 Histories and Lore confirmed that Jorah fought for the GC and it's Targ founding so it should be hard for the GC to fight against Danny.

These ideas depend on either the GC either not having officially signed on to fight for Cersei, or the GC is fighting for who pays them i.e. the IB.

[SPOILERS] Westerosi equivalent of the Super Bowl,"Here's an idea that the venerable Mr. Martin doesn't seem to have thought about including in his version of the history of middle earth.

Apart from the jousting contest or melee in the first series, there hasn't been any sporting event portrayed. It's as if in the medieval-like period of Martin's history, people don't play sports. That's unlikely to have been the case in 'reality' and the omission is surely just because there's no plot line to support a sport being played.

However, if there was a medieval version of something like American Football (maybe the Hawick Ba' Game on a grand scale, played with the severed heads of slain enemies instead of a leather ball), can you imagine Beyonce singing The Rains of Castamere in the interval?

[SPOILERS] How an Icelandic Saga might predict Game of Thrones,"First up, [here's](http://sagadb.org/hrafnkels_saga_freysgoda.en) the Saga. It's an interesting read, though difficult to get into if you're unfamiliar with sagas. Nevertheless, I recommend giving it a read.    

So here's a quick, quick summary of the story (apologies if some names are different; I read it in another language):   
&gt; A man named Hallfreðr (who traveled to the foreign country, Iceland) has a dream which causes him to relocate his family - his wife and son named Hrafnkell. Following the death of his father, Hrafnkell establishes rule over the region. Hrafnkell's family is very religious and a symbol of their religion is the horse Freymane. When a shepherd disobeys Hrafnkell and rides Freymane, Hrafnkell kills him. This causes the man's family, especially a man named Saam, to revenge his death and drives Hrafnkell off the land, Saam then rules the region. For many years Saam rules until suddenly Hrafnkell murders his uncle and wins back the ""throne"".

I'm sure a lot of you have already picked up on some similarities, but I'm going to give a rundown of my personal findings.  

* *The family of Hrafnkell moved due to a prophetic dream, which resulted in the family prospering.*   
This mirrors the story of House Targaryen, whose ancestor moved to Dragonstone following the dream of a daughter, saving them from the Doom of Valyria   
* *The family is very religious, reflected in the horse.*    
This is also similar to House Targaryen which has a history of obsession with prophecy relating to fire. A reflection of their religion is their dragons, much like the horse, Freymane, is a reflection of Hrafnkell's. (Freymane literally means Freya, a Nordic goddess, horse)    
*  *Hrafnkell kills a shepherd which leads to the shepherd's family to take up revenge.*    
This is similar to the Mad King killing Brandon Stark, which basically results in House Stark starting the rebellion. (To be real with you, I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate to say, but it's definitely an important moment which leads to the same thing in both stories)   
* *The shepherd's family goes around pleading their case to other families in hopes of them joining them. He enlists the help of a friend or family member (honestly, I got lost there. Sagas have complicated character backgrounds, but it doesn't really matter), Saam, who ends up leading the ""fight"" and takes the ""throne""*   
This is like the Stark family rallying the houses of Westeros alongside house Baratheon, with Robert Baratheon taking the Iron Throne at the end of it all.   
* *Saam lets Hrafnkell live and allows him to live in exile, this leads to Hrafnkell eventually overthrowing Saam.*   
While Robert Baratheon definitely doesn't let the Mad King or Prince Rhaegar live, he does eventually (on his deathbed) allow Daenerys to live. This is where we get into predictions based on the story. According to this parallel, Daenerys (or House Targaryen, maybe Young Griff) will win back the Iron Throne.    
I would also like to add the fact that Saam systematically burned down Hrafnkell's churches, which is very similar to what the First Men did to the Weirwood trees of the Children of the Forrest - though this doesn't tie into the rest of the theory, it could have served as one source of inspiration for George R. R. Martin, if he read this saga.   

This leads me to my final point which is that George R. R. Martin is a history nerd, capital N. It is well known that a lot of elements from Game of Thrones were inspired by historical events. It's not far-fetched to assume that he knows about Icelandic sagas and might have read this one.   
I don't believe everything from this story is going to be mirrored in Game of Thrones, but I couldn't help but notice the similarities. Personally, I think George might have been inspired by this riches to rags to riches story as well as the religious imagery, although that is more a historical fact than it is specific to this story.   
I can't wait to hear someone call me an idiot because everyone knows George based House Targaryen on Hrafnkell's family, and to be fair, I didn't google this before writing this, so I might just have wasted a lot of time with this, but I just found it very interesting.   

I would love to hear if anyone else finds any similarities between the stories.",gameofthrones,True,1524176056,2018-04-19
[SPOILERS] Ice &amp; Fire: the Night King &amp; the Lord of Light,"I'm sure by now that everyone has read the ""Bran is the Night King theory"", but if not, I'll link it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6vifi4/main_spoilers_the_brannk_theory_explained/)

There's also the alternative theory that Bran is the Lord of Light, which I'll link [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4itr7s/everything_bran_is_the_lord_of_light/)

As you can see there is definitely some overlap in both theories, suggesting that Bran is influencing past events that are highly relevant to the plot, etc. Is is possible that both are true? Could Bran be both the Night King and the Lord of Light, battling himself for thousands of years in some weird, complicated time-traveling plot? Is Bran the song of ice and fire?

""I've always agreed with William Faulkner—he said that the human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about. I've always taken that as my guiding principle, and the rest is just set dressing."" - George RR Martin.

If Bran was both the Night King and the Lord of Light, it would certainly embody the concept of the human heart in *literal* conflict with itself.

Jojen said that Bran was the only thing that mattered. And the rest... is just set dressing.

If he had taken Jon’s advice and kneeled, he wouldn’t have just lost his pride - that decision would have caused a complete end to the Wildling surviving population. Kneeling meant that the Wildings would join Stannis.

_____________

&amp;nbsp;

In season 3 episode 3 of Game of Thrones, a miracle happens to Podrick Payne. Tyrion gave Podrick a gift at Littlefinger’s brothel for his loyalty at the Blackwater; a session with three of Littlefinger’s best prostitutes. Podrick returns from his gift and gives Tyrion back the money and when Tyrion protests Podrick replies that the prostitutes refused his money. After some questioning, it’s revealed that the money was not accepted because the virgin Podrick was so stunning in bed that the pleasure was worth more than the gold for the girls.  

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02QgSGH5mQA

&amp;nbsp;

This has become a legendary event in the show and in the fandom as well. Podrick has been hailed as the prophesized “God of Tits and Wine” Tyrion longed to meet, his member hypothesized to exceed even Tormund’s, and given more titles than the King of Westeros for his noble deeds in bed. But, are those titles and accolades deserved? Is Podrick actually the Azor Ahai of sex come again? I’m here to tell you no. Podrick is not the Lord of Orgasms, instead a pawn in the game of chess that is King’s Landing.

&amp;nbsp;

The first thing to keep in mind with the prostitute’s refusal to take Tyrion’s money is the context of the episode this happens in. The episode, “The Walk of Punishment”, is after the Battle of Blackwater. Tyrion has been demoted from Hand of the King to Master of Coin by the returned Lord Tywin. The reason Tyrion, Bronn, and Podrick are at Littlefinger’s brothel is collecting the royal ledgers from the previous Master of Coin Petyr Baelish. We learn later in the episode that Littlefinger has been taking out enormous loans from Tywin Lannister but also, more importantly, the vicious Iron Bank of Braavos. As Tyrion unravels the ledgers more, he eventually learns that Littlefinger has been spending most of the Crown’s money financing his own personal business ventures.

&amp;nbsp;

What this means is that Littlefinger, at this moment in the brothel, is handing over proof of his corruption and possible crimes against the Crown to Tyrion, one of the smartest people in King’s Landing. And he has to do it smiling knowing what enormous danger he is in if Tyrion  catches on to his schemes. What he needs is a spy that will tell him exactly how much Tyrion has uncovered so that Littlefinger can evade justice. However, Littlefinger has no insights into Tyrion’s inner circle at this moment. Now let’s go back to the sequence of events with Podrick.

&amp;nbsp;

When Tyrion arrives, the first person he meets at Littlefinger’s brothel is Ros, the prostitute from Winterfell that Tyrion had so much fun with in the first season. She attempts at charming Tyrion then Pod and is rebuffed by both. With the context above with the danger Tyrion represents, having Ros front and center and working on Tyrion is a smart move from Littlefinger. He’s attempting a honey pot on Tyrion which is when you have one person feign sexual and/or romantic interest in another hoping they confide in your agent. Ros has a prior positive relationship with Tyrion and is an ideal candidate for this. 

&amp;nbsp;

The initial honey pot fails but Ros’ interest in Podrick as well is telling with what happens next. With this is mind, let’s look at the dialogue in the scene.

&gt;“They wouldn’t take it my Lord” - Podrick

&gt;“Maybe they were trying to curry some favor with the new master of coin” - Bronn

&gt;“Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They’re happy enough to take it when I give it to them.” - Tyrion

&gt;“What did you tell them?”  - Bronn

&gt;“I didn’t tell them anything”  Podrick

&gt;“What did you do to them” - Tyrion
 
&gt;“Lots of things”  Podrick

&gt;“And they seemed to like these things?” - Tyrion

&gt;“Yes m’lord”  Podrick

&gt;“Of course they seemed to like it, they’re paid to seem to like it”  - Bronn

&gt;“Only they weren’t paid” - Tyrion

&gt;“What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much he gave them the time for free?”  - Bronn

&amp;nbsp;

What we should be doing in this scene is listening to Bronn, he is rightfully skeptical of Podrick’s story. He guesses that the prostitutes were faking in an effort to get at Tyrion somehow. Then he asks if they pumped Pod for information. And finally notes that great prostitutes are actresses, they can fake pleasure easily. Bronn correctly identifies that even though Pod is only a squire, being a squire to Tyrion makes him valuable. If the girls can get Podrick to come back more and more, perhaps in between wine and pillow talk, they can get useful information for Littlefinger. Even innocuous details such as Tyrion’s mood or when he calls it a day as he begins analyzing the ledgers would be useful information. 

Tyrion on the other hand is ready to believe the girls were genuinely overwhelmed by Podrick’s prowess almost instantly. He claims that because they didn’t take HIS gold they didn’t get paid at all. He’s overlooking that Littlefinger can pay his girls himself out of his own pocket in gold, favors, or advancement in his organization. It’s like if you get a dinner on the house at a restaurant. The staff working on your meal are still getting paid just by the owner instead of by you. Same concept here that Tyrion doesn’t even consider.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, Tyrion is horribly biased in this exchange because he deeply wants to believe that prostitutes aren’t motivated only by money. His first relationship with Tysha (which tragically is revealed as genuine) was one where Tyrion believed she loved him and he was told she was only a prostitute hired by Jaime. And also with Shae there is that same tension as Tyrion struggles with how much Shae actually cares for him. The things he is saying about Podrick’s encounter are the things Tyrion tells himself constantly when he doubts Shae. Bronn, bereft of that internal conflict, sees the easy truth immediately that Podrick is being set up somehow.

&amp;nbsp;

Tyrion also dismisses that the prostitutes were faking because Podrick claims he didn’t say anything about his life or Tyrion. He shows this as evidence that they weren’t interested in anything Podrick knows. However, there is an easy long game in Podrick believe he is amazing at sex and then, more importantly, spreading that rumor around. In the next episode Kissed by Fire Ros and Varys meet and Ros tells the Spider about Tyrion and Podrick. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVDsWL7gahs

&amp;nbsp;

The story being told is that Podrick is extraordinary yet not in any specific way. Ros even notes how odd it is that the normally descriptive girls have no details. Later we see the rumors about Pod spreading. 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1xXdjMk8fU

&amp;nbsp;

Random women are giggling appreciatively at  Podrick as he runs by, when before he was invisible and looked down on. The long game here is less obvious, however it is planting the idea in Podrick’s mind that now strangers are rightly interested in him sexually. He previously would be suspicious of advances given his low social standing and average looks, and is also suspicious of Littlefinger’s girls. Now that he knows he has a reputation, the interest seems justified. What Littlefinger could now do is send one of his employees in disguise as a chance encounter and have Pod believe they are genuinely interested in him. That sounds convoluted though right? Not when you consider Littlefinger does this exact thing to Loras Tyrell with Olyvar.

&amp;nbsp;

Littlefinger sends his male prostitute Olyvar to pose as a squire for Loras Tyrell and seduces the Knight of Flowers. From then on, Littlefinger has a constant source of information inside the Tyrells that he exploits. Olyvar even becomes privy to conversations between Loras and Margaery. Part of the reason this works is that Loras believes it is reasonable that Olyvar would be attracted to him, so he does not question the chance encounter and then becomes taken in by Olyvar’s act. With Podrick’s sexual prowess buoying his self image, he too may be caught in a similar web.

&amp;nbsp;

Why this plan doesn’t work on Podrick is revealed in season 4. Podrick has been burying his nose in books instead which he shows off by naming the banners of the Dornish houses as they arrive for Joffrey’s wedding. Tyrion is one the few lords that encourages their squires to learn and actively teaches the boy. Pod’s work ethic and duties as a squire has rendered him unavailable for a continuation of the honey pot strategy. In the end it was a gamble from Littlefinger that failed, but not a high cost. Tyrion never realized what was happening and all it cost Littlefinger was a small pouch of gold. 

&amp;nbsp;

It’s clever writing and planning by the show writers that despite Tyrion’s self-professed prowess at playing the Game of Thrones, he has a very large blindspot that can be exploited. There are games being played even above Tyrion’s head and he’s nowhere near in control as he thinks. Also the callback from Loras and Olyvar allows the viewer to go back and see this scene, which was played for comedic effect, and re-evaluate what is happening under Tyrion’s nose. Tyrion is in far more danger and scrutiny from Littlefinger than he ever realized. And that the hole in his heart left by Tysha is where Tyrion is the most vulnerable. 

&amp;nbsp;

And that is the mystery of what Podrick did in that brothel: nothing special. Just another pawn being moved around the board by the real players in King’s Landing. 

###TL:DR Littlefinger tried to honey pot Podrick to gain an unwitting spy on Tyrion who recently took over as Master of Coin

"[SPOILERS] Where did the Others, including the Night's Queen, come from?","Let me start off by saying that this will be a big bold range of theories. I am not necessarily going to cling to any 1 specific theory, but rather introduce a few ideas that are good strong possibilities. These ideas represent the possible filling in of Key information that we have not been told by GRRM as of yet. Also a lot of these ideas are borrowed and tweaked from other analysts.

The others in the novels remain 1 of the biggest mysteries in the series, if not the most important mystery of all. They are at the head of the story in a sense that they are the primary antagonists or threat to our favorite characters. They represent the biggest conflict of our tale: the clashing of Ice with Fire. They give the story a sense of impending doom and urgency, and yet we don’t know why exactly, or even how to stop them. This definitely keeps us on the edge of our seat. GRRM rarely writes about them, but gives us several clues about their nature and behavior from other sources and characters, such as Melisandre, but also a lot of their symbolism and mythology can be learned from the Kingsguard, not just that they are in a sense, soldiers, they work as a group, they have leadership, but also they have an aura about them, one that demands respect.

Their origin is a very important part of understanding who they are and what they want. We have been denied an actual origin story thus far but, GRRM has given us some bread crumbs that lead us in a general direction of thought. The story of the Night’s King and his corpse like bride, is probably the most obvious reference to the origin of the others except…the timing is all wrong. They Night’s King was said to have been the 13th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch meaning that the NW, the Long Night and thus the Others had to of pre-existed. Now that could mean that the timeline we were given was purposefully incorrect, but then why would the author even bother? What is the point of giving us just that singe piece of character defining info if it is incorrect? Certainly if GRRM wanted to give us incorrect info he would hide it in several other facts, but yet this is really the only piece of info we have to figure out who the Night’s King was. Assuming that info must be correct, then what is the purpose of the NK story if not to tell us the origin of the others? What I suggest is that, the mating of the NK and his corpse like bride was the 1st time that a human and other produced a child together. Thus created the first group of “White Walkers” aka Hybrids, half breeds, mergers of the human genome with that of the others.

In that respect White Walkers are more human like than the Others, and would have some remaining link to humanity in them. Therefore they might even sympathize with humans and have some measure of understanding. Where as the Others were the original ice beings, and were seemingly all but destroyed during the 1st long night save for maybe a few including the Corpse like queen that either hypnotized or fell in love with the Night’s King.

So that explains White Walkers but what about their ancestors the original Others, where did they come from if not born on Westeros? To answer that we need to look to the TV show which tells us of a different but perhaps similar origin: The WWs are a result of Dragonglass; those magical chunks of frozen fire. Now granted, in the TV show Dragonglass is mined from caves but the show tends to simplify and downplay the heavy fiction, fantasy elements of the novels, in favor of more realistic and practical choices. In the book, Maester Luwin says that Dragonglass came from the fires below the world, but Maesters are notorious for telling lies about all things magical. What I suggest is that Dragonglass is Not a naturally occurring element of their planet. Now considering its name we could guess that maybe its origins are the same as dragons in that it came from volcanoes? However, there is a rather peculiar back-story from Qarth about how the “moon” got too close to the sun and shattered spilling out multitudes of “dragons”. Now you could just chalk this up to the characters being ignorant and superstitious or you could see it as a clue that something dragon like did come from the sky. Dragonglass is often shown to be spear headed or pointy in nature; well wouldn’t that make sense if it had been splintered off like a shard of glass shooting through outer space? GRRM provides us with other clues that reference the sun and moon story such as the name of the seat and the sigil of house Martell which portrays a spear of the sun. This idea of the sun having a spear or using a spear could easily provide the evidence of how flame destroyed a moon and the pieces rained down like dragons with flaming tails. In the Martel sigil the sun figure is red, but could it possibly be referring to a red star instead? A big red burning star that when shattered would look like it was bleeding? Bleeding giant pieces of flaming red rock / stone? Flaming red pointy stone that looks like dragons, yet when lands, cools off it turns black. What else do we know that looks red when hot and black when not? Perhaps when a blacksmith makes a sword, such as widow’s wail, or when a Targaryen changes his banners, a Blackfyre? Or shadow fire? Could this all be a metaphor for the sun’s effect on a moon/planet that when in the glow of the hot sun appears red, but when in the shadow turns black as night and cold as winter? Or could there be two moons, 1 red and 1 black; the red responsible for all fire magic of the series and the black responsible for the Others and wights.

Indeed, it’s all about the sun’s influence and favor. Dragonglass is the sun’s own fire (seed) shot through the moon’s core (heart) and the result is a multitude of fire trapped inside frozen moon fragments.

Now that we have established that Dragonglass, or even the alternate black greasy / oily stone that was first mentioned in a clash of kings chapter 26, could have other worldly origins, it is not hard to see the similarities between these stones and the Others. The Blackstone described in the aforementioned chapter is exactly the same description of the stone that the Bloodstone emperor worshipped and formed a religion around; a religion aptly named the church of starry wisdom. Now this blackstone is different from Dragonglass yet it must possess some type of magical if not hypnotic properties if it could influence people to worship it. Scholars even claim that the worship of this stone caused the emperor to kill his sister and thus caused the long night. This also explains how the WWs have the ability to raise the dead, as the Emperor was known to practice Necromancy and other dark arts. Could this stone have come from a cold moon/ planet? By worshiping this stone and practicing dark arts, could he have performed a ritual that caused a solar eclipse or possibly even a meteor shower? Or to take it 1 step further, an invitation for an other-worldly race to descend to his planet?

Or could it be possible that such beings crash landed on Westeros, and the impact of their landing along with other giant chunks of their home world, caused so much debris and dust to fill up the sky and block out the sun for an extended period of time? With that notion it seems that what we have been lead to believe was a medieval fantasy story was really just a clever disguise for a sci- fi thriller. This is after all a GRRM story and what would that be without some type of alien invasion or deviant sub species?",gameofthrones,True,1522765812,2018-04-03

"Would you rather get The Winds of Winter but never see a Dream of Spring, or have GRRM say that the series will never be finished and that we'll not see another book?",,gameofthrones,True,1522778260,2018-04-03
"[SPOILERS]You have to choose: We will get The Winds of Winter, but for sure never see A Dream of Spring - or GRRM comes out now and says for certain that we'll never see either book. Which do you pick and why?","This is something that I give a lot of thought to, and there are big pros and cons to both sides. Before making your choice, I want to provide more detail to both of these options: 

Option 1: We will get The Winds of Winter, but we'll never see A Dream of Spring. In this scenario, we're going to say that GRRM will release Winds within the next year or two (maybe after Season 8 finishes airing?). He'll continue to work on Dream, but he'll either die or become too physically incapable of finishing the series, so we will never get the conclusion to the books. The biggest pro here is obvious - getting more story. GRRM has said a few times that we'll get more details about The Others in Winds, so even though we wouldn't see the end of the series from George, we would still get more of his vision and it would be easier to theorize where he wanted the end to go if we had an entirely new book. The biggest con is also obvious - we would get that close to the end, but we wouldn't see it. We'll still get the ending of the series through the TV show, but it's obviously going to be a simplified version of what is coming in the books, so it would be awful to get that close to George's ending only to not get it. 

Option 2: GRRM actually admits that the series will never be finished, and we never get another book. In this scenario, he might not be finishing for a number of reasons (He just doesn't want to, he can't figure out how to end it, etc) but the biggest thing here is that GRRM actually tells us that he won't finish, so we don't have to keep waiting and wondering. So the major pro here is that we get some sort of closure - even though we don't get the end of the series, we get GRRM actually admitting that he can't/won't finish the series and we can finally just let it go. But the major con is also there - we won't ever see the last two books. All of this time invested into the book series, and we just won't ever see the end.

Neither situation is ideal, but if you had to pick one, which one would you choose? ",gameofthrones,True,1522778376,2018-04-03

Considering that the ending has been described by GRRM as ""bittersweet"", would it be far-fetched to consider that the ending would result in the deaths of Daenerys and potentially Jon too, meaning Gendry taking the throne, as a legitimised Baratheon. 

In making Gendry the ""winner"" of this bittersweet ending, it would be paying respect to the lore of the show (it isn't exactly a random, out of the blue or unbelievable ending), as well as sticking to GRRM's subversion of peoples expectations.

[SPOILERS] trying to understand the family trees and who should have the throne. Spoilers season 7,"So many questions...

In an early season Ned told Jon Snow that when he returned he would tell him about his mother. Okay, so now we know that Ned knew who Jon Snows real mother was. We also know that he knew Jon Snows real name was Aegon Targaryen. I don't remember if he knew about the secret wedding between Rhaegar and Lyanna - but, if he did that means he knew that Jon was the rightful heir to the throne and yet he let Robert Baratheon take the throne and let Jon go to the wall where he would have to swear off ever holding a throne. Did Ned know this? or did he not know about the wedding and think Jon was still a bastard anyway.

The throne loophole. So, apparently since Jon has died he is released from his oath to guard the wall. Since it was a ""rest of my life / till I die"" type pledge and well... he died. So, he has left the wall and been proclaimed King of the North. Interesting that the people in the north were okay with him breaking his vows since most of them do not know that he has died. Also, if he did try and take the iron throne would there be someone trying to say ""he can't do that because he swore his life to guard the wall..."" at which time he would either have to step down OR he would have to admit he died (which he seems to guard for fear people would see him as crazy).

Someone mentioned that since Jon is a Targaryen he would likely be able to ride dragons and walk through fire. However, when Daenerys brother Viserys was killed by the molten gold Daenerys said ""he must not have dragon blood in him"" or something like that - which implied that maybe he was not truly in her bloodline. I don't see how Viserys could die from fire and people would think Jon would not.

disclaimer: yes, I know it is a fantasy movie and if you are willing to accept the dead walking and dragons flying you should probably accept the bloodline questions as insignificant... just curious as I wait for Season 8.

**Littlefinger, the Death Cheater**
-

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdLletjWIew&amp;index=1&amp;list=LLLvVbybZLTTxqmNjm-KZh7g : credit to Neo’s channel for perfectly explaining how Baelish made us all believe he was miserably defeated in s07e07. 
When in reality, he let the faceless woman to whom he gave an iron coin (s07e05) die in his place while wearing a mask of his face (as it is possible to wear the face of a living person without having necessarily skinned him:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljFljgf2USk&amp;t=126s ). 
____
Littlefinger is the song of Ice &amp; Fire: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dz80BjU0wE&amp;t=292s (4:52 - 5:26) &amp; 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dz80BjU0wE&amp;t=942s (15:42 - 15:50). 

He has been involved in every major event in the last 30 years of GoT history: Robert Rebellion (he spread the rumor that Lyanna was abducted and raped roughly 1 year after being defeated by Brandon Stark), Starks and Lannisters, Joeffrey's poisoning, etc., etc.
___
For all the bad writing D&amp;D are capable of, they still take their lead from Martin when it comes to the ending of major plotlines. And even they are not stupid enough to have given us 5 out of 7 episodes in season 7 where every single character/peasant and their mother were yelling at Littlefinger that they had 0 trust in him and wanted him dead.   
___
Look at the interview Aidan Gillen gave to the LA Times: *""I don’t think Baelish does crocodile tears. I don’t think Baelish likes to shed tears, certainly not in front of people. If we saw some emotion, I don’t really think it was sentimental. I think it was involuntary: Your time is up.""* http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-game-of-thrones-littlefinger-petyr-baelish-20170828-htmlstory.html
___
And what do we see in episode 7? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=2704s  (45:04 – 49:42)
The exact things Peter would never do: running around, begging for mercy and for his life while shedding tears large enough to make your baby jealous. 
___
Now compare that performance to other instances where Baelish has been physically in danger or on the verge of death:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SczY9E4UbBM&amp;t=385s (6:25 - 6:48)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dz80BjU0wE&amp;t=344s (5:44 - 6:40)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvPAbanXEaE&amp;t=720s (12:00 - 12:24)

Every single time, calculate and impeccable control. As you would expect from a man that has been plotting for 30 years straight without a rest. Such a man will not be taken by surprise when the end comes. But a faceless man playing the last moments of this man would think he would be...
___
Aidan Gillen: *""I think over-discussing things, particularly in a show that’s as over-discussed as “Game of Thrones” is diminishing. My job, as this character, will probably go on for a while avoiding questions like that. It’s a good one to ask, but Littlefinger will take secrets to his grave and so will I.""*  
Who says that?? What kind of answer is that? What secrets could you possibly be taking to your grave Gillen if this was the last we were ever going to hear from Littlefinger? It’s just an acting gig, not a sect! Unless…

**The Fate of Arya Stark**
-

One of the dumbest and most uncharacteristic plotlines of season 7 was Littlefinger trying to exploit the tension between the Stark girls in the hope of turning Sansa against Arya from episode 5 to 7. 
___
Look how unusual and unfamiliar Aidan Gillen acting is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=2145s (35:45 – 37:40) &amp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=2462s (41:02 – 43:28)
Baelish’s train of thoughts is less cunning and his attempts at manipulating Sansa blunt and straightforward, almost as if he was on autopilot, almost as if he was another person…
___
Now, why would Baelish ever want Arya dead? Because he was afraid of her skills as an assassin or afraid of the possibility she might kill him in the future? 
___
Getting rid of Arya would not amount to anything for Peter as Bran and his knowledge are still around. Even Sansa would end up figuring things out at some point. Baelish is not Joffrey. He’s not the type of person to plot the execution of people that dislike him or have the physical aptitude to eventually kill him; otherwise, he’d be plotting the execution of 95% of the people he has ever encountered. This doesn’t add up because the answer is he doesn’t.
___
Littlefinger doesn’t care about the fate of Arya Stark but the Faceless Men do. By this time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=1760s (29:20), the mastermind had already fled and been replaced by his faceless man body double who started pushing forward her own clumsy scheming agenda.
___
And so, the dumb plotline turns into a very cohesive one.
___
Arya was allowed to leave the cult of the faceless men after the debt of life she owed to the many faced god was paid with the death of the waif instead of Lady Crane’s.
But after her departure, she went straight back to her obsessive list of names and went on to eradicate all the Freys using the faces of a servant and of Walder Frey.
___
By doing so, a girl stole from the many faced god. These men’s lives weren’t hers to take, at least not by abusing the magic of the faceless men. And we know what of a bunch of extreme fanatics the faceless men are: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljFljgf2USk&amp;t=38s (00:38 – 1:10) &amp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljFljgf2USk&amp;t=95s (1:35 – 2:10)  *“Now a debt is owed and only death can pay for life”*, Arya Stark’s death.
___
As Jaqen H'ghar said: *“The faces are for no one, you are still someone. And to someone, the faces are as good as poison”*. In this case, the faceless men are the poison that has come as far as Winterfell to take her life in exchange for those she stole from the many faced god.

___
Being present at the execution of her father and at the murder of her mother and brother at such a young age (red wedding) has traumatized her. Her pursuit of bringing death to the people she hated has consumed her. And her time with the faceless men as altered her mental even more (their training consists mostly on a self-inflicted brainwashing and feelings’ stripping). But in exchange, she gained a lot of strength.
___
This strength has made her become overly confident. It’s almost as if she now believes the power she has obtained allows her to get away with doing anything or assassinating anyone without any repercussions:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=1331s  (22:11 – 25:00 &amp;) Look at the constant smug on her face.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=1610s (26:50 – 27:12)
___
Obviously, the plot to trick Sansa into getting rid of Arya failed when the faceless women playing Littlefinger died at the hands of Arya by the end of season 7. But there are more faceless men to come and contrary to the time when the waif attacked, this time, Arya’s guard is down.

Cue the young actress around Arya's age they cast in November to play in a Dave Nutter episode (most likely 1 or 2), which will be a faceless woman sent to kill Arya: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwF5J3moJ0A&amp;t=77s (1:17 - 1:52).
___
There will be consequences to Arya turning into a killer. And the Faceless Men are a relentless and skilled bunch. With her death, the Valeryan steel dagger will be picked up by Jon as something to remember Arya's spirit by.

**A Fight between Good vs. Evil?**
-

What have D&amp;D been trying to convince us of for the past 2 seasons? That in the end, this show is about the fight between a gathering of good guys (Jon Snow/Daenerys &amp; Co., aka Strong/Just/Good looking/Anything else cool you can think of) and the big villain (Night King and White Walkers, ugly and so bluntly evil that they can’t even talk, forged with one sole purpose by the children of the forest: to end life).
___
Most people think this is the direction the show has taken and have been disappointed or unimpressed by this development. This means the show runners have done a fantastic job at adapting the novel series as almost nobody is doubting the path it is taking.
___
But if you think this story leads up to someone defeating the Night King and the Wights, you haven’t been paying attention…
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIva5LzhPFE&amp;t=1616s (26:56 – 27:19);
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIva5LzhPFE&amp;t=1953s (32:33 – 32:40) *“If everybody thinks your character is a hero or if everybody thinks your character is a villain, then you are writing cardboards.”*
___
And let's be real, at this point, everybody thinks the Night King is the braindead (literally) villain and Jon &amp; Co. are the ultimate gathering of the good guys. So are D&amp;D writing cardboards to end the story? Of course not! GRR Martin would never have let that happen.
___
What is the most important message George will want to get across the entirety of this series?
___
To understand that, you need to look at the event that has most shaped GRRM as a young adult: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIva5LzhPFE&amp;t=374s (6:14 – 8:30)  *“Before researching the Vietnam War, I just thought that we were in another war and we were helping poor people defend themselves against evil communist aggression. And then I actually researched the war, […] suddenly, it did not look at all so clear cut to me.”* 
___
George has been repeatedly illustrating this idea at every chance he gets in the series: very few confrontations between people are as black and white as we would like to believe. Both parties are always motivated by strong convictions (whether it’d be reasoning/law/ideal/faith/love/honor or survival). Once these convictions are strong enough, they act as a veil that allows one to justify any action (even it being taking the life of another person in the name of such a cause). But if you take time to understand both parties’ motivations from their perspective; oftentimes, it becomes very difficult to point out the good guy from the bad guy (in real history as well).  
___
It’s a point of view that is easy to grasp when you look at fights such as the battle of the Wall between the Men of the Watch and Mance Rayder wildling army. Our heroes, Jon, Sam &amp; Co. need to protect Westeros and their lands from Northern invaders while the ever likable and charismatic Mance needs to fight the Night’s watch in order to go south or all wildlings will die by the hands of the Whitewalkers. Hard to root for any specific side in a battle between these too, isn’t it?
___
But what happens when the 2 parties are: 1) the army of the dead (Night King &amp; the Whitewalkers) and 2) the alliance of the living (Jon Snow &amp; Co.)? Surely, against this kind of pure evil, such thinking cannot be applied, right?

**The White Walkers: An unheard voice**
-

You’ve been told by the children of the forest, ancient tales and various manuscripts that the White Walkers are a weapon of mass destruction and are here to kill all of the living and you have seen with your own eyes the mass murder they afflicted upon the wildlings at Hardhome. But has anyone in Westeros taken the time to thoroughly  think through how they operate and clarify what their goal is?
___
Is the Night King’s goal really to wipe out all form of life in the world? Does he have any conscience at all?
___
We need to look at what we have seen so far from the White walkers to try to answer this question:
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=845s (14:05 – 15:00)  A White Walker looks into the unharmful and fearful eyes of Sam and does to not kill him but rather keeps on marching south. 
This shows that there is some degree of free will in the Whitewalkers (or in the Night King, since he is most likely controlling them) or at least, that they can refrain from killing anyone alive (probably as long as they do not express any harmful intention towards them).
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=1028s (17:08 – 17:40) Wights however, attack anyone without hesitation. These are mere tools, animated and controlled by the power of the White Walkers and solely programmed to attack on sight. Wights have no conscience. 
___
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=1645s (27:35 – 28:52) Further proof that White Walkers are capable of not killing every human life they see: e.g. Crestor and the babies that the Night King intends to turn into White Walkers.
___
So these scenes let us know that: 1) White Walkers are capable of sparing human life, 2) their sole purpose is not to kill any living form on sight and 3) they are marching towards a goal, something or someone that is south of the Wall.
___
Then around s06e05, the White Walkers are gathered as they intend to march South. But once the Night King sees Bran looking at them, he marks him and all the Whites go back North to kill this kid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do2M5V3mlak&amp;t=687s (11:27 – 12:17). 
___
Now, why would killing Bran be so important to the Night King that he’d specifically mark him and turn around his entire army for just one man’s life? Is it because he sees the strong potential in Bran and needs to get rid of him before his powers grow too much? The answer is no.
___

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UsSH1E01LM (3:55 – 5:37) Benjen Stark *“The children found me. They stopped the walkers’ magic from taking hold the same way they made the walkers in the first place”*  
___
Through Benjen, we learn that it is possible for a host in which the children of the forest have plunged dragon glass to still have most of his conscience. So when that dragon glass is plunged into a host, the children can control how much of his former self and his awareness they choose to leave in that body. In the case of the Night King, being in the middle of a violent war, the children tuned the awareness down to a minimum to make him as much of an inhuman killing machine as they could. However, what they didn’t account for, was for Bran’s spirit to be in that body at that time, high jacking the process and resulting in a failure to turn this body into a simple weapon…
___
What if a shred of his former human conscience remained in the Night King?  What if the strongest will of the former owner of the body remained in this killing machine? Being at war with the Children, the man strongest will would have been to kill the Children of the forest. Hence the Night King turning against its creators.
But in the Night King’s body is trapped another spirit, Bran’s spirit. And what is Bran single everlasting conviction: to protect life. Once the Children of the forest started going extinct (against a combination of White Walkers, the Andals &amp; the Night King), only Bran’s will remained in that body.
___
And what could the remaining pieces of Bran’ spirit do with a body that can only do one thing, killing? How do you protect life when you know the only thing you can do is bring death and when you know that no one has the power to stop you from inflicting it?
___
The answer is by killing. Killing and destroying is the only tool and form of free will at the disposal of the Night King in his current state of existence.
___
Destroying the source of magic that keeps him bound to the curse: the main Heart tree at the Isles of Faces that is at the center of all Weirwood trees in Westeros (similar to this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do2M5V3mlak&amp;t=473s  ""7:53 – 7:55"") and killing himself by killing Bran.
___
This is why the army of the dead completely turns around and goes back North when the Night King marks Bran. Because killing Bran is the priority. This is why the White Walkers have been specifically trying to march south past the Wall and this is why they had been trying to communicate their intentions to whoever could see by forming symbols on the ground using the only pen they could, dead bodies:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=153s (2:33 – 3:05) A 2D drawing of the weirwood Heart tree at the Isle of faces (as well as a Whight can draw with dead body parts); the circle represents the isle and the line in the middle is the Heart tree (the part of the line going above the circle designates the trunk above the surface and the part of the line under the circle is the root of the weirwood tree).

You can see it even more clearly here under the drawings of the 3 men: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=199&amp;v=LJnMJc6Xgs0&amp;t=182s (3:02);

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaXbz6YZt9U&amp;t=1128s (18:48 – 19:15) Whirlwind paintings referring to the Heart tree in the Isle of Faces.
___
Had they known, all Westerosi people had to do was let the Night King and the White Walkers pass through. 
___
As a result, who would be the villain in this scenario? Is it the Night King and the Whitewalkers that killed tens of thousands so they could stop themselves from endlessly killing life? Or is it Jon/Bran &amp; Co. that sent tens of thousands to their death instead of stepping aside like Sam did in his first encounter with a White Walker?
___
One thing is for certain, knowledge would have been their true savior. Even with the most unlikely kind of people or thing, there may be common ground. In this case, both the Night King &amp; Jon Snow were fighting for the same cause without realizing it: to protect the living. *Make sure to think things through before you act.*
___
In the end, knowledge is power. 
*(does this remind you of anyone?)*

**Why does the Night King need newborn babies to turn into White Walkers?**
-

The Night King is the same man we saw in the origin story with the addition of Bran spirit being trapped inside of him, turned by the Children of the forest into a killing machine. The only semblance of free will he has in this state of existence is: 1) killing humans and animals 2) expanding his army of the dead and 3) to be fair, probably also being able to move in whichever direction he chooses and some other small things like drawing with dead bodies to a certain extent, etc.
___
To expand his army, this Night King chooses newborn babies.
___
Now why would the Night King specifically need to use babies to create walkers? I would assume turning babies into Whitewalkers means he has to wait at least 15-20 years before he can realistically cash back on an adult Whitewalker? Why not simply use any strong adult warrior captured among the wildling ranks? 
___
The answer is because a new born baby does not have time to form any strong conviction or thought. Which means when the Night King turns the baby into a Whitewalker, he will transform into his complete puppet without any chance of it having any shred of strong conviction/motivation. Because a newborn baby never had time to experience much thought. Bran, aka the Night King, needs his Whitewalkers to be completely obedient to his will, contrary to what happened when the Children of the forest created him. So that there is no chance of the Night King ever turning a psychotic human adult filled with hatred for other human beings into a Whitewalker that could disobey his will and attack humans that would not present a threat.

**The Lion vs The Kraken &amp; The Dragon**
-
In season 8, we will be introduced to the Golden Company, which Euron is bringing to King's Landing to support the Lannisters. By this time, Euron has proven himself a ""faithful"" servant to the Iron Crown.
___
While he is traveling, Cersei has a miscarriage and loses her unborn child. Like the Valonqar prophecy stated, she will drown in her tears. Having lost every person she has ever cared for, Cersei agrees to proceed with marrying Euron (which is also a little brother). And to pay homage to the Iron Born custom, she agrees to be reborn by ""drowning"" in the ocean.
___
In the meantime, Theon plots the rescue of Yara and fails miserably, resulting in both of their deaths. After this regrettable event, Euron is crowned King and marries Cersei. 
___
Now remember what Euron's sigil is? It's a silver Kraken above a glaring red eye. The red eye symbolizes Bloodraven, aka Three Eyed Raven (=TER), aka Brynden Rivers, aka the most dedicated defender of the Targaryen reign ever. The TER had helped Euron awaken his powers and had taught him how to use them in exchange for helping Daenerys reclaim the Iron Throne. Bloodraven made Euron believe he intended on having him sit on the Iron Throne by Dany's side. But what he had always planned was to crown Jon king with Dany by his side.
___
So on their wedding night, Euron distracts the Mountain. While in bed with Cersei, he tries to murder her. With Cersei's death, Euron would have become the ruler of the 7 Kingdoms. Then, he would have convinced Dany to marry him instead of fighting (which he could have done thanks to the big Dragon controlling horn he had acquired if she had not fallen in love with Snow).
___
It was the perfect scenario for the TER. Except Euron had been fooling Brynden Rivers all along. He had never intended on sitting Daenerys on the Iron Throne. Euron is "" the storm - the first storm, and the last"". *(more on that in part 2)*
___
A dashing young man covered in Black &amp; Red saves the Queen and executes the Greyjoy, putting an end to whichever scheme Euron had been building up to. This soldier from the Golden Company is Aegon Targaryen (Elia Martell &amp; Rhaegar Targaryen's first born son, that Varys had smuggled from death and raised among Blackfyres). With their leader's death, the Iron Born's fleet dismantles and scatters throughout the sea.
___
*P.S. Aegon Targaryen being Elia's son that had been miraculously saved by Varys from the hands of the Mountain is a show related idea. In the books however, Aegon Targaryen is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen &amp; Lyanna Stark. And Jon Snow is really the King in the North, the rightful heir to Winterfell, the Sword of the Morning, the wielder of the true Lightbringer, Dawn, and the first son of Ned Stark &amp; Ashara Dayne. While Mance Rayder is really Arthur Dayne, Jon's uncle working as hard as he can to make Jon look like he has plot armor North of the Wall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ti6z8KL44g&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLQrZpjVj947iED_JCrqwGFW1VkchOnl1f.* 

*Merging these two characters into Jon Snow was a poor choice from D&amp;D. It created a ton of plotholes and forced us into another incestuous relationship between Jon &amp; Dany that should never have happened, had Jon been the result of Ned's first marriage with Ashara.*
___
Varys's real intentions were never to get rid of the Targaryens and have Blackfyres sit on the Iron Throne like his ancestors wanted. Nor was it to devote himself to the well-being of the small people like he had claimed so often. Varys had seen what internal conflict had done to their family and was sick of it. This is why he had worked his entire life to bring together the whole Targaryen family (Blackfyres + Targaryens). His raising Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia + Rhaegar/ rightful heir) among Blackfyres, was the perfect opportunity for Varys to forge a good King for the Iron Throne. A man with a strong name, raised with knowledge and empathy, that would one day close the rift once formed between Blackfyres and Targaryens. Aegon/""Young Griff"" could have healed the realm back to its former glory and to its former peace. Like it had once been before the civil rebellions.

*Ironically, Bloodraven/Brynden Rivers, stuck in his old ways and convinced that Balckfyres could never be trusted, had been fighting Varys as the Three Eyed Raven all along, since the day he ordered Varys's genitals burnt. In the end, Bloodraven had wasted most of his energy fighting the one man that was putting his soul out to help this family stopping from killing each other. Once again, knowledge would have been power.*
___
___
Back in the North, Tyrion reunites with Jaime and is desperate to understand how Cersei managed to outmaneuver him. To prove his good faith, Jaime lets Daenerys know the spy master, Varys, had betrayed them and was the one leaking battle plans to Cersei &amp; Euron in season 7. You didn't think Jaime, Euron or Cersei would outmaneuver Tyrion without some serious insider help, didn't you? In this case, Tyrion misplaced trust in Varys was the reason for his failure.
___
Faithful to her word, Daenerys burns Varys alive after he gets exposed. But Varys's lifetime sacrifice had not been in vein, as his protege, Aegon Targaryen, was as close as any Blackfyre had ever been to the Iron Throne.
___
Varys had to leak Tyrion's plans to Cersei for Dany's overwhelming army to be reduced to a more manageable size in case she were to become a threat to Aegon (for whom the Golden Company fights). At first, Varys still supported Dany as she was the perfect person to weaken the stability and strength of the Crown at the time. And he was hoping to have her marry Aegon and see them both reign from the Iron Throne. But when Dany fell in love with Jon Snow, Varys's plans at any marital alliance fell into pieces and the only way Aegon would rule would have to be by fully supporting Cersei &amp; defeating Daenerys's army (aka the Foreign Invader). Then getting rid of Cersei (aka the Mad Queen), thus presenting Aegon Targaryen as the savior of the realm and the rightful ruler of the 7 Kingdoms.

**Azor Ahai**
-

One of the most debated subjects in GoT is the person that will turn out to be Azor Ahai. Is it Jon? Is it Danny? Is it Euron? Is it GRRM? Who is it?
___
Azor Ahai is the man that has the smartest and most magnetizing dialogues in the entire series, the man that has been singing the song of Ice &amp; Fire for 30 years: Peter *Littlefinger* Baelish himself.
___
But it just isn't as literal as you would think: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNPCGcfcBbA&amp;t=396s , GRRM: *""The prophecies must be taken with a grain of salt. I am amused to see fans argue over the true identity of a character that is a legend, when you have to know how to read between the lines and distinguish the facts from the speculation.""*
___
Littlefinger will be the savior of King's Landing. But not the savior from the army of the dead. He is no fool to ever get into stabbing range of the Night King. Given how much power the Night King has, given how little Peter knows about him (would stabbing the Night King with the Valyrian steel dagger even kill him? we don't even know for sure and so does Littlefinger) and given that Baelish knows he is not a warrior, it would be very uncharacteristic of him to be anywhere near the Night King any time soon. He is a betting man indeed, but not one to act without knowledge. And there are very few things he could possibly know regarding the Night King.
___
But do you know who can certainly be killed by a weapon? Daenerys Targaryen. 
___
___
___
**The fate of Daenerys Targaryen**
-

Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons *(I am running out of breath here)*, has a good heart and has suffered and overcome an heroic and extreme journey.  But she has also repeatedly demonstrated that she was a terrible politician and has had tendencies to resort to extremism when she felt cornered. It doesn't help that she has weapons of mass destruction at her side (dragons), making her every will almost unstoppable. 
___
Daenerys is a bad ruler: she burnt most of the things she encountered south of the narrow sea and left Meereen in complete chaos to be ruled by Daario Naharis, a mercenary who never expressed any interest in politics. And after one final round of burning stuff around in Meeren, she left (thank god for D&amp;D not keeping us to date with Meeren, cause by now, it must have become a tragic mess). The only decent political choices she ever made happened the few times she managed to listen to the advice of Jorah or Tyrion.
___
Back in Westeros, she wanted to quickly get rid of Cersei by burning King's Landing down (just a little bit). But as long as she was certain to win, she showed patience and listened to her wiser advisers. However, the second things turned sour and Tyrion got outmaneuvered by Jaime and Euron, she went back to her extremist thinking and was ready to burn it all in King's Landing. The only reason this did not happen and she moved on to burning part of the Lannister army and their food provisions instead was because she listened to the irresistible charisma of Jon Snow. He, who is becoming, by the end of season 7, the most important man to her eyes.
___
___
___
**Jon Snow, The Chosen One**
-
Now, if we know one thing about Jon Snow, it is that this man has the strongest urge of all to get himself killed (that honorable Stark blood running through his veins). Back at the wall, he went solo onto a suicide mission to negotiate a truce with Mance. The only reason he survived was because he got lucky that Stannis arrived in time. He brought the Wildlings south of the wall against everyone's will and he died for it. As soon as he was brought back to life, he went on another suicide battle against the Boltons where he was gravely outnumbered. Miraculously surviving long enough for the Knights of the Vale to save him. Then, he went on the craziest mission of all to bring back a Whight. And that would somehow convince Cersei to join their cause? He should have died for it (god bless plot armor). Jon Snow seems to be the most obvious depiction of the little hero who goes up against 20 villains and who in the end, ends up being fine no matter the odds, again and again, and again. But this is not the message GRRM wants to convey through this character and there have been enough of these stories already. The mastermind is baiting us once more.
___
In season 8, Daenerys's armies and the North will unite at Winterfell to fight the dead. The Night King's army cannot pass through the walls of Winterfell as the same magic that once formed the wall had been put into the Stark's ancestral home. However, Vyserion's blue fire manages to pierce through its magic and allows the dead to hit Winterfell. At great cost, the living will manage to get rid of Viserion. And the heroics of Jon &amp; co will allow men to succeed in stabbing the Night King with Valyrian steel (hence the Dagger Jon had inherited from Arya). The Night King's body will burst into pieces. But the army of the dead is still standing... The body of the Night King slowly reforms itself out of dust and his piercing blue eyes reappear. Neither Valyrian steel nor fire seem to stop him.
___
Seing their plan had failed and the army of the dead was progressively growing while men were being butchered, Jon orders a retreat. Half of the army flees by horse or through the secret tunnels of Winterfell while Jon &amp; a few others fly away on Dragons.
___
Dany &amp; Jon regroup at Dragonstone, where Dany is soon expecting a baby. The side of the living is running out of options. That is when a red Priestess appears through the dark night. Despite Jon's warning, Melisandre has returned to guide the living.
___
Melisandre explains why the Night King could not be defeated: the army of the dead, hence the Night King, can only be eradicated by one man, Azor Ahai (aka Jon Snow). However, even Azor Ahai can not vanquish the dead on his own. He needs to sacrifice his one true love (Daenerys Targaryen) in order to reforge a sacred weapon, Lightbringer. Only then would he be able to defeat the Night King. 
___
Being men of their words, Jon &amp; Davos have Melisandre executed for her past crimes. Melisandre had accepted her fate and knew she would die for it. And die she does. But she had finally completed the mission the Lord had been keeping her on this earth for so long: teaching his hero, the Chosen One, how to triumph over the dead. And so in peace she goes, relieved from her past and knowing she had fulfilled her part in the Lord's plan. 
___
But Melisandre was right. The situation is desperate. Dany understands this and is willing to sacrifice herself for the good of mankind. Or everything would be lost, forever. Jon knew it as well.
___
But Jon Aegon Stark Targaryen, stands for all that is good in this world. His heart is one of the few that is truly pure. In spite of all, in spite of knowing what would happen to the living, Jon cannot do it. Jon cannot bring himself to stab the women he loves and the mother of his unborn child. 
___
So instead, he decides to go with Jaime on one last suicidal mission: seeking the help of the Crown to unite the living and convince Cersei to join their cause, again. This time getting himself arrested. 
___
When hearing about this madness, Dany marches her armies to King's Landing and threatens to attack the city if her King is not released. Jaime urges Cersei to release the one man that could help mankind survive but Cersei refuses and chooses to fight instead. Except she knows full well she cannot win. She plans on burning the city with wildfire rather than let Daenerys savor victory. As Dany attacks, Cersei is about to give the order and have everything be burnt down. Eviscerated by this folie, Jaime gathers all the strength he can find to bring himself to stop Cersei from pronouncing the words and ends up strangling her to death. *The Valonqar prophecy has taken its toll.* 

*Ironically, the house that had put family first ended up getting decimated by its family.* 
___
The Mountain kills Jaime while he kills Cersei. With her dying breath, Cersei orders her guards to kill Jon Snow and so he dies. The Mountain and Brienne enter the room while Jaime dies in her hands. Brienne realizes Jaime has saved King's Landing from annihilation, again. Once from the Mad King by sacrificing his honor, now by giving up his life. Ensues Cleganebowl.
___
*A shadow comes close to Jon's corpse and picks up the Valeryan steel dagger.* 
___
As the Dothraki hordes are killing, pillaging and raping around in King's Landing. Dany arrives at Jon's cell and sees his corpse lying on the ground. 
___
The biggest hero in the series/Father of her child/Targaryen/only man that can stand up against the Night King has been murdered. Dany loses it. Consumed by the need for revenge and justice against the people she deems responsible, she lets her anger out and her dragon(s) loose. Everyone responsible for Jon's murder and then some will be killed on top of burning down a good chunk of the capital. 
___
The Golden Company is burnt to the ground. Once in front of the Iron Throne or sitting on it, Daenerys will finally get herself back together and will realize what she has done. Cue the vision at the house of the Undying. In this moment where her guard is down, from the shadows will appear our  *""reborn""* backstabbing hero, Littlefinger; killing the foreign invader/mad King's daughter/ mass murderer of King's Landing with his Valyrian steel dagger thus saving the inhabitants of the capital.
___
But this time, nobody seems to be getting resurrected by the Lord of light...

**The Fate of Bran Stark**
-
Witnessing this massacre and realizing all hope is lost, Bran wargs into Drogon (the other dragon probably dies during the battle of Winterfell), and with the help of Beric Dondarrion (who likely saved his life at Winterfell) flies to the Isle of Faces, the center of all weirwood trees in Westeros, to try to change the past… 
___
We know from poor Hodor and from the Three-Eyed Raven that in Game of Thrones, the past is a closed loop. Bran also knows it. The ink is dry, the past has already been written and it cannot be changed. But given how dire the situation is, this final desperate plan is understandable. At the Isle of Faces, Bran powers are amplified to such a degree that time flows incredibly much slower in the present compared to within his visions, giving him an insane amount of time to try to find a solution before the Night King arrives at his location. 
___
The first event of importance Bran goes back to is the resurrection of Jon Snow. Surely there will be a display of power from the lord of light to be witnessed there since he knows for certain a miracle is due to happen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6j-60Td0a4&amp;t=154s (2:34 - 8:11). Bran patiently waits and observes as Melisandre applies the lotions and performs the ritual to resurrect Jon Snow. But for 2 long minutes, nothing happens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6j-60Td0a4&amp;t=327s (5:27 - 7:51); and at 7:51, everyone but Ghost gives up and leaves the room… 
___
Seeing the lord of light does not seem to care about Jon's life but knowing how crucial he will be in the future, Bran tries to resurrect the man himself... and succeeds! Except Bran does not really have the power to resurrect people. What he did was animate the dead parts of Jon's body (which is likely less than 10% of his body at this time) with his magic. 

Jon is now a moving being that is 90% alive and 10% fueled by Bran's abilities. This is why after being resurrected, he says he does not feel the same (cause he isn't, he is less alive than before). At this point, Bran realizes his magic is so strong that it can power dead bodies into moving again. The truth is the way Bran revives people is very similar to the way the children revived Benjen, when they left most of his conscience in him. Both Jon and Benjen are animated in part by the power of the weirwood net.
___
D&amp;D managed to make you believe the 2 minutes of void from ""5:27 - 8:11"" were solely here to build up the tension but in fact, it was the time it took Bran to understand he was needed to bring Jon Snow back to the living. 
___
At this very moment, Bran realized there was no Lord of Light, or if there was, he wasn't the one resurrecting people that would help with the war against the dead. He was.

[LEAKS] End Game Theory (part 2/3),"**The Lord of Light**
-

After witnessing this, Bran started screening the past for similar prayers to the lord of light in order to keep alive people that would be of great importance in the final war. Thus resurrecting Beric and others as many times as needed (that’s why Beric is being resurrected very quickly compared to Jon’s revival, because Bran is not hesitant anymore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wboON-Z-eqI&amp;t=8s [0:08 - 0:34]). Going 400 years back to keep Melisandre alive, giving her a prolonged life so she would be alive in the future to guide Stannis to the North and save the Night's watch and Jon Snow from the wildlings crushing them at the battle of the Wall and so on.
___
And now, you understand why Lady Stoneheart is closer to a zombie than to a human being. Because she was revived  so late after her death that most of her Brain &amp; her body had died. Only vengeance remained in her. In the same way, poor Beric being brought back 6 times does not even have blood left in him and his body is mostly animated by Bran's powers. But at least, most of his brain has remained intact through all of his deaths.
___
Bran had learned he could use his powers through time but not yet how to communicate with people in the past. He knew that he could not warg into them or he’d turn every Wylis into a Hodor. So he tried to let the believers of the lord of light know they should prepare against the dead by letting them see parts of his visions through fire (e.g. the visions Melisandre, Stannis, Beric, Kinvara &amp; Co.saw in flames). Thus effectively showing them part of the future. But this form of communication was not amounting to much as the visions were subject to many interpretations and not clear enough for everyone to rally behind one strong message: prepare for the fight against the dead.
___
So on his third trial, instead of trying to warn everyone about the army of the dead, Bran realized it would be wiser to focus all of his energy on explaining things to one person at a time. And if you are going to focus your efforts on one man, better make it a king, as convincing a king would equal to convincing everyone. To this end, he goes back to the nearest time where the 7 kingdoms where most united and the Whitewalker threat still minimal, before the war of the 5 kings, even before Robert’s  Rebellion: the era of Aerys II Targaryen. 
___
The period when Aerys was taken captive and imprisoned proved to be the perfect opportunity for Bran, giving him enough time to talk to the King and explain the threat to him. But the visions Bran showed him through the fire next to his cell confused him. 
___
Bran realized he needed another way of communicating with the King. Then, he remembered what happened at the tower of Joy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcCawhWkwUg&amp;t=292s (4:52 - 5:40). Young Ned heard him. Not distinctly, but he heard him. And so Bran tried to speak to the King directly.
___
But it did not work. Even though Bran tried repeating his message over and over again, all the poor man could grasp was the wind whispering a few words that he later gathered into *“burn them all”*. This event caused Aerys to become paranoid and slowly drift into madness… Once again, Bran had turned another man’s brain into soup. At this point, you could even argue that Bran is the reason Robert rebellion started: had Aerys not turned mad, maybe he would not have burned the Starks thus preventing the whole rebellion from starting.
___
First Hodor, now a King… This is when Bran fully grasped the dangers that come with not knowing how to control his powers. As we all know, *“with great power comes great responsibility”*. 
___
___
___
**Aerys II, A Targaryen Mess**
-
After this first traumatic encounter with Bran, Aerys did not turn mad all at once. But soon after he returned to King's Landing, new visions started to appear through fire and Aerys started hearing voices again... Except this time, it was an entirely different voice talking to him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj55XNXJztY. This new voice and these news visions were Brynden Rivers', aka Bloodraven, aka the Three Eyed Raven. Brynden was trying to use the powers he had recently acquired through becoming the Three Eyed Raven to let Aerys know how to get rid of the Blackfyres for good.
___
To this end, Brynden showed Aerys repeated visions of Varys living in Essos, in an attempt to let him know he had to kill Varys to get rid of the rebellious Targaryens, the Blackfyres. 
___
Except interpreting visions is a very confusing task, just like trying to understand prophecies. Because when you try to come to a conclusion without sufficient information, your interpretation will be as flawed as anyone's (unless you are very lucky). *This is exactly how we manage to believe Ser Pounce could be Azor Ahai and Varys a Merman.*
___
So instead of having Varys dealt with in Essos, Aerys thought the visions were telling him that the master of spies would be of great help. Instead of executing him, Aerys had Varys brought to his court. This is when Brynden Rivers, aka the Three Eyed Raven, realized visions were not enough at all to convey his message. In this case, visions had had the opposite result from what he intended. Varys, on his end, had surprisingly found himself disposing of Aerys's trust while being in the perfect place to plot the return of the Blackfyres in Westeros. All the while convincing people his only intentions were to work for the good of the realm and the well being of the people (a deception not difficult to pull for the master of spiders, as he had been raised by a troop of actors).
___
Brynden had to act! He started relentlessly talking to Aerys on top of the visions, telling him to burn Varys, to burn his spiders, and to burn the Blackfyres.
___
No wonder Aerys turned Mad and paranoid. Even the healthiest man would have gone nuts after seeing visions of people and things he needed to burn while hearing indiscernable whispers that would not stop for years and years. Not to mention that his paranoia was continuously fueled by real whispers, the ones from a man Aerys trusted, Varys himself. Conspiring all along to weaken Aerys's reign and to weaken the peace of the realm so Aegon's invasion of King's Landing could be facilitated and perceived by the public as a saving act. And given that these visions and voices came from 2 different people (first Bran, then Brynden) with 2 very different agendas, even the mentally strong would have gone insane if they were not able to explain what was happening to them or what it all meant. 
___
After this tragic series of events, Brynden Rivers had witnessed how he had failed his King and caused the downfall of the ones he had tried so vividly to protect. All that was left for him now was to learn from his mistakes and try to help the children and the grand children of Aerys to reclaim their rightful throne (without using visions or whispers this time). To help the rightful heir of the Iron Throne, Jon Snow, he warged into Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's raven back at the Wall to influence Jon's destiny. While having Euron help Daenerys across the narrow see in the hope of seing both Jon &amp; Dany rule from the Iron Throne as King &amp; Queen.
___
Except after having enjoyed these new powers for a while, Bryndon had found himself completely trapped into the roots of the weirwood tree. But it wasn't just his body that would not move anymore, his will had been affected as well, slowly being bound to the will of the Children of the Forests...Until he had finally turned into their puppet.

**The Training**
-

Back in Bran's journey through the past, Bran understood he needed to master his talents if the living were ever going to have a chance at fighting the dead. And who could possibly help Bran complete his training if not the man that started training him in the first place, the Three-Eyed Raven. 
___
And so, the Three-Eyed Raven trains Bran and helps him fully master his powers.
___
But remember, neither Bran nor the Three-Eyed Raven (=TER) can see the future so how did the TER know so much when he meets Bran in season 5/6? He knew because he had met Bran at this moment in this past and Bran had shared his journey from the future with him, by uploading visions of his experiences into the weirwood net. This is why in season 6, Bran sees some parts of the future (like Drogon flying over King's Landing, the Mad King's saga, etc.). These are in fact the visions Bran had first shared with the TER at this moment back in time that are now being shared back into his younger self by the TER. *(a bit confusing, I know)*
___
And this is why the Three-Eyed Raven knew that he needed to call and guide Bran after Jaime pushed him through the window. This is why he knew Bran would come at some point in the future and that the first thing he says to him is that “he was waiting for him”. This is why he knew that Bran would fly: because Bran himself told him that he flew Drogon to come to the Isle of Faces. This is why he knew when he would die and looked so prepared. And this is why the Night King looked like he knew him (he does cause the Night King is Bran). 

*This is also how Melisandre knew Varys would die and burn in flames, because the TER had shared this vision from Bran's memories of the future with her.*
___
In our present timeline, to convince Jojen to join their side, the TER transferred some of Bran's visions from the future to Jojen. But like Jojen said, he is not a greenseer himself. So the TER had to warg a bit into Jojen's mind each time he needed to transfer a vision in him. To do that, the TER used a warging ability similar to the one Bran used on young Hodor, except with a much lesser amplitude. This is why with each vision, a small part of Jojen's brain is being destroyed and why the boy had mild strokes and blood coming through his nose after seing parts of the ""future"".  

___
After mastering his powers and having acquired an impossible amount of knowledge, Bran is now able to warg into people from different timelines and can fully control their bodies in order to interact with other humans from that timeline. 
___
But there is a severe cost to it. Remember what warging for 2 mins into Hodor did to his brain? It half destroyed it. So in order to successfully warg into a host and interact with other people from that timeline, the host’s brain has to get completely fried and Bran has to stay in that body until it dies… So this is not a power Bran can simply use whenever he needs to as not only does he deliberately have to take a living being's life. But like the TER said: ""Stay too long where you don't belong, and you will never return""; it will also bind Bran's spirit to that host until the body dies (or until Bran suicides the host).

**The War For The Dawn**
-
Through visions and with the help of the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran realizes that Bran the builder and every other major figure in the history of the war against the dead has been him warging into someone from that timeline. He realizes that in order to stand where he stands today, he has to go back in time and rewrite these stories the way they were once written. And so he does.
___
Through warging into many lifetimes, Bran helped men and the Children build the wall, helped build Winterfell, shared his knowledge and armed the first men with obsidian glass/dragon glass. He also founded house Stark (probably through warging into Bran the builder and getting down to business). 
___
Most importantly, he was there 8,000 years ago in a fight long forgotten, the War for the Dawn. But contrary to the fight lead by Jon Snow, this time, the living were united and fully prepared (Children + First Men + Bran + A  great hero, known as Azor Ahai). So the greatest alliance ever assembled fought and defeated the dead.
___
Let's take a moment to talk about a confusing drawing however, the one drawing of a Night King in the cave where Jon &amp; Daenerys go during s07 that looks nothing like the current Night King: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=199&amp;v=LJnMJc6Xgs0&amp;t=218s (3:38). Does this mean the Night King the Children &amp; the First Men were fighting at that time was different from the one in present day? 
___
To explain this, you need to understand that there has never been one single Night King to rule all White Walkers. There are 3 types of undead beings that constitute ""The Others"" : 1) Wights, that are raised and controlled by the Whitewalkers or the Night King; 2) White Walkers, controlled by a Night King, with the ability to raise Wights; and 3) Night Kings, a more powerful White Walker with the ability to create Whitewalkers from the living.
___
It is safe to assume that during this ancient time, being at war with men, the Children created many Night Kings at the same time, each having the ability to create his own army of White Walkers and Wights.  
___
This is why you can see drawings of a ""Night King"" that looks nothing like the one in our present because there were plenty different Night Kings, each being a different individual with his own army.
___
But all of them were defeated and destroyed during this War of the Dawn.
___
However, even the brave first men, with the help of Bran and the magic of the Children of the Forest could not get rid of one last Night King (the one sharing Bran's spirit). Dragon glass would not work, Valyrian steel would not work. No magical spell known to men or to the children would work. Even the legendary Lightbringer, mythical sword of Azor Ahai, would not work. The Night King body would recompose itself from ashes and dust every single time after being destructed. 
___
This is because the spirit of Bran, that lives in a timeline 8,000 years in the future is the backbone holding the body of the Night King together. And as long as Bran's body in the present timeline is not destroyed and/or the source of magic that moves the White Walkers is not destroyed, the Night King cannot be erased. But nor Bran, the first men or the Children knew this (as we see again, knowledge here would have been power). 
___
So Bran and the Children settled with sealing the Night King instead, far away in the North, beyond the Wall: where the Children could maintain the seal strong through generations; and where men would be protected when the threat was to reappear. 
___
And in case the Night King &amp; the White Walkers were to ever cross the wall in the future, Bran left a duplicate of the seal in the Crypts of Winterfell, identical to the one that had once stopped the Night King. Hence the saying ""There must always be a Stark in Winterfell"". A Stark would know how to defeat and seal the Night King. Unfortunately, that fundamental knowledge got lost in time, even to the Starks themselves...

**The Night's King, A Revenge Best Served Cold**
-
The Night King was created far before the Night's King ever existed. The Night King turning against its creators is the reason the Children sided with humans and decided to eliminate all the white walkers during the war for the dawn.
___
And during that war, there was one great hero, known as Azor Ahai. Bran knew the Night King could not be killed by anything but Lightbringer reforged as he had already witnessed Jon's failed attempt at stabbing the Night King during the battle of Winterfell. So he convinced Azor Ahai this was the only way to save mankind from the Night King's threat. And despite it breaking his heart, the man agreed to do it. Azor Ahai sacrificed his beloved wife for the greater good, by plunging his sword through her chest to forge the sacred Lightbringer. 
___
Expect it did not work. Sacrificing his wife did not amount to anything as his sword never became more than a flaming sword. And the so called forged ""Lightbringer"" was not able to get rid of the Night King either. So in the end, this poor man had killed his wife, Nissa Nissa, with his own hands, for no reason at all. Haunted by guilt, he joined the Night's Watch and later became the 13th lord commander. 
___
After the peace treaty between Men and Children was signed, the WW defeated and the Night King sealed far far away North of the Wall, a small fraction of the Children that were against peace with men decided to rebel. They knew about the torments of the 13th lord commander. So to manipulate him, they revived his beloved wife, Nissa Nissa, in the same way they revived Benjen on the show (leaving what was left of her conscience within her, so she'd be able to kind of think, remember and talk to her husband). Except Benjen was alive when he was turned and Nissa Nissa was not. This is why she has blue eyes. You can think of her as some sort of Lady Stoneheart, had she been revived by the Children instead. A small part of her former self remained, but most of her conscience had died.
___
Consumed by remorse and guilt over having killed his one true love for nothing, the 13th lord commander sided with the rebellious Children so at least, he could be with Nissa Nissa (or what remained of her), thus becoming the Night's King. In exchange for bringing back his wife, the Night's King supplied human sacrifices to the rebellious Children so they would turn the bodies into a new whitewalker army. With these whitewalkers, the rebellious Children intended to start another war against men (men that were cutting their trees and breaching the agreement by taking there sacred forests).  
___
But the mascarade quickly took a bad turn. The King in the North and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces to defeat the Night's King, the rebellious Children, and the new whitewalker threat they were harvesting.
___
In the end, by having the hero of the War for the Dawn, Azor Ahai, sacrifice his beloved wife for no reason,  Bran had indirectly driven the man into becoming a champion of the Others. Bran had created yet another monster that this time at least, he thought he had defeated. In an attempt to erase this huge mistake from history and preserve the legacy of Azor Ahai, Bran had all records of the 13th lord commander/Night's King destroyed, and uttering his name was forbidden, so it would become lost to history.
___
However, as Bran left the Night's King for dead after this event, a couple of rebellious Children found him half dead and turned him north of the wall into a white walker with most of his conscience left in him. In this state of existence, the same as Benjen in the show, he would be a good ally for them. He would become Coldhands. A whitewalker, with most of his conscience left, doomed to roam North of the Wall for 8,000 years without any chance at being reunited with his love Nissa Nissa, for only motivation to plot his revenge on Bran Stark.
___
And as they say, vengeance is best served cold (hence Coldhands). For 8,000 years, Coldhands had been waiting for Bran to be born. Back in present timeline, he could have killed young Bran when he met him North of the Wall. But what would be the point of killing a child that had not committed any crime yet? The best and most cruel revenge would be for him to help Bran &amp; Co safely reach the Three Eyed Raven and the Children. Ensuring that Bran would effectively complete his timeloop and commit these wrong doings in the past. And at the end of his time loop, after warging into the man that becomes the uncontrollable Night King, Bran would be the one to bring death and doom to the living he had sacrificed so much to protect. Coldhands would have made sure that Bran becomes the unstoppable force that would punish the living that had taken his love and his life from him in the worst way possible, by helping Bran safely reach the Children and the Three Eyed Raven.
___
This is why when Coldhands first meets Bran in the books, he says: he, Coldhands, is Brandon Stark's Monster (cause Bran created him by destroying his mental). And this is why Coldhands made sure to never reveal his face to young Bran, so that when Bran meets him (in his Azor Ahai/13th lord commander days) in his journey through the past, he cannot know that Azor Ahai would be the one to betray them and turn into the Night's King. By not revealing his face, Coldhands makes sure that history will repeat itself and Bran will complete his timeloop to become the Night King.
___
First Hodor, then Aerys II, a King, and now, the most legendary figure of all time Azor Ahai. Once again, Bran had messed up the past and people's lives because of his lack of knowledge.
___
Azor Ahai, the hero of the war for the dawn, the 13th lord commander, was the Night's King and is now Coldhands. The dead man that would make sure Bran would become the unstoppable Night King.﻿

**Dawn of the Night King**
-

Bran had seen what the future beholds. He knew that 2,000 years later, the Andals would invad Westeros, conquering the First Men and killing the Children of the Forest wherever they encountered them. Thus damning the seal that had concealed the Night King for two thousand years, to be unsupervised and forgotten. Abandoning it to slowly fade until the day the Night King would once again be free 6,000 years later.
___
Knowing this, Bran could have warged into the body of a different man to make sure the seal remained strong another couple thousand years but this was not a solution. All it would have amounted to was to delay the problem. And although time in his present had slowed down to a minimum, the Night King and his army had slowly managed to come close to Bran’s real location, at the Isle of Faces where they were about to kill him.
___
So if nothing worked and if the Night King could not be defeated, what was the last thing left to do for Bran? Prevent the Children of the forest from ever creating the Night King in the first place.
___
Even though he knows the past has been written and the ink is dry, because veritably all hope is lost and absolutely nothing known to the living works, Bran goes further back in time one last round and takes control of the body of the man that he has seen to become the Night King. Bran possesses this body and makes him run away as far as possible from the main Heart tree north of the Wall (where it all started), either to save this man or to have him kill himself and get rid of the possibility of the Night King ever appearing.
___
But the Children of the Forest still capture him and as much as Bran tries to convince them not to turn this specific body into a Night King Whitewalker, they follow through creating what would become ""the"" Night King. Blinded by their hatred for men (men that were stealing their lands and killing them), instead of listening, the Children turned Bran into a White Walker. Trapped and unable to kill himself in order to get out of this body, Bran’s spirit held within the body of that man turned into an uncontrollable White Walker that attacks both men and the Children. Thus losing almost all consciousness and turning into the strongest destructive being there would ever be, the Night King.
___
But in spite of all, one shred of his former self remained in this new Bran/Night King, his strongest will. The single conviction that relentlessly drove Bran’s actions throughout the many lives he had lived in multiple timelines: the drive to protect the living.
___
Time has run out...

**The Doom of the Children**
-
As a result, in an attempt to defend themselves against Man, the Children had created the weapon of mass destruction that would be their doom.
___
Let's take this moment to reflect on what their story was. Most people assume at first glance that the Children and the Three Eyed Raven were a bunch of nice magical beings helping Bran rid the world of the worst evil it has ever known, the white walkers. But is this really what they were doing? 

*(credit to Milos for helping connect the dots for the Children's storyline: https://us.blastingnews.com/editorial-staff/milos-kitanovic/)*
___
The Children's peaceful lifestyle and harmony with nature was first destroyed by the First Men invading Westeros and destroying their sacred trees. In a war where they were out-powered and outnumbered, the Children had to create the White Walkers, a weapon that would fight men and turn their numbers against them. 
___
Aside from these, the Children designed a few special white walkers, with the ability to create white walker generals and control their own army of wights. These are referred in the show as Night Kings (because they conveniently have what looks like a little crown on top of their head). This is why Martin has said he prefers the term Night's King. Because the Night's King is a real character whereas there has never been one single Night King to rule all the white walkers. The Children created many of these beings at the same time that went on to fight men for them. 
___
Even with an otherworldly army, after centuries of endless fighting, the Children were losing. On the other hand, getting rid of all the Children would have proved too high of a cost for men (endless guerrilla with Children turning the dead against them). So the wisest of the First Men met with the Children leaders and formed a peace treaty, the pact: an agreement that stipulated men would get the lands while the Children would get the forests. In the meantime, men would never again cut a sacred weirwood tree while the Children would erase White Walkers from Westeros. Thus were the terms of the pact agreed upon and the nature of the peace that followed for four centuries.
___
However, after enough generations had passed, as their civilizations were growing, some men started cutting down weirdwood trees again and invading forests.
___
Witnessing what they had suspected all along, the Children realized men could not be trusted and needed to be dealt with. So in response, they secretly harvested a new army of white walkers in the North.
___
To this end, the Children kidnapped humans. Some were used to create Night Kings, others were turned into White Walker generals by their Night King. 
___
After enough time had passed, rumors and whispers had taken root in villages. Why were so many people disappearing lately?
___
To investigate the matter, the Lord of the North led a ranging party with some of his most trusted men. When they found out the Children had been creating a new White Walker army, they were infuriated and enraged by this traitorous act. The brave Lord and his men attacked the Children, ultimately leading to the lot of them getting captured.

___
But one of his men had Bran' spirit warging inside of him and when the Children turned the Northerner into a NK, he went out of control and attacked his creators. The Children tried to get rid of the failed experiment but they could not destroy the body of that NK. Nothing was working and the more the Children were struggling to fight this NK, the more his army of rebellious white walkers was growing. Soon, the threat had gone disproportionate and out of control.
___
To avoid getting whipped by their own creation, the Children went south to ask for men's help. But the Children made sure not to tell men the truth. Instead, they lied and covered their treachery with the story of a massive White Walker army that had appeared out of nowhere to wipe out the living.
___ 
Soon after, Children and Men had joined forces and had defeated the White Walkers in the War for the Dawn. 
___
The Children had no idea why this particular Night King went out of control. And they had now seen how dangerous it could be to manipulate the dead. On the other hand, the new leader of men had left quite an impression on the Children. They could not deny how well intentioned and knowledgeable their peaceful King, Bran Stark, seemed to be. Therefore, the Children agreed the wisest thing to do was to give peace a second chance.
___
But they had already been there before: having to put their faith in men, again. And they had seen what it had led to: betrayal. Convinced there could never be peace with Man, a little group of dissident Children decided to start another army of white walkers. Hence the Night's King saga. But most Children still supported the peace treaty and after the Night's King incident had been dealt with, both Starks and Wildlings promised they would make sure the treaty would always be respected. And so it was for 2,000 years.
___
However, when the Andals invaded the first men and killed most of the Children, they had no regard for the Children's lives, let alone any pact that would have once stood.
___
Despite being slaughtered, the Children could not use the white walker weapon as they were as likely as men to turn against them. And they had not yet figured out what had gone wrong with this specific Night King.
___
So for 6,000 years, the Children searched for a way to save their race. As millennia passed, the Children of Westeros realized no matter what they would do, their specie was doomed and could not be saved. In the end, all of this was Man's fault. If not for men invading, they would have never created the weapon of mass destruction that nearly wiped them all. If not for men invading again (Andals), they would have never gone extinct. If not for men, their sacred trees that they believe to represent the after life would still be standing. Even 8,000 years later, Man was still the enemy, Man had always been the enemy... and Man had won.

**Valar Morghulis**
-

Back 500 years before our present timeline, the remaining Children in Westeros knew their end would come and had accepted their fate. But they could not resign themselves with dying while the crimes committed by men were left unpunished. Through all their time studying the Knight King, they had finally managed to understand what he was. They realized that most of his uncontrollable powers and his invincibility came from another stronger spirit from another timeline in the future having been mixed and intertwined in the process. And thanks to history and the many encounters they had had with one particular warg, they realized only this sorcerer coud have been strong enough to create such a mess: Brandon Stark.
___
To punish men, there was one last unstoppable weapon they knew they could release. A weapon that could not be stopped. A weapon that would ensure their revenge on Man even after their extinction: the Night King.
___
But releasing the Night King would have resulted in a failure as the knowledgeable Valyrians and their thousand dragons would have wiped out any white walker threat in no time, no matter the size. Therefore, they had to get rid of the Dragons first.
___
A century before Aegon's first landing in Westeros, just like they had once shattered the Arm of Dorne, the Children destroyed Valyria by creating a cataclysmic disaster. An event that came to be known as ""the Doom"": laying waste to the Valyrians, their capital city, and its surrounding lands. The peninsula itself was shattered. Every dragon was thought to be lost... as were the Valyrian spells, knowledge, and recorded history.
___
But this was not enough, as there were still many books, scrolls and other manuscripts laying around the world that would help men fight any White Walker threat. The Children could not risk wasting their last ace without having first maximized the Night King's chances at erasing mankind. On top of that, a handful of Valyrians and Dragons had also survived the doom of Valyria and had proceeded to conquer Westeros and create a new realm for Targaryens and Dragons alike to prosper in, the Seven Kingdoms.
___
Getting rid of these hurdles would have proven too big of a challenge for the Children alone. And they knew it. They needed allies inside the realm of men if they were to ever accomplish such miracles. 
___
To do so, even before the Doom of Valyria, the Children created a religion of death worshipers, the cult of the Many Faced God. And what better allies to start your cult with than the thousands slaves, being worked to death under the great volcanic mountain chain, whose eruption could even cause the destruction of Valyria? 
___
These slaves, from a hundred different lands, faced death on a daily basis, all so their Valyrian masters would enjoy their wealthy lifestyles. This proved the perfect starting point for the Children. Disguised as men, the Children taught these faithful men how to bring the gift of death to others: first, to their brothers in pain to end their sufferings, then to the slave masters themselves... In exchange for having shared a bit of their magic and knowledge with those broken slaves, the Children had acquired a legion of faithful servants which would later become the Faceless Men: skilled assassins, acting under many disguises, under many names and many faces, as *No One*.
___
These broken slaves were ready to turn into perfect mindless weapons serving the Children's agenda. If this way of proceeding sounds familiar, it is because this is how the Children used the First Men during the Age of Dawn. Back then, they were turning men into obedient white walkers against their will with the help of magic and dragon glass. Now, they had found a much safer way: let the mentally weak and the broken willingly turn themselves into their faithful servants (just like the 13th Lord Commander/Night's King had once done). These people would brainwash themselves in the hope of finding a higher purpose to their existence (i.e. serving the will of the God of Death, which is really the voices of the Children).
___
*This is exactly the mental state Arya was in when she first joined the cult: a completely broken girl, the perfect target for the Many Faced God/Children. Had it not been for her obsession with her list of names and for the last bit of Arya Stark resurfacing at the end, she would have lost herself completely to this higher cause, in one final attempt to find herself a pack to be part of.*

*And this is why Martin has said the Faceless Men have been around for thousands of years. The cult of the Faceless Men did not exist 1,000 years ago. But the Children disguised as men did (aka the original Faceless Men). And they had been roaming around the lands of men for thousands of years.*
___
In time, the slaves started blindly obeying the will of the Many Faced God (i.e. Children passing as the voices of the god of death): *Valar Dohaeris*, ""All men must serve"". As this god had been the only one answering their prayers and offering them help when they needed it most.  
___
With centuries passing, the religion grew, slowly gaining more and more followers. When the time came, they chose the free city of Braavos to establish their main temple, the House of Black &amp; White. It was no coincidence that the Faceless Men had found themselves so close to the Iron Bank. This place was the closest thing there had ever been to a King of Mankind. Whoever had his hand on it had a strong hold on the fate of men. The Children knew it and by having their faithful servants establish to this key area, they would ensure Mankind would never find itself in a sustained state of peace or unity for too long. Thus maximizing division between the ranks of men and keeping mankind as weak and vulnerable as possible for the return of the White Walkers.
___
In the end, what had the Many Faced God ever been if not the weirwood gods worshiped by the Children? Just like the many faces sculpted into the weirwood trees. And while one would think ""All men must die"" referred to ""all men eventually die in time"". For the countless sins men had committed to the Children over thousands of years, the true meaning of these words had always been:

*""Valar morghulis, All men must be killed""*.

[LEAKS] End Game Theory (part 3/3),"**Justice for the Children**
-

With the help of their newly devoted faceless followers, the Children first orchestrated the Doom of Valyria, then the ""Tragedy of Summerhall"": a fire that caused the deaths of King Aegon V Targaryen, his eldest son, Prince Duncan Targaryen, and Ser Duncan the Tall, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. With this massacre, the Children got rid of the possibility of King Aegon ever restoring dragons to the Seven Kingdoms. This is also why Jaqen H'ghar and other Faceless Men had been working across generations to rid the Citadel and any other place from books or information that would prove key against the dead. And this is why in our present timeline, the Faceless Men had infiltrated the Citadel to find a way to get rid of Dany's dragons : so no one would be able to stop the White Walkers.


___
After 500 years of hard work, the Children had found themselves in the best environment possible for the return of the Night King. So roughly 50 years before our present timeline, Leaf &amp; the remaining Children released the Night King and let him loose on mankind.
___
The Children had eyes on lands through the weirwood net and were confident the White Walkers would rip men apart on there. But this was not enough... What about the seas? What was to stop men from simply fleeing by boat and never directly confronting the White Walker threat? Could the Children allow some men to live simply because they had found themselves on a ship when the White walkers were passing by? Never.
___
They needed eyes and allies roaming the seas. And which better allies than the Ironborn could you aim for? To this end, the Children had Bloodraven/TER (an obedient puppet by then), awaken &amp; train the powers of one particular Iron Born, Euron Greyjoy. No wonder Euron's assassin skills seem similar to those of the Faceless Men. As both the Faceless Men &amp; Euron were trained by the Children, either directly or indirectly through the TER. 
___
At first, Bloodraven had Euron retrieve Dragonbinder, a large dragon horn artefact with Valyrian glyphs that would allow Euron to make sure Dany's dragons would be controlled no matter the outcome. The plan was to bait Daenerys into a marriage like Brynden Rivers had initially wanted. But Euron never intended on helping her sit on the Iron Throne, he had better intentions. After having brutally murdered her, Euron would have taken control over her dragons and would have used them to burn Westeros down. After that, Euron would kill the dragons. Meanwhile, the Ironborn would think he was honoring their traditions &amp; lifestyle by pillaging and murdering around. While in truth, it was the perfect opportunity for the Children to weaken the realm of men from the seas. But the scheme failed as Dany showed no interest in his proposal.
___
On the other hand, the TER had Euron believing he was the Drowned God. And in order to be released from his human prison of flesh, he needed to capture priests from all over the world, to use as human sacrifices in a massive ritual. The lives of these men would have allowed Euron to cast one of the most powerful spells known to the Children: the wrath of the seas. 
___
Leaf &amp; co. had learnt through Bran's visit back in time that the Night King was destined to make it past the Wall, they knew the living would be defeated at Winterfell and would be at its weakest. Surely, some men would try to flee from the White Walkers by sea then. The Children could not let that happen.
___
Right at this moment, they would have had their faithful servant, *Euron Greyjoy, the ""first storm and the last""* sacrifice himself with his priests to cast the most powerful storm the world had ever seen: a blow so strong, than tsunamis, cyclones &amp; tidal waves alike would emerge from the depths of the seas, destroying every ship and drowning every man that would dare to venture over water. Except Euron had thought he'd be reborn into the Drawn God through this sacrifice, awakened alongside the Kraken. Little did he know.

___
___
But this was still not enough... For this plan to be unbreakable, Leaf &amp; co. had to make sure that young Bran would effectively complete his timeloop and would become the Night King. They could not let luck intervene with their plans. So to have Bran reach out to them and to guide him, they had recruited the Three Eyed Raven (a man that soon enough became more of a prisoner to the roots that had grown across his body than anything resembling free will). He then manipulated Jojen &amp; Meera Reed into thinking Bran would be the Savior. To help Bran safely travel North of the Wall, they recruited the dead being that had been fueled by hatred against Bran for 8,000 years: Coldhands (aka Night's King aka 13th Lord Commander aka Azor Ahai). PS. In the show, it's Benjen. We can assume it was not hard to manipulate him into thinking he was helping Bran by escorting him to the Three Eyed Raven and to the Children (the Starks have never been renowned for their intelligence: *""The Starks...Quick tempers, Slow minds.""* Peter Baelish, season 1, GoT.
___
The Children and the Three Eyed Raven knew the Night King would apply his mark on Bran and that they would die for it. But they were ready.
___
Their final unstoppable bomb against men had been planted. Nothing could now stop the wheel of fate... Or so they thought.

**A 10,000 year long journey, Bran the Undying**
-
As punishment for the sins he had committed by creating the Night King, Bran has to relieve all the events he had fought against through so many lives and so many timelines. But this time, from the other side, the side of the dead; While trapped in the uncontrollable body of his worst enemy, the Night King; And being the one inflicting death to the living he had so desperately tried to protect. 
___
And so the Greek tragedy ensues. Bran relives the War for the Dawn while knowing what destiny beholds and tragically witnessing how it could never be stopped.
___
After being defeated in the War for the Dawn and being sealed for 8,000 years, Bran had experienced 8,000 years of Hell on earth. Still, all this time, he had relentlessly been searching for an opportunity to redeem himself from his sins.

___
Bran knew he was trapped in an uncontrollable body that can either do one of two things: 1) kill  and 2) forever grow his army of killing machines (Wights) that will bring death, without limits. Bran had seen (during the eight thousand years he'd been stuck in the Night King) that he could not be stopped and could not be destroyed by anyone or anything in the realm of the living. What could he do then?
___
He'd have to try to stop himself himself by using the only 2 tools at his disposal: 1) killing and 2) growing his army. As soon as he was freed from the seal that had been holding him for 8,000 years, he started assembling  an army of Wights and White Walkers that he knew big enough to be unstoppable by Jon Snow and Co. Second, he  killed and acquired a dragon to get rid of the Wall that was blocking him. Third, he had to march south to destroy his self and the power that fueled his existence, the main Heart tree at the Isle of Faces. In the meantime, he had  drawn down his destination using dead bodies so people could eventually understand his intentions, and hopefully move away from his path so he would not have to kill them on autopilot. 
___
However, in one last attempt to prevent history from repeating itself, Bran in the Night King tries to warn young Bran about the seal hidden in the Crypts of Winterfell:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI&amp;t=1295s (21:35 - 22:20); 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI&amp;t=1652s (27:32 - 28:10); 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4oMQAZ0OxI&amp;t=2417s (40:17 - 42:26).
___
On 3 separate occasions, Bran/NK warged into a crow inside Bran's dreams (as well as into Rickon's dreams) to try to lead Bran to the seal that had long been buried under Winterfell, right under Ned's statue.
___
He also warged into Jojen Reed's dreams in the form of this Three Eyed Crow to try to let him know about the seal:*""A crow was trying to peck through the chains, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them."", ACOK, Bran IV*

The Crow was telling him to dig under the crypt of Winterfell and retrieve this ancient Artefact.
___
Jojen ended up figuring out who that crow was: the ""Crow is you Bran"". Jojen was right, the crow was Bran indeed. Except 10,000 years older and trapped in the Night King's body. http://i.imgur.com/axIeR4I.jpg . Unfortunately, even Jojen could not put the pieces together and understand what the crow was trying to tell him.
___
On his end, Bran/NK had figured that if young Bran, Rickon or Jojen had managed to find out about the seal, when the time would come for Bran/NK to attack Winterfell in season 8, after Jon &amp; Co would have valiantly stabbed him with Valyrian steel, they would have a shot at stopping him for good by sealing his body. This way, Bran/NK would prevent Jon from dying by never having him go south to ask for Cersei's help. Thus preventing Dany from going berserk on King's Landing and dying. While also preventing young Bran from ever having to go back in time and risk turning into the Night King. It would break the timeloop and save many many lives.
___
Except it did not work as neither Bran, Rickon or Jojen could manage to understand that they were supposed to find something in these crypts, let alone learn about the seal's existence. So for the last time in his 10,000 year long journey, Bran/NK had witnessed how the past could never be rewritten.
___
And so he set himself towards his last mission: stopping himself himself. 

___
But how would Bran in the Night King stop himself since he can't attack or destroy his body directly? Well, he'd have to destroy both the living soul that is making him indestructible (by killing Bran's body in the present timeline) &amp; destroy the power that his fueling his existence (the main Heart tree at the Isle of Faces, connected to all weirwood trees in Westeros). By marking Bran, he'd be able to break any magical barrier protecting him and he'd know at every moment where to find him. That's why the dead will specifically attack Winterfell in s08e03 instead of marching south for the Isle, simply because Bran will be there. Once Bran's real body and the Heart tree are destroyed, the Night King and his army will also be destroyed, effectively saving the living from his threat.
___
(And that's why King's Landing will never be attacked by the army of the dead and people will never know how the threat disappeared, because the Isle of Faces is further North from King's Landing on the Westerosi map.)
___
Back in present day, the Night King and his army arrive in front of the soulless body of Bran. The Night King kills Drogon and Beric, destroys the source of power that has kept him bound to the White Walker curse and kills himself by killing Bran.
___
All White Walkers, Wights and the Night King die and fade to dust. The living have been saved by the dead.
___
So in the end, the Night King killed for no reason (because he could not control his body that acts on autopilot as a killing machine against any hostile living being) and he also killed for a reason (to stop himself from keeping on killing and destroying the living for eternity).
___
Like Martin said it would happen: ""Sauron (= the Night King) is defeated and the ring (= Heart tree at the Isle of Faces = power that fuels the dead) destroyed in the end""; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaFViB8mZ9I&amp;t=135s (2:15 - 2:30). But would you say the Night King was an evil person, like Sauron was in the LOTR?
___
That's where Martin's genius for creating morally complex and grey characters hits you: Bran/ the Night King was the most evil character ever created, acting for Good, with the most evil tools and methods imaginable, in order to save the living, from an evil he himself created, himself! He is the savior that redeems himself from the evil he created, himself. See how deep it is?
___
What at first glance looked like an obvious fight between Good vs Evil becomes in the end, a deep internal conflit between young Bran (=Bran in the present, immature &amp; quick to jump to conclusions) and wise Bran (= Bran as the Night King, more than 10,000 years old). As Martin always said: ""the only thing worth writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself"".
___
So in the end, all of the countless lives destroyed across 10,000 years were the consequence of one thing: Bran's and the living's lack of knowledge regarding the White Walkers.
___
Knowledge is Power. *And so we come full circle.*

**A Martinesque Ending**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERsd7cFCRY&amp;t=923s (15:23 – 16:09) Baelish: *“One of two things will happen, either the dead will defeat the living in which case… all our troubles come to an end or life will win out! And what then?""*
___

Back in King's Landing, people have learned that the army of the dead has vanished. No one knows how or why (since every witness at the Isle of Faces has died) but everyone knows Littlefinger is the hero that saved Westeros from the mad Targaryen invader. 
___
King's Landing has no more potential ruler left. Every Targaryen and Stark got themselves killed (aside from Sansa). Every Baratheon has long been dead (aside from Gendry the bastard) and every Lannister that is not a dwarf supporting a mad Targaryen is dead. The Tyrells are dead. The Greyjoys are dead. And the Dornish have never been an option and are dead anyways. Which credible character is left to rule?
___
The only man with experience that is regarded as a hero by the people of King's Landing. The man that saved the Lady of Winterfell from the Boltons. The man that is beloved by the current ruler of the Vale. The man that would sit on the Iron Throne to rule even the ashes. The man that was “reborn” to rid King's Landing of the dragon queen: Peter *“Littlefinger”* Baelish.
___
And who writes history in the end? The winners. 
___
If the GoT community was able to convincingly fit Ser Pounce into the prince that was promised/Azor Ahai prophecy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_277828913&amp;feature=iv&amp;index=17&amp;list=PLn6yDpEottdhisSEKJE3Sv5fpYQuej0Ju&amp;src_vid=Ge6VduBUJFo&amp;v=M7sh3rG96Ew), how hard do you think it will be for Baelish and the noble scientists at the citadel, or the faithful priests from the Lord of Light or the Seven to explain the end of the White Walkers and the rise of their new King in history books? Even if in truth, they have no clue what happened:
___
*“Our noble King, Paeter Belish, First of his name, King of the Andals, the Chosen One, Azor Ahai, etc., was reborn amid smoke and salt* (a burning King's Landing capital is the perfect place to find both of those) *to slay the mad Dragon girl with his ancient flaming sword, Lightbringer* (whether or not his dagger was in flames that time does not really matter as the fanatics in Westeros will make up a convincing explanation: her body was in flames or something). 

*And when all hope was lost, Azor Ahai saved us all from the long night and the army of the dead by single handedly defeating the Night King. But at great cost. The Hero had to sacrifice his one true love, Lady Lysa Arryn, who bravely gave her life, for the sacred Valyrian dagger to be reforged into the divine flaming sword, Lightbringer. And all darkness faded, the Sun appeared and smiled upon his face as all were saved through the heroism of the Chosen One. Long live Azor Ahai. Long live our King Peter Baelish. May he reign forever.”*
___
This, is the new lie that will unite the realm. A divine story that will bring peace to the 7 Kingdoms, under the reign of their heroic savior, Azor Ahai/King Littlefinger.

*""Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's ennemies. A story we agree to tell each other, over and over, until we forget that it's a lie.""* Baelish https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxlIraEV8n4&amp;t=112s (1:52 - 2:08)
___
Tyrion gets Casterly Rock. Littlefinger marries Sansa and unites the North and the South. Tyrion gives Bronn his two castles, the Twins. Gendry either goes back to rowing or gets Storm's End. 10 years later, we see a physically fit and agile young boy from a poor background struggling in the streets of Essos, a boy who has had to fight to make his way in the world. This boy is the true heir to the Iron Throne, a little orphan who may become the Stallion Who Mounts the World. This boy had been saved and smuggled to Essos by Missandei after the death of both of his parents, Jon Snow &amp; Daenerys Targaryen. 
___
Sam sits down and starts writing the song of Ice &amp; Fire for history to remember. By the time he has become an old man, Sam is still writing the books with Gilly by his side as he now looks like the spitting image of George R R Martin (cue cameo with GRRM &amp; his wife Paris Mc Bride *[who actually has red hair like Gilly]*: http://www.zimbio.com/photos/George+R.R.+Martin/Paris+McBride).

[No Spoilers] Theory: GRRM is not allowed to release ASOIAF books until HBO finishes GoT,"I was talking about my roommate about GoT and ASOIAF today and randomly came up with this theory, but the more I think about it the more likely I think it actually is.

I think HBO made GRRM sign a contract stipulating that he would not sell ASOIAF books while GoT is on television. They probably don't want a competing product on the marketplace because it would hurt BLU-RAY/DVD sales.  In economic terms, ASOIAF books are a [substitute good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good) for the GoT DVD box set and it would likely make consumers desire the box set less if both of these products existed in the marketplace simultaneously.

Signing this contract was probably required in order for HBO to produce the show. Think about it: Why would HBO invest 100s of millions of dollars into a show and lose sales to a competing product?

It's good business for both HBO and GRRM: HBO gets to monopolize GoT for 8 years, GRRM gets free advertising and a wider commercial audience for his next book and they both make a ton of money. Everybody gets what they want without stepping on each other's toes.

It would explain why Winds of Winter is taking so long and why we hear practically nothing about it. He likely signed a non-disclosure agreement regarding information on his next book. HBO wants to funnel all the attention towards Game of Thrones right now. GRRM is under contractual obligation to be quiet about ASOIAF until GoT has run its course.

It would explain why GRRM has been publishing so many spin off and prequel series; he's not allowed to publish ASOIAF right now.

Many fans have noted that GoT feels rushed compared to the book series. It seems like they're just trying to finish instead of taking their time and telling the story properly, which doesn't make sense because HBO would have renewed GoT for as many seasons as D&amp;D wanted. It's the most popular television show of all time and there's plenty of source material. There's no need to rush telling this story unless it was  agreed upon in the contract that they would finish the show in a given time frame so GRRM could sell his books again.

It was agreed upon from the beginning that GoT would have 8 seasons, that's why they're rushing things and that's why they're making so many spinoff series. Otherwise they would be milking the show for as long as possible, but they can't do that so they are trying to capture some of that trajectory in these spinoff shows.

A Dance with Dragons came out on July 12, 2011, two months after the premiere of Game of Thrones on April 17th. It's possible that A Dance with Dragons was already slated for release before GRRM signed the contract or maybe they allowed him to release this one because he already had it done. Aside from that book which came out very early in season 1, we haven't seen a new ASOIAF book in the entire show's run. I don't think it's coincidental.

My theory is that Winds of Winter is already finished, and A Dream of Spring is at least halfway finished. Winds of Winter will be coming out holiday season 2020. That way Game of Thrones can finish by 2019 and sell ""complete package"" DVD boxes for holiday season 2019 without competing for Winds of Winter book sales.

[SPOILERS] I have a question about Cersei,"G.R.R. Martin promised a bittersweet ending. I thought about Cersei - she is hated in this moment and seems to become the ""mad Queen"". But she seemed ""evil"" just from the beginning of the show / of the books. So becoming the ""mad Queen"" wouldn´t be a big changing in her character. The fight between house Stark and House Lannister did beginn because Littlefinger killed Jon Arryn. Sure - Jaime threw Bran out of the window - that is not very nice - but Cersei and Jaime did that to protect their secret: the life of their children. Cersei was forced by her father to marry Robert Barratheon and Robert treated her not very well trough the years. Sometimes (while reading the books) I had the feeling, that Robert hates Cersei just because she is alive (and Lyanna not). Cersei was a good mother and everything she did was for her children. I think Bran can not hate her or Jaime - and that he understand. And I think, that the Starks will see Cersei in a different way, because they know now, that Littlefinger turned them against each other. Perhaps they will explain that to Cersei. In the beginning I thought that Cersei or the Lannisters did kill Jon Arryn, but they didn´t - and Tyrion didn´t try to kill Bran with that noble knife. This attack were made by Joffrey - a cruel blind child, who tried to please his father, who said that it would be mercy if Bran dies. G.R.R: Martin confirmed that it was Joffrey. So Jaime and Cersei didn´t heire a person to kill Bran (and they don´t know that Joffrey did it). At the beginning Cersei seemed to be evil and I thought she wanna destroy the Starks without any reason. But in her point of view the Starks threatend her without any reason. For her the start of that fight isn´t understandable because she don´t know about Littlefingers ladder of chaos. She got that prophecy that all of her children will die - and they did. All of them. That is so sad, because she wanted to protect her children with most of her actings. The death of her daughter was so sad, because Mercilla was a good person. And I felt kind of happy for Cersei, that she could revenge her daughter. Although the sandsnakes were fighting for Daenerys. Cersei got her revenge: she killed the sandsnakes and she killed Olenna (and soon she will find out through Jamie, that it was Olenna who killed Joffrey - not Tyrion or Sansa).

Don´t get me wrong - I am pretty sure, that history will repeat - and that Jaime will be the ""Queenslayer"" - the younger brother with his fingers around her neck - the neck of the ""mad Queen"". Sure she will have a miscarriage and get mad because of it. But I think, that this is a little bit sad. In the beginning I thought, that Cersei is evil - then I found out, that she was less evil than I thought and that she didn´t start that fight and that she just tried to protect her children - and then she will be the ""evil mad Queen"". I don´t like that evolving of her character. I would like to see, that she will do something heroic to rescue somebody. That she turns the golden company against Euron after her miscarriage. That the lost of this unborn child will change her mind in a different way: ""Why fighting for the iron throne? With no children left?"". That she will help the Starks against the White Walkers (that she follows Jaime). That she will choose Jaime (love) - to love Jamie and to choose her lover on her own and to be free without being commanded by a man were a big wishes of her. I hope that would become true for her. The only wish, that in that case wouldn´t come true would be a child of her own. But wouldn´t it be a bittersweet ending, if Jon Snow dies while fighting the White Walkers and if Daenerys would die while giving birth? And wouldn´t it be bittersweet, if Cersei would live and protect the child of them - so that she can be a kind of mother again - the mother of a child, that is not doomed to death? If that baby of Jon and Daenerys would be a girl - the prophecy ""a younger beautyful Queen will come"" would become true too. But it won´t be a threat to Cersei anymore. I really don´t think that this will happen.

But I would like to know, if somebody has similar feelings about Cersei? ""The villain is the hero of the other side"". Is there anybody who would like to see Cersei evolving in a different direction than the ""mad Queen""? Who wishes, that Cersei will do something heroic? And that at least a few of her dreams come true?

[SPOILERS] Daenerys' dragon dreams,"I don't remember if this was mentioned in the show, but in the books Daenerys experiences a phenomenon called *dragon dreams*. They're essentially strange prophetic-like dreams that many times involve dragons. A recurring she has, which started (by no coincidence I believe) on her wedding night, involves a black dragon.

Also, we've seen in the show how there's a non-verbal and almost telepathic bond between her and Drogon. Not only they seem to sense each other's presence, every time she experiences some form of emotional distress or her life is in danger, Drogon comes to her.

Which made me think. Is there a chance that dragons are telepathic, and her dragon dreams were an unborn Drogon's attempt at reaching out to her? ",gameofthrones,True,1522967314,2018-04-05
[SPOILERS] What will Gendry's big role be?,"So Joe Dempsie (the actor who plays Gendry) has recently stated that Gendry has a big role to play next season, What is that role...Besides forging Dragonglass weapons anyways. I say besides that because we know he will and I feel the important role has to be something more then just forging Dragonglass Weapons and possibly Valryian Steel mainly because I feel the way it's worded makes me feel like it is something besides that. Don't get me wrong I think he will Forge Dragonglass and possibly more Valryian Weapons and we may see him reforge his Hammer, but I think his important role will not be just that.

So here are some ideas for what it could be:

1. He dies- Okay No, No, No just because they say he has an important role DOES NOT MEAN IMMEDIATE DEATH. Okay yes maybe his important role could lead to a death maybe he has to sacrifice himself to save Arya or (In a Ironic and Poetic fashion) Jon, but I don't think Gendry will die they would not reintroduce him just to kill himself, and before you start Rickon and Osha are different due to them being Shaggydog stories.

2. He Kills Mel or something related to Mel- Okay so another thing that maybe this big role could involve Mel in someway, maybe he is the one who kills Mel or Mel will try to use him for a blood sacrifice again but this time burn him or take more amounts of blood, I hope not for that but maybe.

3. He is Azor Ahai/The Prince That Was Promised- Okay before everyone gets on my case about this, no I don't think it is likely at all but I wanted to mention it anyways. So another way of looking at it is that Gendry may end up being Azor Ahai, Being Reborn admits salt and smoke from...Um....Forging steel, and born under the bleeding star via the Red Comet, has the blood of the Dragon since his great grandmother was a Targaryen, Lightbringer may just be a Metaphor for Valryian Steel (with Nissa Nissa being misinterpreted), and he will awaken the dragon out of stone by....Okay yeah the theory of Gendry being Azor Ahai has some holes in it which is why I don't think it will be the Important role Gendry has in store but it still worth mentioning.

4. a Romance with Arya- Now his important role could actually just being a romance with Arya, Now for some reason people think it will be Sansa (which makes no sense by the way) but the more likely one is Arya, as they have forshadowed in more and it would be a better match then Sansa.

5. Mission to KL- I had a theory/Prediction awhile ago that Jon and Dany would decide Cersei and Euron need to be taken care of if they are to rebuild the world after this war, so they send Jaime, Gendry, Arya, The Hound, Brienne, and possibly Pod to go and deal with Cersei while Jon and Dany deal with the WW's. Gendry having an important role could support my theory as that would be very important task.",gameofthrones,True,1522971238,2018-04-05

[Spoilers] A Lannister Always Pays His Debts: A Theory,"It struck me recently that GRRM may have hidden an end game clue in plain sight. The unofficial Lannister house motto, A Lannister always pays his debts, could be directly referring to Jaime‘s debt to Rhaegar. 

As we know, Jaime has always felt the sting of regret for letting Rhaegar’s children be murdered. With Jon being Rhaegar’s last remaining child, perhaps Jaime will pay his debt by protecting him. That is, Jaime may ultimately lose his life in order to protect Jon, allowing him and Dany to rule the seven kingdoms after our story ends.

Full Disclosure: this fits with my [theory ](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6dx676/spoilers_main_ive_been_working_on_a_theory_about/) here. So I may be a little biased.

[SPOILERS] Storm of swords Sandor Clegane vs season 7 Sandor Clegane,"In Storms of Swords we are given a direct comparison to a scene in season 7. We are given a chance to see how much The Hound has changed over the period of time from Arya leaving him for dead to him venturing north in Season 7. In season 7 we see Sandor bury a family that he had left for dead (essentially) back in season 4. 

Back in Book 3, a Storm of Swords (pg. 887), however The Hound had a passage in Arya's chapter replying to Arya who has suggested they bury a dead soldier. ""Why? He don't care, and we've got no spade. Leave him for the wolves and wild dogs. Your brothers and mine. First we rob him though.""

Though I had realized how drastically Sandor had changed from when we first saw him till now, I had not realized that there was a scenario that repeated itself for exact comparison. His time with Ray seemed to have solidified some changes we saw him beginning to make while he was ransoming Arya. 

I love how often GoT has managed these scenes where you can see how much someone has grown and changed. It's a great throwback and every single one of these moments really make me smile.",gameofthrones,True,1523007630,2018-04-06

[spoilers] show only R’hllor theory,"Anyone else feel like the lord of light seems to show his greatest power to those who have given up on the religion, or all religion in general?
Thoros of Myr: failed drunken priest sent to Westeros to convert the new king Robert knowing good and well it wouldn’t happen. He won some personal glory with his flaming sword at the Greyjoy rebellion. But all but loses faith in r’hllor until the mountain kills beric, without thinking he says the words he’s said 100’s of times before and for the first time ever.. it worked!
Melisandre: believed whole heartedly in r’hllor, and was even able to produce some crazy magic with the shadow baby(I believe it was more blood magic then the LOL giving her power) but she admits twice she does not have the power to bring back the dead. Until.. she’s all but forced to flee for her life from stannis’ failing camp. She even takes off her glimmer at castle black, which I believe was her questioning what magic was actually keeping her young.. or if it was worth it. Then Jon dies and even tho she knows she can’t do anything she tries anyways...and it works!
The hound: my last example isn’t as solid, seeing as he never really believed in any religion. And even mocked the gods on several occasions. But due to being burnt by the mountain as a child stayed far away from flames and fire in general. Then Thoros convinces him to take a peak in the flames, and once again another non believer seems to have extremely accurate visions through the flames..

[Spoilers] Bran changed it all.,"No matter what happened in the 7 kingdoms Danny's story would've more or less stayed the same. If you think about this you can kind of get some insight as too what GRRM was thinking of the story as a whole.


Now lets say Bran would've never caught Cersie and Jamie in the tower then everything would've gone on like normal and Danny would've eventually taken over the 7 kingdoms and everyone including the Starks would've bent the knee to her. 

If Bran is the NK and he died after falling from the tower then the feud between the Lanisters and Starks would've still went down and all of the events as a whole Ned, Rob, Caitlyn's death, Etc. Danny would've still took the seven kingdom's.

In every scenario Danny would've still more than likely taken the seven kingdoms. Now what was done differently to hault her from doing so and instead fighing the army of the dead? The answer is Bran. If he is the NK and the events between he and the tower never happened, there would be no NK and no reason for Jon to go after the Army of the dead because the WW wouldn't exist just whights. In Jon not going after them because they don't exist then Danny would've never went to fight them too because they are no threat. She has been showing signs that she has a bit of her father in her with some of her unjust ways of ruling foreshadowing that she may not have been a good ruler. If the three eyed raven was sitting, waiting, and pulling strings for years maybe he saw this and decided to help set the events in motion for Bran to be the NK in the most elaborate game of all, because he new what it meant in the end for the seven. 

So why is this important to the overall story and how is it relevant. Because if there was no NK then Jon would've probably never seen the Iron Throne. The whole point of the story is only to stall Danny from the throne so Jon can take his rightful place and it all started with Bran. In the end if you think about it its not about anything else except the game. It's like its all wrote and mean directly for Jon Snow. 

(Side Note:) I believe Jamie is the TPTWP because it all started with him trying to kill Bran, and it will end with him killing Bran/NK like he was suppose to do in the first place. The beginning is the ending.

[Spoilers] What do you consider to be the most well-done fight sequence on the show?,"What I mean by ""well-done"" is how it was directed, choreographed, etc. Everyone has their favorite battle, but I'm looking for what people to consider to be the actual *best* in terms of filmmaking. I'm rewatching the series for the Xth time, and I noticed two things:

**1.** For as revered as it seems to be, the trial by combat in which we see Oberyn Martell fight The Mountain was kind of a poorly put together fight sequence. The story behind the fight is fantastic, and everything leading up to it, but with regards to the direction of the fight itself, it seemed sloppy. There were several cuts that took away from the action, most noticeably, Oberyn's showboating (which was awesome nonetheless, and very in line with his character). I just found it kinda peculiar that I'd remembered the fight with such awe, when in reality it was rather basic, in terms of filmmaking and direction.

**2.** The fight between Ned Stark, Howland Reed &amp; Co. and Arthur Dayne &amp; Co. at the Tower of Joy was just...breathtaking. It was, to me, exactly how a fight scene should be done. Specifically, after Dayne's companions are struck down, it's him with two swords against Ned, Howland, and the other two men they're with. The choreography of the fight was beautifully done, with The Sword Of The Morning donning two swords. The direction was absolutely fantastic; long shots caught all of the action without intrusive cuts that take away from what's actually happening.

Those just happen to be the two that come to mind for me at the moment, but I'm curious as to what everyone else's opinion on this is. What do you consider to be the best fight sequence of *Game Of Thrones*, with regards to filmmaking

**Edit**: Let's exclude the *Battle Of The Bastards*, which is obviously a fan favorite, and well deserved, to be sure. It was a masterclass in battle filmmaking. So, beyond the BotB, what do you consider the best?",gameofthrones,True,1523113639,2018-04-07

"[NO SPOILERS] Are there any plans to make versions of the episodes minus the nudity and if not, what program would be good to use to censor it for my friend who has an insane wife.","My good friend loves fantasy. Loves it. Game of Thrones is a show that he would adore, if he could watch it. Unfortunately his wife is absolutely bonkers. Years back she caught him looking at topless women on the Internet and she, no fucking joke, moved out and stayed at her parents house for two months. When she finally agreed to move back in, she would take the computer tower with her everywhere she goes in the trunk of her car. He wasn't allowed to be around it alone. This happened back in 2006.

 Here we are, 12 years later and he only just got a touchscreen phone, she had forbidden him from having them before, but he's not allowed to use internet on it, ever. I've mentioned the show to him before and he always mentions that the nudity would obviously send his wife into a berserk rage.

[SPOILERS] Parallels Between Jon and a Certain Dragon,"The dragon being Viserion, of course. 

Warning: this post contains some GRRM future book comments and clarifications that may apply to the show, and may spoil book readers looking to go forward completely blind. 


So it has largely been accepted that show Viserion is a wight, although what that means for a dragon still remains to be seen...beyond the increased speed and firepower, of course. 

We also have the possibility that Jon himself may be a wight, more specifically a fire wight, as strongly hinted at by GWWM through a comparison to Beric: 
""Poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this, every time he’s a little less Beric. His memories are fading, he’s got all these scars, he’s becoming more and more physically hideous because he’s not a living human being anymore. His heart isn’t beating, his blood isn’t flowing in his veins, he’s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we’re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing..."" 

Once again, there is a degree of ambiguity since 1) there is a chance some of that applies to Beric due to the fact that he underwent death and resurrection so many times compared to show Jon's once, 2) this may only apply to book Beric anyway, since Beric is less zombie like in the show than the books, and 3) exactly what transpires with Jon as a fire wight could naturally be different than Beric due to being of Targ descent (assuming the book doesn't diverge at the last moment) and therefore being inherently different...maybe even more if we assume Starks have their own kind of magic/otherwordliness as well, and 4) some of this could be reverseable, for Jon at least, through any number of events. 

Anyway, labels aside, at the very least show Jon experienced death and then resurrection, the latter thanks to the Lord of Light. We are led to believe that Viserion went through the same process, but through the Night King, and is ""powered"" by ice and winter. The Night King doesn't seem too worried about the husk of Viserion, as it is clearly damaged and decaying, while show Jon seems human. We also know he does experience blood flow due to any number of examples, from bleeding during battle to having an erection.

We have Jon, a Targaryen, turned possibly into a fire wight (and at the very least died and was brought back in some fashion), and Viserion, whose destiny has been tied to the Targs and other descendents from old Valyria, possibly turned into a wight powered through winter. Could they be foils to each other? Are they somehow destined to clash? To somehow rescue each other? Is it just more Ice and Fire imagery that GRRM and D&amp;D seem so fond of?

Am I overthinking this due to the extended break?

TL;DR: It seems possible Jon and Viserion are wights, with Jon being a fire wight and Viserion an ice wight, which may lead to some inevitable clash between the two or even a future affinity. Seems thematically appropriate, and demonstrative of the overall Ice and Fire symbolism. ",gameofthrones,True,1523243288,2018-04-08
[SPOILERS] Why does Bran care about Jon's identity?,"Hey friends, I've been wondering about this for a bit now so I figured I'd reach out and receive your insights.

Why does Bran, now dissociated from his human self, care about letting Jon know he's Rhaegar Targaryen's son?

I know Bran can't see into the future (at least not yet), so it can't be explained by something along the lines of ""event X in the future requires Jon knowing he's a Targaryen"". 

Why does Bran think there's this overwhelming need for Jon to know he is not a Stark and actually a Targaryen? I don't think it can be explained by Bran caring about the ""rightful heir"" ending up on the throne, since just about everything involving royal lineage is a not-entirely-rational human concern. The characters that cared about the ""rightful heir"" ending up on the Iron Throne were characters like Ned Stark, Stannis Baratheon, etc. Bran's entire character has revolved around the threat of the White Walkers. How will Jon knowing he's a Targaryen help with that threat?

What does Bran think Jon will gain from suddenly discovering that his entire identity is a lie?

I honestly can't offer plausible answers to these questions without resorting to something like ""Bran is God and knows the endgame and Jon being King is endgame"". But that hasn't quite been established.

What do ya'll think? ",gameofthrones,True,1523246109,2018-04-08

"[SPOILERS] - Bran Stark, the Three Eyed Raven and the Gods of Planetos","Some of you may have seen me commenting on this before throughout our many of season threads and many of you had me try and pick your theories apart, I now ask you to do the same with me. I have had a theory of sorts developing for a while and although I have never threw too much weight behind it I thought I would give us a break from the cosplays and bar men that resemble Ser Davos (they have a beard) and try and put my thoughts into word and see how it is received. I am in no way hell bent on this but I will defend my theory where I can, but as I don't want confirmation bias to be an issue I welcome critics of the theory. How else would we be able to explore it. 

The religions of Planetos are always discussed but generally most put religion in this world in the same bracket as our own, more superstition that real powers at work. So first of all I will look at one religion that does seem to have real powers at work. 

* Old God's as the Northmen call it. Wargs, Weirwoods, voices in the air it all sounds mad but we know for a fact that the Weirwood trees are a real network in which the Greenseers can almost travel through time. This is the religion of the North but we know it is not so much a religion but the interpretation of magic by the Northerners, the Children of the Forest, the 3ER and now Bran are a testimony to this as we know that the weirwoods are sacred to the Children and to men and they are a way for Bran to enact his powers and help in his struggle to be ready for the Great war. That is clearly the purpose of Bran, to be ready for the Great War which is evident in the new season as he has lost his humanity and only focuses on his 'time travel' clearly this is Bran's main purpose it is him who is to stop the Night King. Other notable figures in this 'religion' are Brynden Rivers and Jojen Reed. Both of these characters had the sight and more importantly both were destined to meet Bran and both were essential in helping to prepare him for his mission, so much so that each of these men gave their life quite willingly as long as it ensured Bran progressed to the next step. So even though these men have the ability to see they clearly acknowledge that **Bran is the most powerful of them and his mission is essential to saving the world.**

* Staying North of the Wall, this is not so much a religion but a real power and as it follows on well from the Old God's I will mention them next, the White Walkers. In the book we hear of the Great Other, in the show we have the Night King, the embodiment of death and the leader of the White Walkers who obviously has powers as he has displayed them many times by now such as his QB throw with an ice spear, apparent Greensight and the great power of reanimation. This is the antagonist power of the show with the eternal link to ice, the weapon of the Children gone wrong. This is basically all I can say on the WW for now as we will need some answers in the new season or the winds of winter(LOL) to shed light on the true nature of ice creatures. 

* The Seven - these God's seem to me as the least powerful of any God on the show and are really just interpretation of real world feelings, they match up with a lot of other polytheist religions of the ancient world in the way they are representations of fertility, war, death and other common real world issues. They are like the Roman Gods who are praised in the same style as the Christian real world God. 

* In this series where there is ice there must surely be fire, so I will go next to the mysterious God who has never appeared, has no real world representation except his priests but has shown actual true powers to exist, R'hllor. What do we know about the Lord of Light or from here on in LOL, well we know that he has priests who are enacting his work some of whom are powerless but some who seem to posses real power. Looking at his two main priests firstly with Thoros of Myr, we know that Thoros brought Beric back from the dead and in the books Beric was able to pass this life on to Lady Stoneheart but let's deal with the show for now. Melisandre is our foremost character who is linked to the LOL, the Lord has brought her to Westeros to help make way for the Prince that Was Promised. We know that Mel works of visions and voices from her Lord that aren't always easy to follow e.g. the Stannis fuck up, however the important thing to note is that she knew to tell Stannis that his goal was not only the throne but to travel North and help fight the wildlings and then to take back Winterfell so that the North was united. The most notable moment of Mel's is without doubt bringing Jon back from the dead, we know that she has no real power but for whatever reason she was able to bring Jon back from the dead, but how? Why? How can these two powerless priests be so special. My answer to that links heavily with GRRM stating that Jon and Beric (therefore LSH also) are fire wights. Now this was very specific terminology, he makes it clear that they are wights just like the what the army of the Night King or Great Other is filled with but these ones are fire wights, the army of the living. This clearly identifies the LOL as the opposite to the NK, he has made moves to counter the White Walkers, who else does that? **Bran Stark**. 

Looking at some other characters who have had interactions with the Lord of Light or his priests/esses, The Hound seen the arrow head mountain which was pivotal in the story, he travelled there with the Brotherhood (Thoros &amp; Beric), these men wen to the arrow head mountian with Jon who was already in high regard with the LOL and Gendry who is another one of our characters to experience the LOL. Varys heard something in the fire that changed his life forever, we are not sure what it was that was said but we do know that he played a huge part in Dany being fully equipped to take over Westeros, however it is clear that her main purpose for now is to fight the White Walkers and without her the living would fail so it seems that Varys life goal has coincidentally put a huge army in the North in time for the NK invasion, I am not saying that was Varys true goal but the voice that spoke to him, possibly (I will leave out mention of Aegon for the most part, but again a representation of fire). Stannis saved Jon Snow's life and made sure the wall would be defended a while longer so even though he was not our saviour he played a huge role in helping Jon. We also know the Mad King heard voices who many speculate is Bran and they were tied to fire, ""burn them all"". Arya, Tyrion, Euron (in the books), Sam, Brienne and others also experience the Lord of Light in their own minor ways, all of which are in the right place at the right time for the Great War. One more point on this is that Jon, Arya, Brienne and Sam are all in the North with Valyrian Steel. Jon is obviously essential to the LOL whether he likes it or not, Jon is seemingly our hero and the one man actively trying to turn everyone's attention away from petty bullshit and towards the Night King, he brought Wildings South, encountered the Night King, Took Winterfell and United the North and added 3 dragons to his cause and the Dragon Queen. This level of dedication to the fight against the WW is unseen in any character and in any God, except Bran and the Old God's. 

For me this is too coincidental that two powerful entities are working together to get the living ready for the dead, my counter argument and point of my theory is that they are not different they are the exact same and they are both Bran Stark interpreted in different ways. I believe Bran spoke in the flames to Varys, showed the Hound the arrow mountain, whispered to the Mad King and somehow brought Jon and Beric back from the dead. 

So humour me for now and say I am right, that would mean through the old God's Bran has been able to travel through time and whisper to people and as we know he can change time in certain ways. I theorise that Bran knows this and he knows how things must be for the living to win. He needed someone to help the dragon queen get to Westeros, he needed the Son of Rhaegar and Lyanna to be the PTWP and do all the things Jon did, he needed the 7 to go beyond the wall (for whatever reason I will let DnD answer that), he seemingly needs the VS weapons to be in the North and in the hands of certain characters. My thoughts are that Bran is the main power in this world, he as the most powerful Greenseer is the champion of the Living against the dead, his nemesis the Night King or as the books say the Great Other. Azor Ahai is the champion of the LOL to fight the Great Other, just as Jon is the champion of Bran to defeat the Night King. Bran I believe is one and the same with the Old Gods and R'hallor and that R'hallor is an interpretation of humans of the signs and voices which Bran (or maybe greenseers preparing the way for him) which has been thought of as the work of a God or in the Mad King's case thought of as just madness. 

I will explore one more religion before I go and it was a certain someone's (hehe) link to it which got the ball rolling about this theory. That someone is no one, Arya. Now this theory as I will call it for lack of a better term all started when Bran handed Catspaw to Arya, Bran made it quite clear he is not human anymore before this moment and this human touch of giving his sister a lovely present isn't really consistent. But he didn't give it to her as a present he gave it to her as he knows that at this point in time she needed to receive this dagger and as with everything else for Bran he knows it is essential in the Great War to come. That left me with a little feeling that it will be Arya who in the end will kill the NK, she already has a perfectly good and famous sword so why give her VS? She will kill at very very very least a White Walker but humour me again and agree with me it is the tool used to kill the Night King and win the war, it would make sense that Bran handed it to her but it would also salvage Arya's seeming wasted time in Essos. 

Arya needs to kill the Night King, so to get to the most well protected entity in the World she would need to be a master assas..... yeah you know where I am going with this. Bran I believe is a God in many cultures so you could say a many faced God. Jaqen H'gar mysteriously ended up close to Arya in captivity, he showed special interest in her, he gave her a coin, he trained her and he let her go but more importantly he let her go without any consequences which is strangely lenient. Many have complained about this plot hole and say that it makes Arya's story line seem wasted but if you take my word for it for arguments sake we know that Jaqen prays to the many faced God and that God talks back to him, these voices have demanded certain deaths that may be pivotal over the years but for once the many faced God could have told Jaqen to go to Westeros, train a girl, let her rediscover herself and then let her leave as a master assassin capable of killing the Night King and winning the war for the living. 

I know there are a lot of details to iron out, a lot of source work I can still work through and lot's more welcome criticsm before I can ever consider this a true theory. But I want to put this out there first and see how it is picked up by some of yourselves and I welcome you all to pick it apart and question it because that is the only way I will know myself if this holds any water. I will defend my theory where I can but am open minded to criticism and basically want to see if I am on to something or else just having major withdrawal. Thanks for reading. 

TL:DR - Bran Stark has been going through time to show signs, speak to people and move the chess pieces to ensure the living are ready to fight and beat the dead. These signs and voices etc. have been interpreted by humans as the works of God's, essentially making Bran the Old Gods and the New, the Lord of Light and the Many Faced God in his bid to defeat the Night King and ensure the survival of the living.

[SPOILERS] I was rewatching season 5 of GOT and found something interesting.,"Season 5 episode 9, Daenerys is in a very bad situation and is literally surrounded by the Sons of Harpy in the fighting pits. She looks in distress and clearly calls for help. Out of sudden she can hear Drogon's scream, and he comes and rescues her. What I find fascinating is how Drogon came into the play, a huge fire bursted into the air and he came out of nowhere, which makes me wanna ask, can dragons teleport from one place to another using fire ?

[No Spoilers] Did George RR Martin get the idea of Gregor Clegane and Sandor Clegane from the WWE,"I am not the biggest wrestling fan. I used to be during the Hulk Hogan and Giant era and than during the ECW, WCW and WWE era that was pretty short.

But sometime in the 90s there was a story line of 2 brothers. Kane and the Undertaker. There is only really 2 major traits Kane and Undertaker share with the Clegane Brothers. They are both two of the biggests characters in their universe and one of them had their face burnt and it is a defining part of their character.

You can also stretch out this dumb theory a little more with the idea that Sandor might be a grave digger and of course so is the Undertaker.

Thing is The Game of Thrones came out a year before Kane became a character in the WWF. But A Clash of Kings came out after. It has been a long time since I read the books so I don't recall which book Sandor's backstory was filled out.

But has GRRM ever mentioned he ever watch the WWE or any of his story line been inspired by it.",gameofthrones,True,1523299158,2018-04-09
[Leaks]Some Info on The Ending,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1523300188,2018-04-09
[Spoilers] - The Faceless Man's religion and philosophy appears to be lies. Otherwise the plot makes no sense. Here is my take on how and why.,"**The Faceless Men are trained to relinquish their former identities and become ""no one"", which allows them to become entirely different people, all in service to the Many-Faced God. They also believe that, as servants of death, they must serve above all else and that they must deliver upon certain people the ""gift"" of death.**

This philosophy in my view is deceptive at best and is tied into the ""Game of Faces."" 
You cannot willingly become an empty husk. You have to always have one identity at any time. Sort of a root identity. However you must learn to be an empty vessel when needed to carry many faces, along with many identities successfully and lie about it well. Observe how the Waif and Jaque hold on to such jarring individualistic personalities and emotions even though they are both no one. You have to discover this on your own through the Game of Faces.
Remember that there are two skills needed to be successful in the Game of Faces and to become a Faceless Man. 

a)	You must learn through observing clues if someone is speaking the truth or a lie.

b)	You must also be able to successfully lie without revealing any clues that will uncover your deception.

Throughout the entire plot Arya was hit by the Waif whenever she said, ""A girl is no one."" When questioned about her identity. This is a lie all the way as you cannot be completely no one.  But the objective is to belief in yourself that you are a no one in order to take upon a new identity. When you change back you will always retain some sort of root identity and generally your original self. If you can fool a well-trained servant of God (a master of deception) that you are a no one, then you are ready to become no one. But your identity does not completely disappear.
___________
**""Death holds no sweetness in this house. We are not warriors, nor soldiers, nor swaggering bravos puffed up with pride. We do not kill to serve some lord, to fatten our purses, to stroke our vanity. We never give the gift to please ourselves. Nor do we choose the ones we kill. We are but servants of the God of Many Faces.""**

This also completely contradicts what is actually observed and is a lie to be discovered. It is clearly shown that the Waif had a personal resentment towards Arya. The Waif has repeatedly shown wanting to harm and kill Arya. At the end, she was permitted by Jaqen H Ghar himself to carry her task of killing off Arya as a personal desire. Jaqen’s only request was to make it painless. Arya discovers this after killing the Waif.

I believe that when you are a trainee, you kill as you are ordered to. You do not change course and get distracted or have your emotions get in the way of a mission at hand. You do not steal a mask to run your personal errand. This is where Arya failed once again. However I believe that once you have become no one, you are also given the freedom to choose your victim as long as it is under the blessings of The God of Many Faces and does not get in the way of your service to the God of Many Faces.

At the end Arya understands that she has her root identity and personal choices. She came out victorious killing the Waif, a well-trained assassin. And she picked up on the contradiction thus now a master in the Game of Faces and emerges as a no one.

At the final goodbye in Braavos, Arya holds The Needle to Jaque’s throat and said,

Arya: You told her to kill me.

Jaque: Yes, but there she is, and there you are. Finally, a girl is no one.

Arya: A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell, and I'm going home.

Jaque nods in approval. Arya marches out to kill all the Freys and continues her mission that is her list.

"[SPOILERS] After years of hating, I finally gave in and tried the show again...","First of all forgive me if this isn't permitted by the community rules as I subscribed when I started and had to avoid this sub like the plague for a bit.

For years, I thought this show was overrated and never understood the appeal. I watched the first episode and didn't understand what they were saying, didn't remember anyone's names or which stupid house was which.

But a few years, closed captioning, HBO reading guides, and the main fucking character of season 1 getting his head chopped off and here I am.

It may be early, as I've just finished the finale of season 7, but dare I say this is new favorite show of all time.

So many incredible moments! From the Red Wedding (which totally caught me off guard), Joffery's bitchass dying, Ramsay's bitch ass dying.

The season 6 finale when the Sept blew up. Fuck there's so much epic stuff.

I see now why my friends were dying waiting for season 8... I really need to put more people I know irl on this so I can talk about it more!

[SPOILERS] A Theory on the Valonqar and More Beautiful Queen,"Now as we all know Cersei was told that she would be queen until a far more beautiful queen would cast her down, and in the books there is mention of another person who would bring her down known as the Valonqar whom would strangle the life out of her, Now yes I know that the Valonqar part was cut out of the show but that is not to say something similar can not still happen in the future, and I personally believe that Arya will be the Valonqar but also could possibly also fulfill the role of the Far more beautiful queen to cast down Cersei.

Now I will not talk too much about the Valonqar side of things but I will talk about her being the younger far more beautiful queen. Yes Arya is a child she can grow up, also Maisie Williams (the actress who plays Arya) has grown up to be attractive, also Maggy the Frog mentions she would also be younger, there has been a lot of hints and forshadowing for Arya being Queen, and finally Arya is said to look like Lyanna and Lyanna was beautiful.",gameofthrones,True,1523301704,2018-04-09

[Spoilers] Did Renly Know?,"This has been bugging me for a while - did Renly Baratheon know about Cersei's incest and the bastardy of her children? 

In the books, during his meeting with Stannis, Renly laughs and jokes about Stannis' letter claiming that. He calls it a clever move and jokes about the Lannister retaliation of claiming that Stannis sent his fool to service his wife. The way he talks about it, it seems like he sees it as a political ploy to legitimize Stannis' own claim. Which would indicate he didn't know about it and that he finds it hard to believe. 

On the other hand, its not in his political interest to acknowledge Stannis' legitimacy during this parley. By hinting that Stannis is as full of crap as him, he is kind of putting them on the same level and trying to make it about who has a bigger army instead of who has the better claim. 

*So while his statements hint that he didn't know, they don't prove it.* 


Take the other side now - a year ago, Renly was trying to get Margaery in Robert's bed. He showed Ned a picture of Marg and asked if she looked like Lyanna - clearly hoping that the resemblance would re-ignite Robert's passion for lost love. But resemblance to Lyanna would clearly not be enough. Robert wasn't going to simply discard Cersei - not when it'd such a great insult to House Lannister - and I doubt Mace would've settled for Margaery being Robert's mistress. Not to mention, even if Robert sets Cersei aside, Joffrey and Tommen would still in in line for throne ahead of any sons by Marg. Given that, the Tyrell hold on the throne won't be secure and once again, I doubt the Tyrells would've settled for that. 

IF Renly knew, then this plan would make sense. Once he has made sure that Robert is interested in Margaery, he can reveal Cersei's infidelity, get her, Jaime and the kids all killed, make sure Tywin can't do anything about it and then conveniently marry Robert to Marg. And ofcourse, Marg would raise her kids to love their ""Uncle Renly"" who, in due time, would be named regent or Hand and rule in all but name. 

But ofcourse, this isn't the only possible plan. Renly might've planned on Cersei being poisoned or the children having convenient accidents. Or he simply might not have thought that far ahead. Maybe his goal was just to get Robert to fall for Margaery and figure out the rest later. 


*Once again, this part hints that Renly knew, but it doesn't prove it.*

(Spoilers) Daenerys Targaryen Disrespect Thread,,gameofthrones,True,1523316210,2018-04-09
[SPOILERS] Daenerys Targaryen Disrespect Thread,"I just started rewatching GoT (I’m finishing season 2 as I write), and my hot, seething hatred for a certain character has been reignited. No, not Joffrey. No, not Cerci. The character I hate the most in Game of Thrones is Khaleesi and self declared Queen of the Seven Realms, Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen. Entitled, sadistic, and generally despicable are some of the words I would use to describe her, and it baffles me as to why some people would think that she is a morally good character (all of this is coming from a guy whose favorite characters include Tywin Lannister, Petyr Baelish, and Cerci) 
I’d like to start a list of her many terrible actions.   I wish I was more familiar with the books, though sadly my knowledge is mostly limited to the show. Feel free to add to this list in the comments.

Season 1: she’s relatively harmless in season one, though I think the seeds of her true nature are planted here. For one, she falls in love with Khal Drogo, a bloodthirsty killer and rapist who has been the direct cause of thousands of deaths. Her ability to overlook this “little” personality fault is a good sign that she is open to the prospect as well. 

Season 2: After dragging a few loyal followers to near death in the red wastes, Daenerys marches up to the 13 of Quarth and demands that they let her into their city. For the rest of the season, she continues to demand that the 13 pay for her fleet and refuses to sacrifice anything in return. By the end of the season, she has burned a man alive with a smile on her face and let another man and a woman she had known since episode 1 die in agony trapped in a safe. And all of this was in the name of her precious little children that she deserves to have so much. 

Just stared season 3 so I’ll have more later, but here are some random things I remember

Basically embodying the worst aspects of imperialism and totalitarianism (all this coming from a person who doesn’t hate either institution when used properly) 

Generally assuming that everything is hers by right, despite how little she’s proven to deserve it by virtue.

Being a terrible Queen of Mareen.

Burning hundreds of Lannister Soldiers alive in the Field of Fire 2.0.

Burning the Tarleys alive for not swearing fealty to her. 

Dragging hundreds of slave soldiers across the world because they had nothing else to live for when she offered them their freedom.

Friend-Zoning a man who deserves much better than her

Banging several men who deserve better than her

Banging her nephew who deserves better than her

And more as I keep watching

[Spoilers] A Song of *ICE* and Fire,"I have a theory on Lightbringer. Most people think its Jon's Sword Longclaw but im convinced 100% that it's Widowswail and Oathkeeper together and here's why. 

- GRRM got the idea of the whole story from the idea of a little boy seeing a beheading and finding direwolves. I'm not GRRM but how can you come up with this whole elaborate story just by this thought. Well I think Neds sword gave him the idea. Ned's sword was called ""ICE"" The title is ""A Song Of Fire and ICE"". So that means that sword is the most important piece of the plot. Stay with me on this.

- Now They made ice being melted down an opening scene for season 4 so its a huge deal. It made what we know as ""Oathkeeper and Widowswail"". Jamie has one and brieanne had the other. 

- I think to make LightBringer you have to forge them back together again to remake ""ICE"". 

- It's either going to be Jon or Jamie that will kill the NK in my opinion, but which one is the better candidate and which one works best for the story. Well they both do. 

- If Jon takes ""ICE"" and stabs it into Danny which is ""FIRE"" then it creates ""LightBringer"" which will be the way to kill the NK and end the long night. Breaking down the name of the new sword you could say It will ""BRING"" ""LIGHT"" to end the long night since we know most of the battle scenes are going to be dark. You could also say it could ""BRING"" the Lord of ""LIGHT"" when forged and he will save humanity.

- Now this works for Jamie too if he uses Widowswail combined with oaktheeper to kill Cersie. The key is in the wording ""WIDOW"" which is what Cersie is, and ""WAIL"" which is what she will do when the sword is plunged into her and ""OATHKEEPER"" because the oath to protect the stark girls is fully accomplished when Cersie is killed and Jamies story will go into full on redemption for himself. This will create ""LIGHTBRINGER"" because it was forged into the heart of someone he loved for the ultimate sacrifice. He will then be the one to kill the NK. 





It could be either one of them but im convinced you have to forge these two swords back together to make Lightbringer.

[SPOILERS]-Favorite GoT Moments,"I was getting ready for work this morning and just pondering what we are in for as a result of the 55 day and night shoot that the production of Season 8 just wrapped.  This took me back to Hardhome, which still contains one of the coolest moments of the show for me: Jon Snow shouting ""Nights Watch!  With me!"" and rushing back into the fray.  The combination of how steadfast Jon is in his resolve and the creeping undertones of the show's theme song intermixed with the battle music is top notch for me.  

What's your favorite GoT moment?  Can be either from the show or books, but I'd love to hear some of what the rest of you all look forward to on re-watches/rereads.  ",gameofthrones,True,1523373429,2018-04-10
"[SPOILERS] Bran only told his sisters half of the story, and he's keeping the rest to himself.","One of the open questions going into Season 8 is how Jaime will be received if/when he arrives at Winterfell, given that he was the one to push Bran from the tower and paralyze him. However, I think Bran's already made a decision - he's going to keep this information to himself so long as Jaime helps their cause. The issue will probably come up, but in the context of Jaime apologizing to Bran without prompting or Bran confronting Jaime privately.

Given that Bran's 3ER knowledge appears to encompass every event in history (at least on the show, if not in the books), it's safe to assume he knows who shoved him and why. It's also safe to assume that his injuries have come up in conversation with his sisters, since the Starks appeared to have planned for Bran's testimony about the assassin and the dagger during Littlefinger's trial.

They charged Littlefinger with, among other things, instigating the conflict between the Starks and Lannisters by having Lysa falsely accuse the Lannisters of poisoning Jon Arryn and falsely claiming the dagger that Catelyn brought to King's Landing belonged to Tyrion. The Stark-Lannister conflict escalated to open hostility and violence as a result of Catelyn taking Tyrion prisoner. 

Bran left out a big part of that story. Catelyn was easily convinced that Tyrion hired someone to kill her son because she was *already* convinced that the Lannisters had tried and failed to kill Bran by throwing him off of the tower. And that, of course, was Jaime's fault. This wasn't solely the result of the letter about Jon Arryn - Catelyn grew suspicious after finding a long blonde hair inside the tower.  Catelyn knew better than take a Lannister prisoner based solely on Littlefinger's word. Littlefinger identifying the knife as Tyrion's only served to confirm her existing belief that the Lannisters tried to murder Bran.

If Jaime hadn't shoved Bran (an act which was clearly unplanned and not connected to Littlefinger's scheming), Littlefinger wouldn't have had the opportunity to orchestrate Bran's attempted murder and frame the Lannisters. Had this not happened, there would only have been the letter to generate conflict. Catelyn gave some credence to Lysa's claims, but she definitely wasn't inclined to throw caution to the wind and take someone prisoner based only on that message. Ned was also clearly not inclined to confront the Lannisters without additional evidence. Lysa didn't have the best reputation in terms of sanity or stability, so anything she wrote had to be taken with a grain of salt.

Jaime shoving Bran also helped Ned connect the dots about Cersei and Jaime's affair and the illegitimacy of Cersei's children, since the most logical explanation was that Bran witnessed something he shouldn't have when he climbed the tower. And of course, learning the truth about Robert's so-called heirs was what motivated Ned to conspire against Cersei and Joffrey when Robert died.

Everything Bran said about Littlefinger was correct, but it was only half of the truth. Sansa, Arya, and the rest of the North don't seem to know that, which means one of the following happened:

* **Bran denied having any memory of his fall from the tower.** I think Sansa or Arya would be skeptical of this, given that he can see every other thing that ever happened. Arya might suspect he was hiding something in order to prevent her from seeking revenge.


* **Bran told them Jaime did it but somehow persuaded Sansa and Arya not to react to this information.** Weeks after Bran arrived at Winterfell, Sansa encouraged Brienne to go to King's Landing by assuring her that Jaime, who treated her honorably before, would be present. Maybe she'd have strategically withheld this information from Brienne so Brienne wouldn't derail the truce by confronting Jaime, but I don't think Sansa would have gone out of her way to compliment him if she knew. I *really* doubt anyone could convince Arya to ignore what Jaime did for the sake of diplomacy. She'd have been furious that she had an opportunity to kill him while he was at the Twins but didn't take it. Arya would have tried to get word to Jon before the armistice negotiations or told Brienne before she left for KL or raged at Sansa for not immediately putting a bounty on Jaime's head or done *something* to express her anger.


* **Bran's fall never came up, so he never had reason to mention it.** Also seems unlikely, since they appear to have discussed the origins of the Stark-Lannister conflict with Bran before Littlefinger's trial.


* **Bran claimed his fall was accidental.** This would weaken any claim Bran made later about Jaime shoving him and call into question any future claims Bran makes based on his visions. If he's portraying the fall as an accident now, he'll continue doing so. Right now, everyone seems inclined to trust Bran's visions. If he intends to convince people that R + L = J, he needs to maintain his credibility. The book Sam found only accounted for Lyanna's marriage, not her pregnancy or the identity of her child.


Deciding whether or not to disclose Jaime's actions wasn't critical to convicting Littlefinger, but there's been no indication whatsoever that Bran has shared this information outside the trial either. 

It wouldn't have tipped off Littlefinger to reveal this information while they conspired against him, either. If anything, it might have helped the Starks. The belief that Bran was injured by a Lannister is the entire reason Littlefinger was able to frame Tyrion for the attempted murder. Confirming Jaime's involvement could have reassured Littlefinger that the Starks still trusted his version of events - that Tyrion hired an assassin to finish the job for his siblings.

Bran must also know that Jaime is en route to Winterfell as of the season finale. If his intention to punish Jaime, he's not going to wait until Jaime is at their gate to share this information with Sansa. He'd warn her, so she can prepare for his arrival. Jaime is still a deadly fighter, and it makes no sense to charge him with attempted murder without a plan in place to contain him. Bran may be able to see Jaime's intentions now, but he can't predict with certainty how Jaime will react when cornered.

We won't know for sure until next season, but I think Bran's already made up his mind. He hasn't necessarily forgiven Jaime (maybe he's keeping the secret so he can threaten to tell the entire North who crippled him if Jaime betrays them for Cersei), but he's not going to drop the bomb immediately, either.

EDIT: It's also interesting that, during the trial, the Starks explicitly attributed the entire Stark-Lannister conflict to Littlefinger's scheming, with all the Northern lords as witnesses to this claim. It's possible that Bran deliberately pushed a narrative favorable to the Lannisters when sharing his visions, laying the groundwork for cooperation with both Tyrion (who abandoned House Lannister and would be slightly more palatable to the North as a result) *and* Jaime (who never cast aside his association with the Lannister family - only with Cersei). Rather than ""the Lannisters are the enemy and Tyrion is the exception,"" the attitude of House Stark is shifting toward ""the Lannisters are our allies and Cersei is the exception.""",gameofthrones,True,1523375531,2018-04-10

[Spoilers] How Jon will forge Lightbringer,"I think it’s inevitable for Jon to be Azhor Ahai. Even if there’s other candidates, for the sake of the argument I’m going to assume that it’s going to be Jon.

The way you forge the sword is by first quenching it in water, then the heart of a lion, then the heart of your loved one.

Jon already quenches the sword in water when he went north of the wall and fell in that lake. He is still missing a lion and his loved one.

The lion will be Tyrion. Remember the ominous tones of the ending of this season. We’re not sure why Tyrion what Tyrion spoke about with Cersei, but it prompted him to look at Jon and Danny’s sexy time with a sort of dread. I believe this will eventually cause Jon to kill Tyrion due to Tyrion betraying Danny. 

It sounds far fetched, but let’s see the other options, Jaime and Cersei. Cersei does by Jaime’s hand, obviously. I don’t see why Jon would possibly kill Jaime after that. Nor do i see Jon killing Cersei. 

Lastly, Jon kills Danny when she’s killed and turned into a white.

[Spoilers] Mummer's Ford Intrigue,"This is about the series of moves made in the opening stage of the Wot5K and the political considerations of various parties at play here. The situations stands like this: Catelyn has taken Tyrion prisoner and gone to Vale. Tywin calls his banner and prepares to go to war with the Riverlands in retaliation. Edmure calls his banner to defend his lands. 

What's interesting in this series of events is that Tywin seems uncharacteristically stupid in his actions, while we get a rare glimpse of Ned actually being a good politician. For these reasons, I believe these events deserve a lot more focus than they are given. 


**Tywin's Response:** First, let's take a look at Tywin's decision to go to war with Riverlands. No doubt, whoever told Tywin also told him of the charges Cat levied against Tyrion. At this point, Tywin is completely ignorant of the Lannister conspiracy at KL - he doesn't know that his children are screwing each-other or that his grandkids are products of incest or that any of them had a hand in Arryn's death. But he doesn't care. All he cares about is that someone arresting a Lannister makes his house look weak and he cannot have that. 

What's interesting here is that a peaceful resolution would've actually been of much greater benefit to Tywin. Westerlands and Riverlands aren't independent kingdoms whose only option is to go to war over something like this - they have the Iron Throne as the superior authority they answer to. And Tywin wields a lot of political clout with the throne - given that it owes him a large debt and the Lannisters have infiltrated all parts of the government. Tywin could've appealed to the King for justice here and used his clout to get his way. Played right, he could've gotten Ned fired as Hand for abusing his authority and forced Robert to name himself as Hand. Even if Tyrion ends up dying in captivity, it still works out in Tywin's favor - his hated son is dead, but he showed everyone who's the boss by getting his enemies banished from the court. 

But Tywin's pride wouldn't allow this. He wouldn't go begging the king for justice like some common peasant. No - the slight to House Lannister has to be answered by House Lannister. This kind of thing is common with Tywin - he often let's his pride and ego get the better of him. 


**Plausible Deniability:** To his credit, Tywin is not completely blind to the consequences of his actions. By starting a war, he would be breaking the King's Peace and he'd risk bringing the wrath of Iron Throne down on his head. Which is why he wants to goad the Tully's into breaking the Peace first. By sending Clegane to raid and pillage in Riverlands as an incognito brigand Tywin accomplishes 3 objectives: first, he bleeds Riverlands of their strenght, second, he undermines the commoners' confidence in their nobility by showing them that they cannot protect their own and third, if the Riverlords retaliate, Tywin could claim that they were the ones who started the hostilities and he was the one defending himself. 

As cunning as this decision sounds, there is a glaring oversight here. Tywin sent his most recognizable lackey to do the job and there is no reason for him to expect that the Riverlords would act the way he wants them to. He under-estimated Hoster Tully, who instead chose to petition the king instead of simply retaliating. He sent a delegation to KL to identify Clegane as the perpetrator and Tywin as the mastermind and to ask express permission to retaliate in kind. 

This one move risks turning the tables on Tywin. Now he'd be the one branded criminal and traitor. Which is what makes this oversight surprising. Did he think that the Riverlords would never consider getting permission from the king? Did he think that Robert would simply dismiss their accusations? Or that Cersei would prevail on him to stay out of it? The kind of risk he is taking here doesn't befit his image as a cautious and pragmatic man. 


**The Trap:** Later on, Tywin indicates that he was laying a trap for Ned. That if he managed to take him hostage, they could've exchanged Ned for Tyrion and settled the whole thing. The fact that there was a trap waiting for Beric Dondarrion proves he wasn't just making stuff up. Ofcourse, Jaime attacking Ned in KL screwed up this plan. But even so, this plan seems particularly stupid for a guy like him. 

The only way this plan works is if Ned blunders into this trap as ""Ned Stark - Catelyn's husband and relative of Tullys"" and not as ""Ned Stark - Hand of the King and Executor of King's Justice"". The chances of former being the case is close to zero. 

Let's look at this from the Iron Throne's perspective - 2 of Robert's Lords Paramount are going at war with each-other. Robert might be willing to smooth over a kidnapping and hush up a street brawl, but this kind of political upheavel cannot be ignored. To allow this to happen, would show that Robert is too weak to control his bannermen and any considerations of weak kings being the bane of kingdoms aside, Robert's own ego will not allow it. He is obligated to intervene here and shut it down as firmly and decisively as possible. 

So when the petition reaches the court, King's Men are going to ride out to resolve this mess. And most likely, Robert himself would lead the charge. Let's not forget that Robert hates his kingly duties, but he does enjoy making war. Chances are that he'd leave Ned behind to rule while he deals with his mess personally. And if Tywin attacks Robert, he has just made an enemy of every other kingdom - none of whom particularly like him. 

But let's say Ned is the one sent here - in which case, he'd go as Robert's representative. He is the Hand of the King and an attack on him would mean that Tywin has just defied the Iron Throne. In this scenario, Robert would have to marshal his forces and crush Tywin decisively just to save himself from political embarrassment. 

Let's see the expected reactions from other Houses here: Once Robert brings in the Baratheons into the mix, the Tullys and Starks would naturally join up with them. Lysa might keep the Arryns out, but that's something no one would expect. The Tyrells would see their opportunity to get rid of Cersei and put Margaery in Robert's bed - so they'll jum in as well. The Martells have been waiting for their shot. And the Greyjoys would pounce the moment they sense vulnerability. 

With this foreseeable outcome, I cannot imagine what Tywin was thinking here. Did he really think that Robert was too gutless to actually intervene? Or did he think that Ned would be too stupid and honorable to ask Robert's permission before riding out to defend his wife's family? There is underestimating your enemies and then there is completely misreading the political situation and this seems more like the latter. 


**Ned's Response - the Good and the Bad:** To his credit, Ned has a solid grasp of the situation and the players here. He completely sees through Tywin's intentions and figures out Hoster Tully's hand in it. And his response shows that Ned is NOT the honor-bound idiot everyone seems to think he is. 

Rather than keeping this a war between the Houses Stark/Tully and Lannister, he makes it about keeping the King's Peace and chooses to mobilize the Crown's forces against Tywin Lannister. This is probably the first time he uses the power of the office to commit the Crown in supporting the Tullys. 

But it wasn't an unqualified success. There are a couple of odd things about Ned's decision. First one being him sending a portion of his own men with Beric and thus further weakening his position in the capital. 

What's more odd is that he sends only 120 men to deal with this. Here there were conflicting reports of how many outlaws there were - some said 50, others over a 100 and some suggested hundreds and hundreds. What is clear to Ned, however, is that Tywin is behind it and he has a lot more men than just a 100. 

So why send such a small force here? I think Ned might've been giving Tywin an out in order to avoid a full-blown war. A small force like this indicates that they are only there for Clegane and if Tywin acknowledges Clegane went rogue, the issue can be settled here and now. But if Tywin doesn't and attacks them, then Ned has the just cause to bring the entire might of the Iron Throne on Tywin's head. 

But if Ned was thinking that far ahead, why didn't he send Loras with them? Doing so would've made sure that Highgarden would be involved in the ensuing conflict and they'd be firmly on Baratheon side. If Loras gets killed at Mummer's Ford, there goes any chance of a Lannister-Tyrell alliance. The contradiction between sending so few men and not sending Loras doesn't make sense to me. 


**Stroke of Luck:** Given the setup here, one cannot but see how lucky the Lannisters got with Robert dying when he did. And make no mistake, it was pure luck. 

When Robert went hunting, it was for a White Hart that had been sighted in Kingswood. No matter how drunk Cersei got him, hunting a stag wasn't going to get him killed. Fortunately for the Lannisters, that stag got killed by wolves before Robert could get to it - so he turned his attention to a monstrous boar deeper in the forest. 

Forget about all he political moves being made here - if Robert gets home having killed the stag, he hears of Tywin attacking men under *his* banner in Riverlands and then he has no choice but to start a full campaign of subjugation against him. 


**TL;DR** This is a discussion about Tywin's opening attack on Riverlands using Clegane as proxy and how shortsighted and risky it actually was. In contrast, Ned shows off some of his political chops by completely outmaneuvering Tywin and placing him in a bind, even though he could've done an even better job of it. It was sheer luck that this misguided action didn't cause the fall of House Lannister.

[Spoilers] Historian's Fallacy,"Fans of the series love criticizing or crediting the characters for their failures and successes and there is a lot of judgment and discussion going around regarding which characters are smart/stupid, astute/naive, pragmatic/honorable and so on. But in my experience a lot of these judgments rely on the benefit of hindsight bias. A lot of fans argue that these decisions/events/actions were smart or stupid and consequential or flukes based on how they affect the narrative. 


This is a big mistake, in my book. If we take destiny for granted and assume that things happened because that was the only way they could happen, then none of the characters can be criticized for their actions. Criticizing or praising these characters for their choices relies on the assumption that their choices mattered - that they were capable of choosing differently and if they had, the outcome would've been different. 


Now this is where Historian's Fallacy comes in. The historian's fallacy is an informal fallacy that occurs when one assumes that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and having the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision. For fans analyzing the series, it manifests itself in 3 ways:

1. Where events happening beyond the characters knowledge affect how their choices play out. Whether these are events happening in secret or whether they are happening far away doesn't matter - they are often used as evidence regarding how wrong or right a character was in making certain decisions. For example, Ned trusting Littlefinger. 

2. Where the subsequent events are regarded as direct, necessary and foreseeable consequence of certain actions. These consequences, especially if unfavorable, are used as evidence of exactly why the action that led to them was a mistake. For example, assuming that Catelyn was responsible for the war because she arrested Tyrion. On the flipside, fans also credit other characters with unwarranted foresight if events end up happening in their favor. For example, crediting Littlefinger for Tyrion's arrest, as if he knew all along that it'd happen. 

3. Using different values and perspectives to judge a character's competency in context - this one is also known as presentism. For example, crediting Tywin for the ""master-stroke"" of the Red Wedding. 


I think the worth and ability of characters should be judged based on what they know (as compared to what they should know), how the react and how well they can foresee the consequences of their actions. Consequences that happen due to forces or events outside a character's control or knowledge is not something they deserve to be blamed or praised for. 


What are the examples of judgments based on hindsight bias that irk you the most? Where you consider criticism or credit is unwarranted? Conversely, what the examples that others would consider good or bad based on hindsight - but you consider to be good or bad regardless of consequences? That is, you that the character did make the right (or wrong) choice based on the information they had and the foreseeable consequences, but an argument from consequences is unnecessary? 


Edit: I'll share some of mine:

Judgments that rely on hindsight:

- Blaming Catelyn for the war because she arrested Tyrion. At the time, she had every reason to trust LF and Lysa, Ned was still Hand and Tywin had options other than starting a war. It was a risk, but a calculated one - not an action of a stupid, impulsive woman.

- Crediting Cersei for the ""right"" moment of Robert's death - Her plans were so poorly thought out that its a miracle they succeeded at all.

- Judging Ned as naive and stupid for losing the game - Ned was actually quite astute in whom to trust and he had every reason to trust Littlefinger at the moment. Even so, his trust was measured. People forget that Cersei's victory here was a very close-run thing - meaning Ned wasn't as out of his depth as people presume.

- Blaming the Red Wedding entirely on Robb's ""stupidity"" - This judgment over-estimates how consequential Robb's ""mistakes"" were and what role events outside his control played in it. Even Word-of-Martin disagrees with the level of blame put on Robb here.

There are other examples here, but I hope to address them in the discussion below. ",gameofthrones,True,1521894311,2018-03-24

[SPOILERS] Why Cersei will kill the Night King and redeem herself,"To start, I need to take us back to season 4 episode 2. The Purple Wedding.

[SPOILERS] Was Tywin really so bad to Tyrion?,"Before you downvote me into oblivion hear me out.

Yes, Tywin despised the fact that Tyrion was a dwarf and drank &amp; whored his money away but he also saw potential in his youngest son. Unlike Jaime, the arrogant warrior, and unlike Cersei, the conceited queen, Tyrion was--like Tywin--pragmatic and could be ruthless at times. However, let's not forget that Tywin arranged the marriage of Sansa to Tyrion which was a smart political move on his part and gave Tyrion higher status.

With the rest of the Starks presumably dead, Sansa was no doubt the Lady of Winterfell and Tyrion was, through his marriage, the Lord of Winterfell. Once Sansa gave birth to a son Tywin could've easily revoked Roose Bolton's claim as Warden of the North and installed her son as Warden with Tyrion acting in his place till he came of age. Now, let's be honest, the Northern Lords would've probably despised Tyrion at first due to his last name but if they got to drinking with him I think they would've at least found some common ground with him.

If Tyrion had succeeded in securing peace in the North and ensuring a Lannister-Stark rule I think Tywin would've named Tyrion as heir to Casterly Rock since Jaime would've stayed in the King's Guard and Cersei would've still been forced to marry Loras (since the Sparrows would've never taken power). 

Tywin may have acted cruel to his youngest son, but arranging Tyrion's marriage to Sansa Stark proves that he at least wanted one of him to succeed where Jaime had failed. But, of course, thanks to Littlefinger and Olenna that all went down the drain.

EDIT: Just fyi, I am not at all saying Tywin was a kind and caring father who was good to him his entire life. All I'm saying is that he saw potential in Tyrion and used it.",gameofthrones,True,1521912900,2018-03-24

"[SPOILERS] Sam Tarly, the dumb highborn lad that ended the war with a swing of his sword.","So re-watching the series I came across the scene where Robert talks about his first kill at Summerhall during the rebellion. A Tarly boy thought he could end the war by killing Robert after his horse had taken an arrow. 

“Mine was some Tarly boy at the battle of Summerhall,” Robert says. “My horse took an arrow, so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword.”

Robert of course crushed him but that made me start thinking of scenes involving Sam because unlike the Tarly boy in Roberts story, Sam is no dumb high-born.

When we first meet Sam, he is shown as a coward. His whole life he's been a coward. His father disowned him because he was ashamed of him not living up to the family name. Fast forward to Sam taking his fathers sword and then forward again to when Sam is in old town talking to Gilly right before they leave:

""Are you sure you want to do this? You've always wanted to be a maester."" In which Sam replies, ""I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men"".

I propose that all these scenes are foreshadowing Sam dealing the final blow to the Night King, finally being the man his father wanted him to be. He will do this wielding Heartsbane.

If you want to take this theory a step further. The Nissa Nissa is Gilly and Heartsbane turns into Lightbringer through the prophecy. Yes, it's a Sam Azor Ahai Theory.

Has anyone proposed this theory before? What do you guys think?",gameofthrones,True,1521959858,2018-03-25

[SPOILERS] Which episode has the best title?,"With the Game of Thrones television series I am always quite amused by its choice of episode titles. 

This amusement is due to the multiple meanings that episode title has to different subplots which happen within that episode.

For example the episode ‘Kissed By Fire’ refers to Jon Snows subplot with Ygritte. It also ties into Beric Dondarrion and The Hounds story within the same episode. 

What other episodes throughout the series have this great use of titles?

What would be the best way to end the final episode of Game of Thrones? (scene or shot) Should it be something similar to Harry Potter where it shows so many years into the future?

A group of people gathered around a dinner table or fire and talking? A scene/shot of hope or despair? A scene/shot that gives closure? A scene/shot that is a total surprise? A scene/shot that causes controversy? The aftermath of a final battle? A death? A birth? Anything else?

[SPOILERS] Theory~ The White Walkers and the Children of the Forest,"I don’t know if this theory has been posted before, I literally just thought of this, so please bear with me. 

In the Histories and Lore, it was mentioned that the Children of the Forest warred with the first men. The first men had bronze and they had numbers and they were superior in warfare. They were completely destroying the CoF in warfare. The Children used all the magic they could, but they still couldn’t defeat the Men. In a Hail Mary move, they used dark magic to turn the numbers of the first men against them. This, I’m assuming, is the army of the dead. The more their people die, the more enemies they have to fight in the battle field. 
I’m assuming the CoF didn’t create the White Walkers because it’s said that the FM and the CoF joined forces against a common enemy (this was also shown in the series on Dragonstone in the cave) and drove them back into the deep North and Bran the builder built the Wall. 
If the White Walkers were a branch of the CoF, possibly corrupted by black magic or maybe the Children who actually cast the spell to make the Army of the Dead and it backfired on them, then that would explain a few things. It would explain how the Night King can raise the dead. He simply uses the magic of the Children, most likely because he had it. It was impossible for the first men to copy the magic of the Children (and the magic man has is different from that if the Children) is its more likely that the NK actually has this magic with him. 
It also gives him a motive beyond “must destroy” and “reasons”. He is pissed that his people were kicked out of their homeland and he’s come back to destroy the occupiers and take his home back. 
If you look at the CoF and the WWs then they’re faces even look sort of similar. 

Please, let me know what you think. 😊

Edit: Maybe my theory needs to work out a few kinks, but I don’t just believe the WWs were created to just destroy. There must be some motive. ",gameofthrones,True,1521977998,2018-03-25
[Spoilers] Lannister Passivity,"For a family that is supposedly very ambitious and power-hungry, the Lannisters do very little with the opportunities they are given. Despite all the intrigue and conspiracy they are involved in, they seem quite content to let things unfold instead of being proactive in seizing the opportunities. 


Consider the Freys, for example. Old Walder gets a new wife everytime one dies even though he has more Freys than he knows what to do with. He is also constantly approaching different lords for marriages and wardships. Or consider the Tyrells - the moment they get a foothold in the Royal court, they start putting their men in the Small Council, including trying to get one of their Maesters to replace Pycelle, they get Loras into Kingsguard and they try to immediately steal Sansa. 


Compared to them, the Lannisters practically did nothing while they were this close to the Throne. 

- Cersei is screwing Jaime and all her kids are bastards, but she is really careless when it comes to hiding it. Both Varys and LF know, sure, but even Stannis starts catching on and its hinted that Renly might've known as well. 

- Even though she knows that both Jon Arryn and Ned are investigating, she never makes a move to deal with them. She got incredibly lucky that LF happened to have reasons to get rid of them himself. 

- Even though Pycelle is already a Lannister spy and stooge, she never gives him any instructions or directions. When Jon was poisoned, Pycelle decided on his own to withhold care expecting that this is what Cersei would've wanted - but she never told him to do so. The idiot also never tried to distract Ned from his investigation - another thing Cersei could've done to buy time. 

- When Robert decides to name Ned Hand, Cersei response is to pin her hopes on Ned refusing - which is why she doesn't press the issue. That seems pretty stupidly passive - to hope that someone refuses status or honor and then it happens to fall into your lap.

- The Lannister response to Bran's coma? Hope that he'd die or even if he wakes up and tells everyone, just pretend he is making stuff up. 

- There is no indication that Cersei ever tried to cultivate LF as an ally before he came to her offering her the goldcloaks. Not only did she not run away when Ned gave her the chance, she didn't even try to take action against him. 

- Her attempts to kill Robert were similarly half-assed. Goad him into a fight hoping someone lands a killing blow? Get him drunk on the hunt hoping he gets into an ""accident""? 

But Cersei isn't the only one here:

- Tywin keeps talking about not wanting Tyrion as his heir, but he never does anything to disinherit him. He doesn't send him to become a maester or a septon - even though there were talks of these possibilities. 

- He never remarries in an attempt to create another marriage alliance or get a new heir for himself. 

- Clearly he wants Jaime to inherit - but he never makes any attempt to get him out of the Kingsguard. Post Robert's Rebellion could've been the perfect opportunity - say that Jaime did the right thing, but admit that some token punishment was in order for breaking his oaths. So how about being dismissed from the KG? Sure, it'd dishonor Jaime, but we know that Tywin isn't above getting a bit of mud on his cloak. 

- He never tried to infiltrate the Small Council like the Tyrells did. Couldn't he have atleast tried to get Kevan appointed as the Master of Coin? 

- A lot of his political actions - reinstating Pycelle, marrying Tyrion to Sansa, naming Tyrion Master of Coin - happen to be reactions to the encroaching Tyrell power. 

- He missed the opportunity in the North presented by the Wildling attack, saying ""Let the North bleed"". His inaction here gave Stannis the chance to act and regain the momentum for his bid for the crown. 

Edit: Missed one for Tywin:

- He never tried groom a successor to ensure the continuation of the Lannister legacy after his death. This is a world where men die of natural causes in their fifties and Tywin was much older. Even Robb understood the necessity of not leaving chaos in the wake of your death. For Tywin, Jaime was unavailable and uninterested, Cersei was inadequate and he really, really hated Tyrion. Had he died of natural causes, it was likely that Tyrion and Cersei might've fought over the Rock (witha few cousins in the mix) and that infighting might've destroyed his legacy anyway. 


Even Tyrion isn't exempt here:

- Tyrion was in court for a while before Jon Arryn died. What was he doing there? Why was his sent there? Surely Tywin didn't send him to sit around? ""A tool for every task and a task for every tool"" - isn't that what Tywin said?

- Whoring and drinking - 2 of the things Tyrion had in common with Robert. They could've become close friends by bonding over this - but it doesn't seem like Tyrion made any attempts to make inroads with the king. 

- Given his intelligence, Tyrion could've sought a beurocratic position in the court long before things went to crap - so why didn't he?

- Tyrion knew all along that Littlefinger was behind the lie that got him arrested and started the war. And yet, he never even tried to deal with him. Nor did he tell his family about it - as evidence of why they shouldn't trust Littlefinger either. 


I'm sure you can find excuses for individual example, but taken together this constitutes a pattern of behavior which is hard to explain. So why were Lannisters so passive? Did they just think that things would turn out in their favor simply because they were Lannisters?",gameofthrones,True,1521979431,2018-03-25

"[SPOILERS] Whenever Edmure Tully appears in a scene, I can't stop seeing him as Brutus from his role in Rome","It's different with King Beyond the Wall, Mance Rayder. He does well not looking, talking and acting like he did as Julius Ceasar in Rome. Edmure Tully though...just can't see him as anything other then Brutus. Ironically their both pretty incompetant as well. I.E. Edmure attacking a mill and failing at his job to lure the mountain. 

 Julius Caesar(Considered by the masses ""The man of the people"" for all his reforms. For instance, addding many new members of the senate to better represent the interest of the masses then just the privileged.) Brutus thought killing Gauis was for the good of the people, killing the ""tyrant"" and saving the republic, like his great great ancestor had killed the last king of Rome, the treasonous senators thought if Brutus dealt the killing blow, the people would love him. Instead, he ironically was the one that brought upon the downfall of the republic. The events that happened later as a result of the assassination transformed Rome into an empire and the rest is history. I often wonder if not for Brutus, mankind might have put it's first man on the moon 1000+ years ago.

I guess it's both a bad cast and good cast at the same time. But I prefer not to see an actor as someone else from a different story. I wish the actor that played Mark Antony was cast in some role rather then the actor of Brutus :(",gameofthrones,True,1522029995,2018-03-25

[Spoilers] It would be interesting if.....,"Cersie was the one to die in child birth instead of Danny and Tyrion would raise her child (A dwaf) and live out the rest of his days at Casterly Rock with Sansa.


- This would basically be redemption for Tyrion because he ""feels bad about the children"" and he loved his nieces and Nephews, plus he still shows some emotion for Cersie. 

- If would be interesting if the baby ended up being a dwarf after all of the talk for years of Cersie hating Tyrion for being a little monster, and killing their mother in childbirth. Now shes faced with the same fate. It is incest afterall and has a chance to be a dwarf even though her other kids turned out normal.

- I feel like Tyrion is going to end up with Sansa. Her endgame will be she got what she wanted in being a ruler, but she didn't get her handsome young prince. She is obviously more humble and has grown up a lot with all she has been though so I think at this point she could find happiness with Tyrion. 

- Cerise told Tyrion over and over the give Sansa a child, and it will make her happy, he was adamant that he would not sleep with her.  Well the ironly is they will be raising Cersies child instead of their own.

[SPOILERS] Most “Evil” Character - Discussion,"With GoT being on a long break, and most of us probably rewatching the show to get our fill, I decided to answer a frequently asked question: 

Who is the most “evil” character on GoT?

Before I start, this is likely going to be a lengthy post.

And before I get into the characters, I am going to define “evil”. An evil action is an action that is meant to harm, torture, manipulate, or even kill another person. Essentially, an evil action is an action that is intended to cause someone else misery or harm. Therefore an evil person is someone who wishes to do bad, and cause others harm, or anything that will impact them in a negative way. 

A couple other differences that I am going to clear up:

There are very few pure evil characters in GoT, many characters are evil. To be considered pure evil (by me at least), a character must have NO redeeming qualities whatsoever.

Pure evil characters therefore are: Euron, Ramsay, Gregor

Evil characters include: Joffrey, Cersei, Littlefinger... etc.

And the last thing before I get into the characters:

Psychopaths/Sociopaths.

The way I (and most leading experts in the field) differentiate them is that a psychopath is a person born without a conscience, or the ability to truly emotionally connect with anyone. They are cold blooded, essentially predators. They also have reduced fear, and are easily bored. Psychopaths can not empathize with others, or feel remorse for their actions. 

Sociopathy, on the other hand, stems from bad environment, neglect, or abuse. These people can still empathize, but to a much small degree than most people. They also have a conscience, but as mentioned, it is to a MUCH smaller degree.

Now, to get into the actual characters:

I think it fair to say that the characters who are obviously in this debate are:

Ramsay, Euron, Joffrey, Roose, Gregor, Littlefinger, Cersei, Night King. 

Now, I am going to claim that Joffrey, Cersei, Night King are absolutely not the most evil, despite the fact that they have all committed horrible crimes, they all have, even if they are very minor, redeeming qualities. 

Cersei loved her children, Joffrey loved Margaery, and was a bit of a coward, Night King we don’t know enough about, and may even be a character we know. 

In my opinion, the 3 most evil characters are, Euron, Ramsay and Gregor.

Roose was more of a sociopath, someone who was willing to do anything to survive, and would betray anyone on a dime. Kind of... maybe... cared for his son/sons...? 

Littlefinger was similar to Roose, an incredible manipulator, albeit a coward in the face of real danger. Definitely a sociopath, and not even the worst. 

Gregor, despite having no real intelligence to speak of, is a psychopath who didn’t hesitate to burn his own brothers face, for the smallest inconvenience. He also frequently rapes, and murders people. However, it is worth noting that he does work for Cersei, but this is after being brought back, and I’m still iffy on whether or not he’s being mind controlled/just working for money... etc. Regardless, he’s still a horrible person. 

Ramsay is a sexually sadistic psychopath who takes great pleasure in physically, or mentally harming others. Ramsay is without question the most sadistic human to ever set foot in Westeros. 

Euron is a sadistic (not sexually sadistic) psychopath, and a malignant narcissist (an extreme force of narcissism often coupled with sadism). Euron rapes and murders his own family, and is an incredible manipulator. Euron is likely the most psychopathic person to set foot in Westeros. 

Euron and Ramsay are undoubtably the two most evil characters in the show, and possibly in the history of TV. However, I believe that Euron is likely the worse of the two, despite not showing us as much as Ramsay has. 

Euron isn’t a sexual sadist, so not every scene with him is going to be torture porn and him skinning people alive. However, this doesn’t mean that Euron won’t torture/rape someone, he just won’t get off while doing it. Euron is incredibly callous with his torture, and will even torture his own family without batting an eye. Euron tortures his own men, family and more, and enjoys it, but is also callous towards others suffering. Euron is also an incredible manipulator who can change his personality on a dime. But his true personality is likely the darkest one in Westeros’ history. 

Ramsay, despite being horrible, is a one trick pony. Yes he tortures people in the worst ways imaginable, but so does Euron, and unlike Ramsay, Euron will also do other things that are just as horrific, if not worse, and even revels in murdering his own kin.

So in my opinion, the top 5 most evil characters in GoT go:

Euron, Ramsay, Gregor, Cersei, Roose. 

That’s just my thoughts, any feedback is appreciated, feel free to let me know who you think the worst is. I can’t wait to see how the show ends, and I’m definitely interested to see what they do with Euron. I hope they didn’t introduce him too late, Pilou Asbæk is rocking it as Euron!

[Spoilers] Regarding Great Councils...,"Are the Great Councils intended to be legislative committees that are supposed to inform the decisions of future issues or are they more like Kingsmoot - more of a popularity contest that applies only to the current issue at hand? 

Here's the statement by Archmaester Gyldayn that bugs me to no end:

&gt;In the eyes of many, the Great Council of 101 AC thereby established an iron precedent on matters of succession: regardless of seniority, the Iron Throne of Westeros could not pass to a woman, nor through a woman to her male descendents.

The first problem here is that qualifier ""In the eyes of many"". If Jaehaerys had called the Great Council with the intention of it being a legislative assembly weighing in on the matter of succession law, why wouldn't that already be clear to everyone? ""In the eyes of many"" implies that whether or not the Council set a binding precedent is a matter of opinion or perspective. People don't go around saying ""In the eyes of many, Andal law says sons before daughters"" - because what Andal law says is a matter of fact, not interpretation.

The second problem is gender wasn't really raised as an issue during the Great Council of 101. All claims were regarded as valid and it was deemed that Viserys' claim, which had the advantage of *proximity* was better than Laenor Velaryon's claim, which relied on *primogeniture*. The implication being that Laenor was a close second and if Viserys hadn't existed or been a woman or been a great-grandson instead of a grandson, Laenor would've won out. 

The question of whether the throne can or cannot pass to a woman or through a woman was never raised - it was simply determined that proximity is better than primogeniture. 


These two things taken together seem to imply that when the council was called, it was never intended to set a binding precedent. Instead, it was about solving the issue at hand. And then the sexist society of Westeros retconned the Council's decision as legally binding when they thought it was in their interest. 

I tried looking at other Great Councils to see if they made judgments that could be regarded as binding. The second set of Great Councils was about electing regents for Aegon III. These regents served their terms and were dismissed later - but this didn't set the binding precedent that any regent had to be chosen by a Great Council. Queens and Hands could still serve as regents when required without needing to call one. 


The third Great Council weighed in on succession again - but once again, here they did not discuss a matter of law or succession, but they tried to figure out who was the most suitable candidate for a king. They chose Aegon, for lack of any better candidate, but whatever precedent it might've set was never invoked. 


Based on this, my view would be that Great Councils are called to deal with current crises but that is where their authority stops. That using the decision made in one to justify future actions would be a self-serving retcon. 


On the other hand, it would make sense for a king like Jaehaerys to think ahead and settle the matter such that not only is the current crisis averted, but any future similar crises are dealt with as well. It would make sense for him to call the council to settle the matter once and for all so that future generations don't have to keep calling one everytime a problem comes up. 

Also, in a society without a written constitution or a legal code, law is often a matter of perspective. In cases where there isn't an explicit statement by the king or by whatever religious code they follow, if enough people consider something as the law, then it is to be regarded as such. 

If we take this view, then yes, you can justify the Great Council setting a binding precedent. 


I'm not sure which way to lean here. First I thought that option 1 seemed logical and later I leaned towards option 2 - but now I'm conflicted once again. 

Is there any information or perspective I've missing here that would resolve it?

"[SPOILERS] So, I need a clarification on the power balance between Joffrey, Cersei, and Ned","This is something that has always confused me. I think I understand, but I wanted to get the opinions of others!

The way that I understand it, if Robert had died but hadn't named Ned Lord Regent, then Cersei would have become the Queen Regent by default. It also seems like the Regent is the one that's supposed to rule and have the power, because the actual King (Joffrey) is considered too young to effectively rule the Seven Kingdoms. If that's the case, why does Joffrey still have any power? I get that he's technically the King, but isn't the whole point of appointing a Regent to strip him of power so that he doesn't make any stupid decisions because he's young? 

And then you introduce Ned becoming the Lord Regent, which means (again, this is just my understanding. I could be wrong) that Cersei is no longer the Queen Regent. This was also before she was on the Small Council if I remember right, so why did she still have any power at all? I understand that power resides where men believe it to reside, but if we're talking on a technical level, how does this all work out? ",gameofthrones,True,1522253777,2018-03-28

The Hound:

Arya Stark:
 You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.




- Arya is obviously talking about Yoren or Jaquen here, but I almost think they secretly wrote ""He'd kill you with his LITTLE FINGER"" referencing Lord Belish AKA: Little Finger. Just a sneaky way of letting us know by the choice of words ""little finger"".
Why else say that. Like I said Arya is not talking about LF but the writers want us to know who the real evil is by using the wording.

- After all he is one of the most evil characters in the show. Even though he hasn't physically killed many, his schemes and motives have gotten many people killed without him being detected. That's a real killer hiding in plain sight. 



- Kind of like the quote a fan noticed in the book about the hound saying ""Bloody Wedding"" referencing the Red Wedding. The hound didn't mean it that way but on re-read you can interpret it like a sneaky shadowing. Just a nice little creative tid bits the writers include to make you think. 

It's hard to explain but you get what I mean.

Now, Night King also took the pain of raising the above people from their death to fulfill what he has forseen(He has a dead army and cleary has the power to raise the dead). Beric, Melisandre and other red priests clearly would have mistaken this as some spiritual magic and on many occasions they metion that no body knows what the Lord of light wants. He just wants to get his things done.

So, if this is true, Night King is the song of Ice and Fire and everyone was dancing to his tune and when the Night King dies, Jon snow dies as well.

This could be a foreshadowing. In Season 7 Episode 6 of the TV show at the battle of the frozen lake:

Beric points his sword towards the Night King and says that there is one another way to end this mess. * Jon : You don't understand. * Beric : The lord brought you back and he brought me back. No one else just us. Did he do it to watch us freeze to death? * Hound: Careful Beric, You lost your priest. This is your last life. * Beric: I've been waiting for the end for a long time. May be the lord brought me here to find it. * Hound: Every lord I've ever met has been a cunt. Don't see why the lord of light should be any different. The camera pans and zooms towards the Night King.

I can see it working two ways and both don't seem likely...

A - you are going to write 8 novels. You get to novel 7 and you have a character do something like ""hold the door"" and then you think... damn, it would be cool if back in books 3,4,5 he always said something that sounded like ""hold the door"" - hodore... Well, I don't see how it could work this way because it seems like when the author is writing books 3,4,5 he didn't know himself what was going to happen in book 7 ?!?!

B - you create this elaborate storyboard that connects all the characters together / major things they do / when they die / who they kill / etc and then you use that storyboard to flesh out each novel as you write it. Doing it this way would ensure that you are laying groundwork in books 3,4,5 for something that finally gets revealed in book 7.

Season 8 Viserion,,gameofthrones,True,1522374207,2018-03-29
[SPOILERS] How i think its all gonna end and why.,"This is just my theory on how I think various ends will be tied in game of thrones. This is in no particular order and I have read the books, so my theory is based on my knowledge from the books and the show, but I am ONLY talking about my theory for the SHOWS ending.
Alright, let's jump into it.
First, Jamie Lannister will die. Before I get into how and why, here are some side notes; 
In the books and the show, Cersei was given a prophecy by a witch of sorts. She is said to have only three children, all of which will die, and also she will be killed by “a little sibling”. Because of the translation of valyrian, it could be interpreted in many ways, but in Cerseis interpretation, the witch meant one of her little brothers. Part of Cerseis hatred and fear for Tyrion has to do with this, because she is convinced the witch was talking about her brother when in fact, I and many others believe it to be Jamie, who is technically younger than Cersei. 
Another side note is the prophecy Danny saw in the house of the undying. In her vision, she saw the Iron Throne room destroyed and covered in snow. When she walks up to it, she reaches out for it, but does not take it. 
Finally, it is said many times in the books and the show that Jamie and Cersei were born in the world together, and they will die together. They other firmly believe this to be true.
Ok. Notes are done. Here is how I think his tale will end; I believe Jamie will join and fight with Danny, and when everything is all but lost, he will go to Cersei and beg her to surrender and as for pardons. He will go to her and learn that just like the Mad King, Cersei plans on blowing up all of Kings Landing with the cashes of wildfire below the city. This goes along with a lot of foreshadowing in the books, which describes Cersies anger/eyes being like wildfire. Jamie will be enraged, and he will kill her by strangling her to fill the prophecy, but he will be too late; the order was already given, and the he and everyone in kings landing explodes in green flames, fulfilling the idea that they will leave the world together as well as the vision of the snowy and destroyed throne in Danny's vision.
Next, is who will sit the Iron Throne. Again, Danny's vision shows her reaching for it, but she never takes or evern touches it. I think that she will never sit the Iron Throne. She will learn from King Roberts failure that conquerors make poor kings/queens, and as a result she will instead stand aside and return to Dragon Stone after pledging her aligence to whom ever she chooses to sit the Iron Throne.
I also believe Arya will die. I don't really know how, but her story give her no place to rule, unless, and this is very possible, she is chosen to become Warden of the north. 
The only way I see this happening is if Tyrion sits the Iron Throne and sees his marriage with Sansa legitimized with her consent. I don't really think that whole senario will play out though. I think Sansa will remain Warden of the North.
Tyrion will sit the Iron Throne because of course he will. The books and the show talk so much about how great a mind he has, and it only makes sense he sits it IMO. Again, that's just my personal theory. I also hold to the theory that he is Targaryen, but I don't want to get all into that (if you really wanna know just look it up a lot of people believe this or at least agree it's possible).
So what about Jon? I think he will go back to the wall at the end to rebuild it and see that men never again forget the white walkers. Lame? Yes. “What?!? He won't live happily ever after with Danny?” you might ask? No, is my answer. I think the romance will die with the discovery of his true Father, and when everything is said and done, his Honor will come first as it always has. 
Bran will go back North to the tree, leaving Sansa or Arya as Wardens of the North if they live to see the end.
Idk about Brienne of tarth. She might die in the explosion, or she might die somewhere else...or she might live and continue to serve as the first female in the King's Guard. Who knows. Her story in the books has a totally different path haha.",gameofthrones,True,1522374269,2018-03-29

[SPOILERS] Why hasn't there been widespread condemnation of Cersei's action?,"According to Tyrion, Jaime Lannister finally decided to kill Aerys Targaryen during the Sack of King's Landing because he found out that Aerys had stashed a massive amount of wildfire underneath the Sept. So despite years of madness and cruelty, this singular plot was enough to convince Jaime to stab Aerys in the back to prevent the death of civilians. I'd imagine that was also the reason why Robert Baratheon kept Jaime in the Kingsguard.

In S06E10, Cersei Lannister ordered for the wildfire to be ignited, and thus, killed thousands (?) of innocents. One could argue that Jamie's love for her prevented him from speaking out, but what about everyone else? It seems that no one has said anything about the mass murder, and Cersei's infamy remained at a similar level. 

In fact, in season 7, Daenerys and Jon Snow were even willing to enter into negotiations with Cersei for a truce. Even Randyll Tarly, who spoke about not being oathbreakers and backstabbers, didn't mention this when pledging fealty to Cersei and House Lannister.

[Spoilers] Robb's Command Error,"In A Clash of Kings, Edmure blocking Tywin's path on the Red Fork is regarded as his big blunder that changed the balance of power in Westeros. It allowed Tywin to save KL from Stannis and solidify the Lannister-Tyrell alliance, while at the same time screwing up Robb's plan to lure Tywin back West. There has been a lot of debate on who is the blame here - whether it was a command failure and Robb should've told Edmure his plan or if Edmure exceeded his orders for glory. 

I've seen a lot of back and forth on this, but surprisingly, I haven't seen anyone bring this particular point up - **Robb couldn't have known what his plan was going to be when he left Riverlands. Which means, there wasn't *anything* he could've told Edmure.**


**Strategic Picture**

Here's the strategic picture of the war from Tywin and Tyrion's pov. He is situated pretty centrally at Harrenhal from where he can come to the defense of KL quickly if if its put under siege. Robb can't attack KL with Tywin to his rear. He can't attack Harrenhal because its too strong of a fortress. He can't attack the Westerlands because they are well-defended by the mountain passes of Golden Tooth and Deep Den and they are raising a new army as well. As far as the Lannisters are concerned, Robb has no option but to wait while he grows weaker everyday. The Lannisters are currently engaged in chevauchee against the Riverlands - their raiding and pillaging at feeds their army at the cost of Riverlords and also undermines trust in their new king, who apparently cannot protect his own people. So they expect that Robb's troops will start getting demoralized and start deserting. So they think they can win the war with minimal effort.

There are two gaps in their strategic visions - if Renly or Stannis besiege KL, they'll have to respond and that might allow Robb the chance to attack their rear. And a more subtle one - the Westerlands are not nearly as secure as they believe. 


So here's the strategic picture from Robb's perspective. He knows everything the Lannisters know and how they want it to play out. He also understands the gaps in their vision and the possibility of using the Lannister chevauchee tactics against them. So he makes plans - reaching out to Renly to hurry up and attack KL and reaching out to Balon to attack the Westerlands. But he can't sit back and hope for these alliances to work out - he still has to act. And his plan is to go West *through the Golden Tooth*.


**Objective when he leaves:** 

There is no way Robb could've planned to lure Tywin back west - there were too many variables and too many ways for it all to go wrong to set that plan in stone. And given that it'd have been hard to communicate with Edmure on the field, he has to give his uncle the freedom to respond appropriately without having to check with him first. Edmure isn't some upjumped newbie - he is to be the Lord Paramount of Riverlands and thus expected to act while keeping an eye on the big picture. There are cases where he'd expect Edmure to do exactly as he did.

Robb didn't know about the hidden pass around the Golden Tooth until he got there. His original plan was to force his way through and he was riding with 6000 cavalry hoping to use their speed and mobility to his advantage. So what are the things that could've gone differently and how Robb would expect Edmure to respond?

Let's say Robb has to force his way through Golden Tooth - but the defenses prove too strong. If Tywin gets the news that Robb is fighting at Golden Tooth, he might try to march from Harrenhal and try to take Robb in the rear. In this case, Edmure is absolutely expected to stand in Tywin's way and stop him from crossing the Red Fork. 

Let's way Robb does make it through Golden Tooth, but they were able to send out warning to Stefford Lannister who gets his army of 10,000 ready in time. There is a decent chance Robb might lose this fight - so he'd need a clear path of retreat to Riverrun. One that Edmure would be expected to keep secure - so once again, keep standing in Tywin's way. 

Let's say Robb still manages to beat Stefford Lannister - but he doesn't have enough men to make a stand against Tywin. He can go ahead with his raiding and pillaging plan, but now, Edmure is expected to bleed Tywin as he marches west and then prepare to attack his rear. 

Let's say Tywin chooses to swing south and use the Gold Road instead of crossing the Red Fork and using the River Road, Edmure would be expected to bleed him as much as possible while crossing the Riverlands and at the same time, secure a path of retreat for Robb along the Gold Road. 

Let's say before Robb can attack Stefford's army, Renly speeds up and attacks KL. Or maybe Stannis hires a few sellswords to make up for the lack of men and attacks KL. Either of these would force Tywin to march. If the timing matches up Edmure would be expected to attack Tywin in the rear while he is facing Stannis/Renly. If it doesn't, he is expected to stay put. 

Let's say Balon responds to Robb's offer and their combined forces manage to take Casterly Rock. In this case, Edmure would be expected to stand aside while Tywin marches and then consider the possibility of trapping him between Robb's forces and his own. 


There are too many variables and possibilities here - all of which would require Edmure to react differently. But one thing remains constant - **Edmure must not lose Riverrun**. Robb can't educate Edmure on what to do in each and every scenario - he has to trust him to make the right call as the situation demands and only leave him with the instructions about what is absolutely necessary. 


**So why blame Edmure?**

The defense based on lack of future knowledge that applies to Robb, also applies to Edmure. Figuring out that Robb would have a plan to deal with Tywin would've been hard enough. He couldn't have predicted that Stannis would attack KL right at this moment or that the combined Lannister-Tyrell forces would manage to defeat him.

From Edmure's perspective, he was doing something strategically and tactically smart. He feels that his job here is to guard Robb's rear and make sure that Robb's 6000 cavalry is not attacked by Tywin's ~20,000 men unexpectedly. So Edmure thinks that by standing in Tywin's path, he is doing what Robb would've wanted him to. 


But here's where he bungles up - **The strategic objective of the entire war is to get the Lannisters out of Riverlands**. The Lannisters have been raiding and pillaging the Riverlands for a while now - stealing and burning their food, killing their peasants. Now they are finally trying to leave and you fight to keep them there? So that they can raid and pillage some more? Why on Planetos would you think that that was a good idea?


Sure, bleed them as they pass you by and once they are gone, start preparing an exit route for Robb or reinforcements as need be. But for Seven's sake, let them go. Your lands have already suffered enough.

I believe at least one or two of them (for the sake of an example Robett Glover and Lord Ryswell) could betray Jon, maybe choose to leave the North entirely or maybe if Euron and the GC surprising attacking WF theory i have is true then maybe they could make a deal secretly with Euron or Cerseo via Raven that they would help Euron sack WF and bring to her one of the stark sisters as a hostage. Either way we know that the Northerners lords will have a problem with Jon bending the knee, and it would be interesting if one or two of them betrayed or at least attempted to betray Jon.",gameofthrones,True,1522452652,2018-03-30

[SPOILERS] Theory regarding Cersei in S8,"In Season 5, Episode 1, it starts off with a prologue scene of Cersei and her friend, Melara Hetherspoon running in the woods somewhere within the Westerlands. They come across a woods witch, Maggy, where Cersei demands the witch to give her information on whether or not she will be queen. Cersei's third question is if she and the King will have children. Maggy's response is that the King would have 20 but Cersei would only have 3, who will all die before she does.

From this, you can deduce that Cersei will die sometime within Season 8, considering she is currently pregnant with a 4th child, whether or not it be from Daenerys, or Jon, after they, presumably, defeat the Night King, or if the Night King will make it to King's Landing and there is a final defense for the side of the living, or if she will die in some other way.

The possibilities are endless on how the great show runners will decide to end her, but it is definitely going to happen within the season.

[SPOILERS] Who sent the Catspaw assassin to kill Bran?,,gameofthrones,True,1522492406,2018-03-31
[SPOILERS] Who sent the Catspaw assassin?,"Had it not been for this murder attempt and Littlefinger's lie about the identity of the owner of the Valyrian Dagger (which Baelish had really lost to Robert and not Tyrion), the conflict between Starks &amp; Lannisters may have been harder to spark.
___
In the books, Jaime says it was Joffrey that gave the order, maybe ""to impress Robert"", he had thought. And GRRM has confirmed that Joffrey hired the assassin to kill Bran: *""After overhearing Robert's claim that men could end the suffering of a horse with a broken leg or a dog that has gone blind, but that they are too weak to end the suffering of a crippled child, Joffrey steals a Valyrian dagger from his father and hires a servant to kill Bran.""*
___
But Joffrey could not have accomplished this on his own. Simply because he had left Winterfell two weeks prior to the attempt. And you can't trust a random assassin to stay behind and manage it all.
___
Like the Order of the Green Hand stated (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z22hStz-oLs), if the Catspaw had been paid in full two weeks before the murder, he would have ran away with the valuable dagger &amp; the gold right after Joffrey had left Winterfell. Why would he risk his life trying to kill the son of the mightiest Lord in the North when he had already been paid?
___
This means there must have been someone else helping Joffrey in this scheme. Someone that was still in Winterfell when the events took place. 
___
___
On the other hand, if the real intention was to get rid of Bran, why hire a middle-aged local that even struggled against the unarmed Catelyn? A man that looked more like a random farmer wanting to make an extra buck than anything resembling a skilled assassin, fit to kill a Lord.
___
And when he entered Bran's chambers and ran into Catelyn, the assassin said: *""You weren't supposed to be here. No one was supposed to be here""*. 

But everybody in Winterfell knew Catelyn had not left Bran's side in weeks. So this means the assassin had been fed some fresh information, from an insider that had ensured him he would not encounter anybody on his way. A source reliable enough for the Catspaw to be surprised when the intel. proved wrong and he saw Catelyn in that room.
___
The assassin had been deceived. It looks like that someone else Joffrey appointed to oversee the job never intended on killing Bran, but had planned to frame the Lannisters for attempted murder.
___
___
Which raises the question: who was that other person that wanted to turn the Wolves vs the Lions? Who would a middle-aged assassin from the North trust to know when Bran would be vulnerable and alone? Who could have discretely started a fire in Winterfell, while assuring the Catspaw he wouldn't meet anyone by Bran's side?
___
Once you take away the Starks and Theon from the equation, there is only one strong candidate left, the traitorous Maester Luwin. 
___
He was one of the few an outsider would believe to hold accurate information regarding Bran's status. He would have been the one advising Joffrey killing Bran was indeed mercy. And he would have known exactly who to suggest for the job. 
___
Like Martin hinted when he was asked: *""Did Littlefinger influence Joffrey to try and kill Bran?""*; he said: *""Well, Littlefinger did have a certain hidden influence over Joff...but he was not at Winterfell. And that needs to be remembered.""*  

Maester Luwin was the only person in Winterfell that would have been able to sent information to King's Landing and plot framing the Lannisters with Littlefinger (Master of Ravens is a key position for a spy). 
___
And if you pay close attention to this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFLo7gef6Gs&amp;t=65s (1:05 - 1:50), this series of events could have happened:

- Luwin went into Bran's chambers to talk to Catelyn;
- Right after he left, he told the Cat's paw *""The way is clear. No one is by Bran's side""*;
- He then started a fire shortly after leaving Rob and Cat; 
- At which point the assassin went in the room as he had been advised.
- However, to make sure the man would not kill Bran, he immediately sent Summer after him to protect Catelyn. 

Isn't the timing curiously suspicious? 

___
Why would he have done it? For the same reason Maester Luwin had previously plotted to send Jon Snow to the Wall. Because he is one of the corrupted Maesters, working hand to hand with Littlefinger to turn Starks vs. Lannisters and plunge the 7 Kingdoms into Chaos.
___
___

Potentially could generate a lot of revenue for HBO given that a lot of ticket sales would come from people who would likely otherwise be using a friend's HBO account or pirating the show. Obviously would still have to distribute the episodes through the normal methods too, but personally I would choose big screen over small for ending this series.

[Spoilers] Night King questions...,"Apologies for spelling/grammar, a few beers in. 

Can anyone explain what we know so far about the Night King? To me, it seems like 

• Humans fought the children of the Forest

• The children captured and stabbed a human with an icicle, expecting him to all of a sudden be a weapon for them against his old kind. 

• Night King now kills everyone and can raise them from the dead and have all these ice powers. 

• Night King has intelligence, proven by creating plans and giving (telepathic?) orders, which he’s used to gain numbers in troops and dragons.

1. Why did the CotF give this dude massive powers, and expect him to suddenly be on their side?

2. How does his magic surpass anything his creators can do, and allows him to create an army only limited by the population of his landmass? 

3. How were the other White Walkers created? He was stabbed by ice, but the others apparently are just touched, going by Craster’s son. Does the ice baby grow up? Do Walkers then age? They’re so much better than wights, why doesn’t the NK try and create as many as possible so they can be foot soldiers instead of generals/elites?",gameofthrones,True,1521006275,2018-03-14

[Spoilers] Robb's Karstark Decision: Another Perspective,"Robb Stark's decision to execute Ricard Karstark for the murder of 2 Lannister prisoners is commonly held up as one of his 3 great political blunders (the other 2 being breaking the marriage pact and sending Theon to Pyke). Its commonly accepted in the fandom that he should've chosen political expediency over his idea of honor and justice. However, I'd like to argue here that because of how Karstark acted, Robb never had any other option. Rickard Karstark's state of mind and his actions are something the fandom usually glosses over as actions of a grief-mad father. But without taking those into account, any judgment about the politically expedient option would be incomplete. 


Now, the first thing to know about Rickard is that *any* peace with the Lannisters was unacceptable to him. In the books, this is made clear when Robb is announcing his peace terms to be sent to KL - terms that heavily favor the North and that everyone knows the Lannisters would never accept - and Karstark walks out in anger. A war of vengeance is an empty and futile endeavor that would only spread misery - and this is something Robb is smart enough to understand. Which is why he sets up reasonable strategic objectives that his bannermen can accept. For Robb, war had always been a means to an end with the end being a return to some sort of peaceful co-existence with the Lannisters with his family safe and his kingdom secure. But because of the death of his sons, Karstark no longer saw any value in peace anymore - he wanted more bloodshed, he wanted as many Lannisters dead as possible to satisfy his own thirst for vengeance and he didn't care how many of his countrymen had to die to make that happen. 


Karstark was in a nihilistic suicide spiral since the beginning. Ofcourse, initially, his loyalty was strong enough to stop him from doing anything drastic, but come season/book 3, peace between North and the Iron Throne was starting to look like a real possibility. At that point, Robb was vastly outnumbered and it didn't look like he'd win or get justice for Ned. Which means, since he is a good king, he might choose not to keep sacrificing his men and try negotiating instead. And since Robb had proven himself quite formidable in the battlefield, the Lannisters might consider negotiating to be a cheaper way out. Especially if Jaime is returned and they don't lose any face by doing so. This was unacceptable to Karstark and he was determined to make it as hard as possible - if not impossible. He wanted to make sure that they'd fight to the bitter end. 


Which is why his actions were carefully planned. Once again, the books made it clear here that the Karstark had started their desertion *before* Rickard murdered those boys. Before Robb passed his judgment. And Karstark gave them a strong motivation not to come back - he announced that he'd marry his daughter to any man who brings him Jaime's head. 


Consider the implications of this: Jaime is a valuable hostage and would necessarily be a part of any final peace deal. By commanding his men to kill him on sight (as opposed to recapture), he is not only making sure that Catelyn's plan fails, but also that there is no final peace deal between Robb and Tywin. And since his men have deserted with dreams of marrying a highborn lady filling their minds, holding Karstark hostage isn't going to bring them back. 


Karstark made sure that any politically expedient option wouldn't work out. His men are not going to come back just because he is held hostage. If they kill Jaime and if the Lannisters kill the Stark girls, it scotches any possibility of peace. And since his men knew what he was planning, Robb couldn't cover up the death of the squires either. 


Even beyond that, he wanted to do as much spiteful damage as possible on his way out. That's shown by his half-hearted defense of his actions - ""it was vengeance"" (wrong targets), ""your mother is a traitor too"" (doesn't justify your treason), ""they were our enemies"" (you need to obey the king to call his enemies your own), ""you'll be a kinslayer"" (kinslaying doesn't apply to distant relations), ""the king means to scold me"" (if you want mercy, try not to insult the guy you want it from). He didn't care about defending himself because he didn't care about living. It was one elaborate suicide-by-Robb. 


At this point, Robb had no other option other than executing him. Holding him hostage wouldn't have brought his men back and even if Robb had sent him to the Wall, he'd have continued inciting his men. A cover-up was not an option. And if Robb had any hope of protecting Sansa from retaliation, he had to send a clear message to the Lannisters that this act was unsactioned and the perpetrator has been appropriately punished. And since Karstark remained defiant without an ounce of contrition, Robb had to send the message to his other bannermen as well that disobedience will not be tolerated. Any leniency here would show Robb to be weak and then he wouldn't be a king anymore. 



Make no mistake - ultimately, Robb made this choice because of his concept of honor and justice. That is what convinced him that this was right and necessary. But its also true that he never had another choice. Atleast, none that would've made any difference for the better. ",gameofthrones,True,1521017450,2018-03-14
[Spoilers] Jaime's Regrets?,"Much has been made of Jaime's redemption arc and fans generally seem of the opinion that it is one of the best in all of fiction (not so much for the show, though). However, I still hold to the belief that no redemption arc can be complete without the character expressing genuine remorse for his actions. 


Its well and good for Jaime to decide that he'd do better and act more honorably in the future - but that resolution rings hollow if he fails to understand exactly why he fell short the first time around. Its not about looking for explanations or excuses for his actions, its about accepting the moral responsibility for them. Its about having a ""What have I done?"" moment where you realize that this choice you made was fundamentally wrong. 


Right now, I've been re-reading some of Jaime's chapters and they seem rather scant on remorse. I definitely saw remorse for his failure to protect Rhaegar's children - how he seemed haunted by Rhaegar's ghost. And there was remorse about letting the Kingsguard fall so low. But not for much else. 


With regards to his relationship with Cersei, he seems more focused on her betrayal and what she has become instead of his own culpability in it. There is more a sense of ""How could I have ever loved this woman?"" or ""How could I not see what she was?"" - but Jaime needs to acknowledge that even if Cersei had been a pillar of fidelity (to him), sleeping with the Queen and fathering bastards was still very, very wrong, because it put the entire realm at risk. Similarly, his regrets about pushing Bran from the window seem to be more about how it messed things up and how Cersei was unhappy with him for it - but no regrets about crippling a 7 year old. 



Are there any parts that I'm missing? Parts where Jaime reflects on his action with remorse? Parts like him watching the devastation of Riverlands and thinking ""I did this. Its all my fault""? ",gameofthrones,True,1521020836,2018-03-14

The great Lords would witness Daenerys Targaryen calling for a truce to deal with the real threat to the people. Great PR for team Targaryen plus it makes it harder for Cersei to say no or say yes then betray them. Either way the Lords would rather fight for a Queen who fights for them. 

This little addition would also make Tyrion's grab a Wight plan more believable as the stakes would be even higher - if the plan works they can get the whole country behind them.

"[Spoilers] A potential hidden truth behind incest, babies, and Human Sacrifice","It's kind of alluded that the only reason the NK spared Craster was because he sacrificed his Sons to him. So what if.... In order to make a WW, there has to be human sacrifice.


With a whole show based around sacrifices this makes so much sense that a WW can only be made this way. To go even further I believe that not only does it have to be from sacrifice but possibly only be though incest. Hear me out here guys....




-Craster's sons are from incest.



-Cersies baby will be from incest.



-Jon and Danny (if they have one) 
will be from incest. 




Maybe incest is key somehow and that's what the Knight King is after. Other than the historical aspects there has to be some deeper meaning behind all of the incest between important characters. There has to be some meaning behind Cercies pregnancy. 





Maybe if this is true of the Night King and Crasters sacrifices, Cersie could potentially sacrifice her unborn child to him in exchange for her life and somehow that's how she becomes the Night Queen. Even if not the Night Queen, since she made the sacrifice he cant kill her so she will have the biggest alliance of all. If not the story line with Cersie maybe Jon has to make the decision to sacrifice his baby in order to save everyone.


 


Cersies love for her children has been driven into us since day one for a purpose. This could be the final act to show she has truly lost it. It was also driven into us how Jon was so torn by the fact Craster was sacrificing his baby boys. It would be quite the Irony if Jon was faced with the same decisions. Either way I think we can all agree All of these babies, incest, and human sacrifice will play a huge role in the end game.

[SPOILERS] The third and final reveal theory,"There's three big reveals to be revealed throughout Game of Thrones as set out by GRRM. We have already learnt the first two, the first one was Shireen being executed and the second one was Hodor being hold the door.

I have a theory which has been conjured up in discussion with my colleague at work, in which we believe we know the third and final big reveal.

To set the scene, it involves Sam and Gilly, who we sometimes wonder what their significance to the whole storey is. So, let me add some key story lines to Sam and Gilly (particularly Sam).

Sam is an outcast, sent to the wall by his Father because he lacks the skills of a warrior and doesn't fit in with his Fathers expectations of a Son, he doesn't want him to hold his name or inherit his land and castle etc. This fits in with GRRM affection for cripples and bastards.

Sam has played a key role in the battle against the WW from the beginning, he found the stash of dragon glass on the fist of the first men, he killed the first WW with the dragon glass, he was also left alone/ignored/unnoticed by the WW (when he hid behind the rock). He discovered that Dragonstone had mines of dragon glass. This is all very important stuff, although it may not have been seen to be at the time.

Other noticeable things he has done, was to have John elected as the Lord Commander, free Gilly and baby Sam from Craster, also saving their lives on an occasion or two, assisting Bran reach beyond the wall etc. He also learnt from books how to cure greyscale and then cured Jorah, he discovered Johns parentage and then told Bran who went back and saw this.

So, you get the picture, Sam is of massive importance. Now, let's have a look how he could be involved the third and final big reveal.

We've seen Sam and Gilly read about the Azor Ahai prophecy, we know that Lightbringer is created by stabbing a sword through Nisa Nisa's heart. Our theory is that Sam, is in fact Azor Ahai, and Gilly is Nisa Nisa.

Sam will read about the steps to create lightbringer, he will tell Bran, who then tells him that he is Azor Ahai. He is then left with the task of creating lightbringer, which he must do by stabbing Gilly through the heart with his sword, none other than the one he stole from his father, ironically called heartsbane. If we think about the 'purest love' in Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue against Sam and Gilly's (John and Danny have only just met and could be described as more of a fling than love). If you take a moment to think about Sam having to kill Gilly, you can already get an idea of the emotion involved, which would be similar to Shireen and Hodor, it's also the least expected, which makes it even more plausible.

Also, what other significance does Gilly play? I would liken her character to that of Shireen and Hodor, we didn't realise what significance they played in the story until they died. I think this will be the case for Gilly as well, as right now, I see no other need for that Character.

Now that we imagine Sam has lightbringer, but he isn't a warrior, so, he simply hands lightbringer to the prince that was promised, most likely John Snow, but possibly Danny and any other possible candidates.

Sam as Azor Ahai is leading the rest into the battle against the WW and has been doing so from the beginning, he doesn't have to be the warrior we may have expected, he simply is the commander or general, directing the forces in order to defeat the WW. He is the creator of the weapon (lightbringer) that is needed in order to defeat the WW.


In my mind, it all makes sense. Let me know what you think.",gameofthrones,True,1521125614,2018-03-15
[Spoilers] The Right Meereenese Policy,"&gt;*It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.*

- Niccolo Machiavelli. 


Dany's tenure as the Queen of Meereen is usually held up as an example of misrule and how good intentions don't necessarily lead to good results. The prevailing consensus seems to be that Dany was a little too harsh and hamfisted in her attempts to reform Meereen and if she'd only been more political, more patient and more conciliatory in her approach, she might've avoided the Harpy insurgency and managed to bring peace. 


My personal opinion is the opposite. I think that Dany did fail in her Meereen project, but she failed because she wasn't harsh enough. She failed because she listened to Barristan's advice that ""these were all her subjects now"" and Jorah's advice that ""people can change"" and Tyrion's advice that ""burning cities makes you just like your father"". As the quote above indicates, Dany was trying to introduce a new order of things and for it to have any chance of success, much harsher measures may have been required. 


Putting my personal view aside, here is the bottom line for Meereen - it was a city built on slavery. Its main export were slaves. The noble families with slaves held all the political power. The families with slaves held all the wealth and lands. The slaves built the entire infrastructure - they built the roads and the pyramids and they fought in the pits. The city's economy, infrastructure, political structure, wealth distribution - they were all determined and upheld by slavery. 


For anyone to remove slavery from this equation and expect everything else to hold up would be illogical. And Dany was trying to keep the rest of the system propped up. She may have freed the slaves, but the noble families still retained their wealth and political power. Ofcourse the system was going to try to self-correct and get things back to normal. Dany was the destabilizing effect on the system and the insurgency was the system's response in trying to get rid of her. No matter what conciliatory moves she made, the Sons of Harpy would've kept doing their thing. And even within the new parameters, slavery was trying to make a come-back. It simply had a different name, like ""life-long indentured servitude"". 


I think the only way to bring immediate peace to Meereen would've been to allow slavery to take hold once again. Failing that, I don't think any politician, no matter how talented, could've made it peaceful in a small timeframe. Those looking to change, would need to change the entire system - a complete, top-to-bottom, social, political and economic reform. They could either start by annihilating the old system completely and starting from the scratch. Or they could try and do it slowly - power through the insurgency and other civil unrest, keep fending off efforts to return the system to the old status quo and keep changing things little by little until they finally start seeing the fruits about a decade later. Whichever way they choose, they are going to cause a lot of bloodshed and they are going to end up with the moniker of a ""cruel, vicious tyrant"".


But you know what - if it ends with a society free from slavery, I think it'd be worth it?


But am I missing something here? Some brilliant third option that could bring peace immediately and without a return to slavery in any shape or form? People argue that Dany did wrong in Meereen, but what was the ""right"" answer?",gameofthrones,True,1521125968,2018-03-15

[Spoilers] Hard Choices for a Ruler,"""Of all the available rulers, who would be the best to lead the war against the Whitewalkers?"" When considering this question, I often think of the following moral dilemma and how the different leaders we've seen would act on it. 


Now the Wall has fallen and the AotD is slowly making its shambling way south. Meanwhile, Winterfell stands ready for battle with sufficient grain in store, dragonglass, valyrian steel, wildfire, scorpions and whatever else is needed. But before the eventual face-off, thousands of refugees from Karstark and Umber lands arrive at Winterfell, seeking refuge. So what does the leader at Winterfell do with all of them?


These thousands of refugees may not be of much use in the war, but you are going to need them to rebuild once the war is over. The survival of as many of them as possible is what you are fighting for. If you let them all in and Winterfell falls, then everybody dies. Not to mention, right now, these are useless mouths to feed. Its entirely possible that if you let them in, your grain stores would be emptied out and you'd all die of starvation before the Night King ever gets there. In that case, the war would be lost without a sword being raised. So the rational choice for the leader would seem to be to tell them to keep moving. Keep heading south - while the rest make a stand. 


But that idea may not go over so well with the refugees. They've just been through a grueling march - they are tired and hungry and desperate and they've already seen a whole lot of their own die in the march to Winterfell. They wouldn't believe that heading south would be their best chance for survival. A march through snow without food or fire? That sounds like certain death. So if they are going to die anyway, they might as well rest a little in the shadow of Winterfell. Maybe the Lord of Winterfell will take pity on them and let them in eventually. Maybe he'll remember his duty and extend them the guest right. Maybe he'll send out some food or firewood or figure out a better way to transport them south. Whatever their hopes are, they'd believe that staying nearby is their best chance at survival - and if they die, atleast they die rested. 


Well, the leader of Winterfell can't have this either. He can't literally hand over dead soldiers to the Night King. If these people won't go on their own, he has to force them to go. Which means taking some particularly cruel and vicious measures to make them believe that marching south gives them a better chance of survival. 


And his actions would have to be really cruel to get that message across. I'm talking about making a real example here - like burning a few alive or feeding some to dragons. And these people aren't enemy soldiers or defiant lords - these are innocent civilians asking for refuge, which the leader is duty-bound to provide. The rational course of action here is almost unimaginably cruel. 


So, among your favored leaders, who would have the stomach for such an action? And since we know that Tywin, Cersei or Roose would do it without blinking an eye, let's count them out. I'd prefer to consider leaders who actually care about their subjects and understand their duty to them. And if a particular leader does engage in something like this, how would it change your opinion of them?

"[SPOILERS] Are we sure that ""Valonqar"" doesn't mean what we think it means?","I mean yes, I know that Valonqar means litteraly ""little brother"", but what if it's not what it's supposed to mean in cersei's prophecy? 
how about for example ""The valonqar"" being a kind of Nickname or even a title given to a specific person.
it's just that I find that saying ""Valonqar"" means ""little brother"" makes the prophecy way too vague and any ""little brother"" could be the one who kills cersei, in that case the writers will only have to pick anyone they want.
But Maggy said ""THE"" valonqar not ""a valonqar"" and in valyrian which makes the prophecy much more specific and pernickety and could mean that there is only one.",gameofthrones,True,1521131681,2018-03-15
"[SPOILERS] I'm constantly trying to convince people to watch the show, so I made a trailer for the whole series to use when trying to persuade someone","EDIT: I'll add the link here at the top as well for people who only want to see the video: [LINK TO TRAILER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4J7Qqn_Owk)

Note: This isn’t self-promotion. I created this for my own use and wanted to share it with more people. I even created a completely new youtube channel for this video.


We've all been there, trying to convince someone to start watching GoT. You know they'll love it, but they just won't give it a shot. And you just can’t stop nagging because you crave their reactions and want to have someone new to discuss it with. Prejudice about fantasy scares some people off. Fantasy is an F-word in movies and TV, as Peter Jackson once said (paraphrasing of course). 


I've been searching the web for a really good GoT trailer, a trailer for all seasons, (it is one long story after all and the S1 trailers don't do the show any justice in my opinion) and there are none. Only ones that show major spoilers. So, I finally took matters into my own hands and created a trailer. 


I wanted a trailer that:

* Has no major spoilers. Meaning NO dragons!

* Teases the existence of White Walkers, but keeps them a mystery. 

* Gives some insight to the main characters, since the characters are the most important part of the whole story. 

* Focuses on featuring good dialogue rather than just fighting and battles. GoT is more about political intrigue than fighting. This kind of goes along with the previous point too. 


I know a lot of people(me included) who are not impressed merely by dragons, zombies and cool action. I wanted to show that GoT is so much more than that, that it is more like The Godfather set in medieval times(at least the first seasons) with amazingly developed characters and slight, but increasing, elements of fantasy. 


About spoilers: It was very hard to make a trailer for all 7 seasons without any spoilers at all. A lot of things can technically be spoilers. Like showing Cersei with short hair means that viewers know that she’s not going to die for as long as she has long hair in the show, because they know that at some point she’s going to have short hair. I decided to let things like that slide, because people who haven’t seen it will not remember every little detail from a trailer. 


Wow, this came out way too long, so here is the link to the video:
[LINK TO TRAILER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4J7Qqn_Owk)


What do you think? Would you show this to a friend in order to convince them? Does it show too much? Of course it is always best to go into a show with as little knowledge as possible, so this trailer is more of a last resort, when you really want someone to start watching but they keep resisting.


Tl;dr - I created a trailer for GoT(all seasons) so that I (and you) can use it to to persuade friends and family into watching the show.

[SPOILERS] Valyrian steel and White Walkers,"In the battle of Hardhome (s5e8), it was shown that Jon Snow's valyrian steel sword was able to ""stop"" the weapons of the White Walkers. But, I cannot recall if it was able to kill white walkers, or if that is only able to be done with fire and steel, as Jon explained in the Dragon Pit (s7e7) to Cersei and company.

If valyrian steel can indeed kill WWs, then that seems like a pretty big miss by Jon when trying to convince Cersei and her army of way to kill the Night King's forces. So, can valyrian steel kill wights and WWs, or does it just allow someone to fight the WWs themselves?",gameofthrones,True,1521135545,2018-03-15
[Spoilers] One Thought About A Certain Thing In The Night King's Army,"So, we know arrows can't harm the dragons \(making the dragon glass arrows potentially useless\)  But I can't see how the giants will be of concern.  They will have thousands of arrow heads made in time I can only guess, and the giants said 3x \(or more\) the height of humans/wights with a massive shoulder span.  It just wouldn't be possible for them to not get hit and decimated by dragon glass arrows.  So how will they even be considered a threat at that size when dragon glass royally !@#$ up any undead it touches?  I really want to see them do some damage, but I just can't see how they would ever get close because an army would make dam sure to protect the archers for the sake of shooting those down before they approach.

[SPOILERS] My Rhaegar/Promised Prince Prophecy theory,"So I'm not sure if somebody else has already alluded to this, but here goes.

I'm almost certain that Rhaegar knew of the coming of the White Walkers. I remember reading about a book the Valeryions had that foretold the doom of men would come from a land to the west (possible prophecy speaking to the coming Night King). Another interesting point is, during his youth, Rhaegar was a zealous reader and had no interest in becoming a warrior. That is until he read something that immensely motivated him to become a warrior. I think he read some ancient text full of prophecies, which also included the prophecy of the three headed dragon (prince that was promised). Which I think is the same as the ""Lord of Light's Azor Ahai"" prophecy. At first Rhaegar believed himself to be the ""Prince that was Promised"" (interesting that he was born of salt and flame (ref tragedy at summerhall)) however he and the story disprove that. He next believes his children with Elia are the ones the prophecy predicts, but they're dead and I forget what it was, but something convinced him that his current children were not the ones the prophecy spoke of. This one might be a stretch, but I think he stopped believeing it was possible fulfill the prophecy with children born from Elia. Something about Lyana (her wildness, her fire, beauty etc..) convinced Rhaegar she would birth the children that prophecy spoke of. Another interesting note, (cont. after warning)

*******(WARNING SPOILERS FOR THE BOOKS, DOES NOT TAKE PLACE IN THE TV SHOW)****

(cont) the following takes place in the house of the undying and I straight up copy pasted it. 

""The fifth room, finally, shows a man very much alike her brother Viserys, except that he is taller and has eyes of dark indigo rather than lilac. He is speaking to a woman who is nursing a newborn babe, telling her that the child's name should be Aegon and saying that ""What better name for a king?"". The woman asks him if he will make a song for the child, and he replies that he has a song and that ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire."". He appears to look at Dany then, as if seeing her, and then he adds that ""There must be one more,"" and ""The dragon has three heads."".

So clearly they're talking about Jon (Aegon) here... but wait... did Rhaegar and Lyana have time to share such a loving moment with their new son? Is this an actual historical event? Or just an illusion to drop hints for Dany? I think it's safe to say that Dany is definitely one of the three heads, also safe to say that Jon (Aegon) is also one. Who's the third? Lots of people think it's Tyrion (as the prophecy states that no specific gender and it doesn't necessarily have to be a Targaryen). I love Tyrion to bits, but I just dont see it. Another issue, is (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT) one of the dragons is dead/undead/destroying the wall, so how can there be a third rider? WELL GUESS WHAT MOTHERFUCKER?!?! Bran Stark baby! He can skinchange, so maybe he's able to take over the undead dragon? The three eyed raven did promise him he would fly again eh ;)

So to summarize, I think Raeghar knew of the White Walkers and the only way to stop them, shacked up with Lyana, knowing it would start a war, but did so for the greater good. The prince that was promised is actually three characters, most likely Dany, Jon and Bran. Obviously I don;t think I'm %100 and can't wait for points/counterpoints to be made. Sorry if I went overboard with the spoiler warnings (new to this sub) and if I made any other mistakes please just let me know. Also written on a phone during company hours so sorry for the lack of correct grammar and maybe even basic spelling lol!

Adding this in, just thought of Lyanna Stark's last words to Ned ""Promise Me!"". Apparently she was wrought with fear when Ned initially arrived, after the inaudible dialogue and Ned making whatever promise to his sister, the fear seemed to leave Lyanna. So whatever Ned promised to her gave her a sense of relief. I'm assuming the promise had something to do with Jon Snow's (Aegon) fate, the coming of the walkers and something that Ned needed to do to guarantee the safety of Jon/fate of Westeros. After Lyanna passed, Ned remained for a while, until Howland Reed came into the room and separated Ned from Lyanna. Ned claims he doesn't remember a thing during the period of time in between her passing and when Howland arrived. This promise must of been some super heavy shit and was quite the burden for Ned to carry. I recently re watched season 1 and noticed how old and tired Ned looks, he's 36 and he looks like he's in his 50's. Obviously war will do this to a man, especially long bloody ones. But still, I think the weight of the secret, one hes never shared with anyone, has something to do with that. That's kind of where I'm at with this train of thought, I'd love to get some feedback on this.

Little tldr if you haven't heard about it, but I recommend watching the first video since I can only butcher it with my words.
The first video is very short (about 4 minutes). The main thing seems to be that littlefinger was talking to a girl in Winterfell that (supposedly) told him ""your time's up"". It goes on to say that the girl he was talking to must've been one of the faceless man and the person dying is not littlefinger but a faceless man wearing the face of him.

[Spoilers] Tyrion in S7..,"Someone asked the question of why Tyrion wouldn’t invite all the lords of Westeros to see Dany being a good queen, fighting for the people to save the kingdom. I have a theory for why they did not do this.

It would make their decision to discuss a ceasefire with Cersei seem purely political and would make it look like they were only trying to get the backing of lords of Westeros. Tyrion knows that any hint of them making a move for political gain rather than purely trying to save the realm would anger Cersei and result in disaster for team Dany, whereas by doing what they did they at least have some chance of appealing to Cersei and Jaime and gaining their support, whatever little chance it may be.",gameofthrones,True,1521144833,2018-03-15

Drogon is Lightbringer,,gameofthrones,True,1521212451,2018-03-16
[SPOILERS] Lightbringer,"The theory is an addition to the theory that Daenerys is the prince that was promised. Drogon is Lightbringer because Mirri Maaz Duur brought him to life in exchange for Khal Drogo's (as if he's Nissa Nissa). Also the prophecy says ""There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness lies heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and darkness shall flee before him."" Drogon hatched in the fire, and there is ample proof Daenerys is Azor Ahai come again, so it would make sense since Daenerys and Drogon are so close. And it is said Lightbringer radiates heat, remember Daenerys feeling Drogon's egg being warm?

And some of you might be thinking of Stannis pulling out the sword from the burning statues at the beach. But the prophecy says it is the prince that was promised who'll pull Lightbringer from the fire, and Stannis isn't   TPTWP. 

In A Storm of Swords, Maester Aemon asks Stannis to see the sword. Stannis cannot understand how a blind man can see his sword, but shows it to him. Sam describes the sword in details to Aemon: ""It glows as if it were on fire. There are no flames, but the steel is yellow and red and orange, all flashing and glimmering, like sunshine on water, but prettier. I wish you could see it, Maester"".  If you rewatch the scene when Illyrio Mopatis gifts Daenerys the dragon eggs, you'd see Drogo's egg is red at the top, then orange, then a golden yellow, as if it were on fire. 

While they are walking away, Aemon seems to be deep in thought. He asks Sam whether he felt any heat from the sword. Sam admits he saw lights, but did not feel any heat. Aemon does not reveal the purpose of his question (perhaps it is ironic that a blind man noticed what others with eyesight did not).

In A Feast for Crows, Aemon reveals to Sam what he perceived: the sword is not the real Lightbringer, since the real Lightbringer is supposed to radiate heat, and Stannis is not Azor Ahai. He claims that Melisandre has misread the signs, and Daenerys is the one whom the prophecy is about.

This led to my question above, regarding Viserion's immunity (or lack thereof) to dragonfire. We know that dragonfire is one of the few things that can kill ~~white walkers~~ wights, along with dragon glass and valyrian steel. Now that Viserion is a wight, is he susceptible to dragon fire? Or is he still immune to it as he was/is a dragon? I don't really know which way I'm gonna land on this one and was wondering your guys' thoughts.",gameofthrones,True,1521224563,2018-03-16

[SPOILERS] The House of the Undying,"Some of my favourite scenes in GOT

Dany meets Pyat

Pyat traps Dany

Dialogue as follows

*They miss their mother. They want to be with you. Do you want to be with them? You will be. When your dragons were born our magic was born again. It is strongest in their presence, and they are strongest in yours. You will be with them through winter, summer and winter again. Just a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them, and we will be with you until time comes to and end. Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.*

Its great to watch with the knowledge that Viserion destroyed The Wall - it almost gives Pyat more motive and indeed less nefarious motives than he might have previously had - although its more likely Pyat just wants to trap this source of magic for his own use

When I watched this scene for the first time Pyat came across as some sort of guardian - a bit like the Nights Watch but for magic - it all seemed a bit dramatic to trap her for all of time just to gain power in Qaarth or Essos

[SPOILERS TV &amp; BOOKS] Season 8 Jon Snow Theory,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1521286079,2018-03-17
[SPOILERS] TV / BOOKS: SEASON 8 JON SNOW THEORY,"First post here. If I've done anything wrong, please feel free to correct me. I also did a quick search in this and /asoiaf and I haven't found this theory (although I am certain I'm not the first with this idea).

Theory: Jon Snow is going to kill the Night King, then become the Night King, leading the remnants of the army of the dead back into the lands of always winter after rebuilding the wall, remaining undead for thousands of years while the children's magic rots his mind and moral fiber.

Proof (I'm not looking up direct sources, feel free to correct me as appropriate. All things written should be considered paraphrasing instead of verbatim exact words/phrasing.)

The Children of the Forest created the White Walkers to end the war with the first men. The truce was called sometime after, with men not entering the forest, not cutting down weirwood trees, and converting to their religion. Some time after that (thousands of years apparently), the Night King was defeated by the men, the Children, and 'Azor Ahai', who in turn became the Night King. It has been reported that at least one (if not both) of these leaders of the undead are Starks.

Fast forward thousands of years into the current GoT timeline, and the White Walkers are on the move south again: Benjen Stark was killed, which is not atypical of rangers north of the wall -- ""A good ranger doesn't live to get old"" -- what is atypical and unique is that the Children of The Forest brought him back. Why did the Children bring Benjen Stark back, rangers die all the time. People die all the time. Yet the Children of The Forest randomly decided to stick a dragonglass shard through some random dead guy's chest? Yes, he's needed as a plot point to save both Bran and Jon, but GRRM is not some shallow author who puts things in his story only to serve one white knight purpose. There's a reason the Children brought a Stark back, and I believe it's because the Children were intending Benjen to take the Night King's place and lead them back north. This isn't going to happen because he sacrificed his existence to save Jon's life.

So I'm going to take a leap here and say that the Night King is a Stark, and killing him won't do any good in stopping the army -- if it did, this whole situation would have been settled thousands of years ago. He must be replaced and his humanity will slowly wither over the course of thousands of years. There are only two Starks left: Bran and Jon, and Bran's a cripple. He can't kill the Night King, in addition, becoming the Three Eyed Raven might have screwed everything up (MEERA: ""Bran?"" // THE THREE-EYED RAVEN: ""I'm not, really. Not anymore."").

I believe the Northern arc of the story will end when Jon Snow sacrifices his existence and becomes the Night King. I can't see any other way that the story would remain epic and meaningful. If anyone could become the Night's King, Jorah or Beric could take on the mantle, but it just wouldn't have the same 'bittersweet' tone.",gameofthrones,True,1521286759,2018-03-17
[Spoilers] What are some of the best quotes from the GoT books and show?,,gameofthrones,True,1521288549,2018-03-17
[Spoilers] Can we talk about Daenerys and why she’s not going to win the game,"I’m sure this has been talked about before but if not IT NEEDS TO BE SAID. I love Daenerys for the head strong women she is. She is definitely an amazing character to watch and Emilia plays her character so well. Fire can not burn and dragon and she managed to bring 3 into the world. 

But I can’t help but get frustrated when she gets her and all of her followers into impossible situations. And the only way she’s able to get out of them is by pure luck, everyone else saving her, or her dragons saving the day at last minute. And then she sits on whatever thrones she’s at at the time and has that smug look on her face. It really just deteriorates the idea of this god-like character, she’s always fuckin up.

Season 1- Despite EVERYONE TELLING HER NOT TO USE BLOOD MAGIC, she does it anyway and ends up getting Khal Drogo killed, and she got the Khalasar to leave. 

Season 2- After wallowing in the Red Waste for weeks, not able to keep her people alive, she gets LUCKY and finds Qarth, where she never would have even been admitted into if it weren’t for Xaro. 
The. she manages to get her fucking dragons taken because she left them alone in a tower without her there, the most valuable things in the world.

She then goes to the House of the Undying not knowing what the fuck was gonna happen. She could have just as easily gotten herself killed and then the dragons would have been lost forever.

Season 3- i’ll give her this one because I really enjoyed the way she handled getting the Unsullied and the Second Sons

Seasons 4,5,6(?) When she gets to Meereen, she just expected to break off their chains, crucify the masters and woooo she’s queen of something without any repercussions. She then locks up her dragons (which she never even took out btw they broke out by themselves), loses Drogon and is lost again. 
When she re-opened the fighting pits and the Sons of the Harpy attacked there was literally nothing she could have done. She only lived because she flew away on Drogon and LEFT ALL OF HER PEOPLE TO DIE. Yeah Drogon kind of fucked shit up. ur she had to of known it wouldn’t be enough.

She then gets taken by the Dothraki, and again had no hope of leaving until she found Dario Naharis and Jorah. Then, she only got the Khalasar because she killed them in a fire, walked out nakey  and everyone bowed to her. 

Like, at least Jon Snow knows how to wield a sword. He led the move at Hardhome and gets out of situations because he is smart and talented. (Minus when he got stabbed in the chest by his brothers)

Everyone whispers in her ear different ideas, different ways to deal with things. Sometimes she listens and sometimes she doesn’t. And when she doesn’t she doesn’t change her mind until the last second. I don’t really see her as the superhuman anymore cause when you put everything into perspective she’s only where she is because of luck and everything else around her. Not her herself. I hate it because she’s the “Breaker of Chains, Mother of Dragons.” I want to love her but i just can’t. I left out so much too typing this now i can still think of ways she’s fucked up situations for everyone. thoughts?

[SPOILERS] Possible Season 8 Ending Theory,"Many, if not, most, of the main characters are going to die in the final season. This has recently been confirmed by the cast and showrunners. I think that by near the end (last 2 or 3 episodes) nearly everyone except the very main characters like Jon, dany, Cersei, Jaime, Tyrion, and the stark children will have died. There will be some exceptions but they are not relevant to the overall ending except Sam and the Hound. Jon’s heritage is revealed to everyone and Jon declines the iron throne. Rhaegal will have been killed and resurrected. Daenerys will also have been revealed to be pregnant.

Anyway, my theory is that at this point the white walkers will have all but destroyed Westeros and the last remnants of the army will retreat to kings landing. There they will be met with the last of Cersei’s army which they defeat.The hound will defeat the mountain and Euron will also be defeated. Jaime will speak with Cersei privately, pleading to join them one more time but she will refuse and tell him how it was a mistake to join the enemy, and blows up most of kings landing with the wildfire. This pushes Jaime over the edge and he strangles Cersei. 

Not long after, the white walkers arrive in kings landing and battle the survivors. The hound, Jaime,  and Arya are killed in the fighting. Arya actually dies in Jons arms and is one of the most tragic scenes of the series. Enraged, Jon personally battles the night king but is no match for him and is killed. Seeing the destruction the white walkers have caused, bran ignores his teachings and goes back in time to try to stop the night king from being created and instead becomes perpetually trapped within his mind, making the night king and bran together as one.

Daenerys tries to retaliate and flies in on drogon. Wight viserion is killed, but rhaegal and the night king kill drogon. Daenerys survives. Now completely outnumbered and hopeless, Tyrion makes them escape. Sansa, Tyrion, Sam, and Daenerys escape kings landing with the other survivors and flee to dragonstone, leaving Westeros to be conquered by the white walkers.

On dragonstone, Daenerys goes into labor prematurely and dies giving birth to her and Jon’s child. Tyrion and Sansa promise to lead the survivors, both southerners and northerners, to victory some day. Sam, having read through all the prophecies and stories, realizes that Daenerys was azor ahai and Jon was the prince that was promised and only together could they forge lightbringer, the sword in the darkness, who is in fact their son and will one day lead the world from the darkness and defeat the white walkers. The story ends with Sam agreeing to raise the child in hiding while documenting down the struggle of Westeros and calling it the song of ice and fire.

I believe that this ending is a possibility because the ending is supposedly going to be bittersweet and nothing could be more bittersweet than just a hope for victory. Also the last book is going to be titled “A dream of spring” and would imply just dreaming of spring arriving instead of it actually happening.",gameofthrones,True,1521322864,2018-03-17

[spoilers] Is it possible that Jaime Lannister is sterile and all or most of Cercei's children were fathered by Tyrion?,"There are quite a few things that make me think it's possible, mostly it's his constant talk about loving the kids, a few things he said during conversations throughout the show, and the fact that he had much brighter blonde hair when the show began. 

Most of all though, a sudden revelation like this seems like one of the top things I could think of that would drive Jamie to the edge and end up having him choke Cercei to death.

To those who might doubt that he'd want to, I've known people who've had sex with people they despised. He may even have done it out of love for Jamie (to save his feelings) and to stop the family from dying out.  This could even be one of the many reasons why he feels guilty throughout the show and tries to make up for it by switching sides.

Is this a common theory?  Do the books make any suggestions on this front?

Edit: Getting a ton of negative comments on here.  I want to clarify that this is just a question, not a theory. I know this is highly unlikely, I'm just interested in seeing if there's a reason (maybe in the books) why it's impossible beyond how much they hate each other.  Seems like I have my answer, but feel free to chime in if a detail has been overlooked.",gameofthrones,True,1521342443,2018-03-17

It was a great two months. Anyway I'm finally ready to jump into the full fandom of GoT now and wanted to ask the question of who's your favorite team up. I'm not sure if this has been asked before but to start I wanted to choose a rather odd couple in my opinion. I personally really liked the relationship between Arya Stark and Tywin Lannister given the circumstances. (I know Arya would have loved to kill him) but the interaction between them flushed out Tywins character a lot and sort of made me like him more.

Finally did it the day before yesterday and I am relieved to say that she loves it.

She's retired and we're chinese immigrants, so I was afraid to because of the sex (from episode 1), swearing and a little of the gore. 

Was afraid she may think I am watching violent porn. Absolutely unjustified concerns it turns out. 

Before I decided I actually searched here how it turned out for others yet didn't find anything from people introducing their parents from more conservative cultures.
Thought I'd share it in case others are reluctant too. 

Go for it, the show is a cool interest to share with your parents and they are more like you than you think. I'm super glad I did.

[SPOILERS] Why Jon/Danaerys will join with...,"So me and my friend have gathered much information to bring a new theory to the world of GOT that has connections everywhere. So let's jump into it: We believe that Jon and Dany will betray the side of the living and join the night king, we believe this from the following pieces of information (note that this theory only works because of a section from the books that is different in the show): So at the start of the books when some men of the nights watch go beyond the wall well everyone knows what happens, but its something about what happens that brings us this theory. During this part of the book when, well i guess ill say leader of the group is killed, it says that he is stabbed by 12 white walkers in unison (keep that number in your head) so that means that there are 12 white walkers, and possibly 1 more being the night king. Following this later on in the series when we get to the part where one of Craster's sons is taken into the woods, we are shown that there are 12 white walkers standing behind the night king as he goes to get the child. So now we get the 12 thing that I told you guys to remember: 12 WW's stab the member of the nights watch 12 men are killed at Daenerys's wedding jon takes 12 companions north of the wall there is a story about the 13th lord commander of the nights watch that states he took 12 men north of the wall on a mission and he later becomes the night king (not on this mission though I'm pretty sure) Now you can see just some of the links of the numbers of 12 and 13, but there is more. After me and my friend finding these connections I decided to look up if the number 12 and 13 meant anything and we found this: - ""the number 13 has a specific meaning. And this meaning is perfectly illustrated by the symbolic aspect of the Last Supper, Jesus' last meal with his 12 disciples (Judas being the 13th apostle, the one that will betray Jesus).""

So, that quote says ""Judas being the 13th apostle, the one that will betray Jesus"" So, the 13th betraying the 12

Now, Back to my connections of the numbers 12 and 13 i said: - 12 WW's stab the member of the nights watch - 12 men are killed at Daenerys's wedding - jon takes 12 companions north of the wall - there is a story about the 13th lord commander of the nights watch that states he took 12 men north of the wall on a mission and he later becomes the night king (not on this mission though I'm pretty sure)

Let's look at them backwards just because the last one ties into the second last one: 4th connection: - there is a story about the 13th lord commander of the nights watch that states he took 12 men north of the wall on a mission and he later becomes the night king So, the 13th lord commander betrays the men he took with him and the nights watch by becoming the night king. --&gt;Follows the meaning of 12/13 from the bible

3rd connection: - jon takes 12 companions north of the wall if jon follows the steps of the previous lord commander (which we think he will because of all the connections) he will betray the 12 --&gt;follows the meaning of 12/13 in the bible

2nd connection: - 12 men are killed at Daenerys's wedding Weaker point but I guess dany betrayed the 12 by letting them die --&gt;follows the meaning of 12/13 in the bible

1st connection: - 12 WW's stab the member of the nights watch weakest of all the points but I guess you could say that that 13 betrayed the 12 by not being a white walker xD

Alright, guys this theory still needs a bit of work if you guys want to do some research into what 12 and 13 could mean in this case then feel free to do so, and know this theory still has some holes so don't hate too much if you don't think it to not be possible.",gameofthrones,True,1521393257,2018-03-18

[SPOILERS] My theory of King Jaime,"If you read the title then you know that I believe that Jaime will be king in the end after he saves KL from Cersei (or Euron if Euron is the Valonqar which I think he is). Now you are probably thinking ""that's crazy and what evidence do you have for it""

Evidence:

- for starters if Jaime is the Mad King son (which I think he is) then he would have a claim

- In the original outline Jaime was suppose to take the throne for himself. But were as he got the throne in blood it he original draft, he will get it as a hero saving everyone in the final version of the story.

- Jaime hero's journey parallels Jon's. They both start out as nothing (metaphorically in Jaimes case) and come on top and a lot of people think Jon will be king but I think it will be Jaime.

- Jaime obviously has the skills and leadership to be one.

- finally it would fit with the unpredictability of GOT.",gameofthrones,True,1521396664,2018-03-18

"[SPOILERS] Samwell ""Azor Ahai"" Tarly","For years now, it's been theorized that Sam could very well be Azor Ahai. Season 7 made me hold a bit more stock in this idea...especially after he stole Heartsbane (made of Valyrian Steel). Given that we're all well versed in GoT lore, I don't need to go into detail about the whole Nissa Nissa thing and how AA will have to stab his love...blah, blah, blah.

Regardless, I always said  ""if this were to be true, there is no way that Sam would ever kill Gilly. Not even to save the realms of men."" However, I recently realized that he would stab her with Heartsbane in order to protect Little Sam in the event that she were killed and resurrected as a wight.

If this were to happen, the sword could go in as Heartsbane and come out as the flaming sword Lightbringer. I also like the idea of both Sam and Jon losing the women that they love, Gilly and Dany. Then, at some point in Season 8, the show could call back to one of their first scenes together (when they said their vows and first became members of the Night's Watch) and have them recite the words once more: ""Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.""


Those vows, recited by Sam and Jon years later, would carry a great deal of weight and be more relevant than ever...showing that they've essentially embodied what it means to ""be the shield that guards the realms of men"".

"[Spoilers] The ""Right"" of Conquest and Riverlands","The question of legitimacy is one of the most controversial and oft-debated topics among the GoT fans and in that debate, the ""Right of Conquest"" is usually one of the most misconstrued arguments brought up in the context. Its odd to see how so many fans simply accept the premise that conquest is a valid source of legitimacy within Westeros. In developing the history of Westeros, GRRM has made it quite clear on what happens when this principle is taken for granted and the Riverlands exemplify the consequences. 


First, let's start by examining what Right of Conquest means in real life. In International Law, it refers to the right of a **foreign** conqueror to claim the territories of the defeated **nation**. That is, it applies to the ownership of *territory*, not the right to the *throne*. In other words, its a method of *extending* your kingship over a greater region, but it **does not grant** you kingship. Which means, it applies when 2 sovereign nations go to war with each-other, but it doesn't apply when a vassal overthrows the king. I'm repeating myself here because this is an important distinction to keep in mind going forward. [1]


The second thing to keep in mind is the difference between a character saying ""X is king because they conquered"" and ""X is king by the right of conquest"". The first is a simple statement of fact. It implies that regardless of any legal right or justification, one can hold the throne through sheer military strength. The second statement presumes the existence of the legal principle. It presumes that conquest actually does grant legitimacy to one's kingship. [2]


Keeping these 2 points in mind, consider exactly what would happen is a ruler actually claims publicly that he he rules by right of conquest. If he establishes ""right of conquest"" as a valid legal principle within his own kingdom. He might have the military strength to keep others cowed for now, but there is no way to be certain of the future. He has just told his vassals that if any of them think they can overthrow him, they are all welcome to try. And these vassals will keep trying - frequently. Even if he somehow manages to maintain military hegemony during his lifetime, his descendants will live and die with the same sword hanging over their heads.[3]


One way for a ruler to maintain his superiority in this context would be by keeping his vassals weak and dependent. And that would be accomplished by limiting their economic and military growth. Paradoxically, this would end up creating yet another incentive for those vassals to gang up and overthrow their king. A king who limits the prospects of their prosperity is not one worth following.[4] 


Further, establishing this principle is necessarily going to create political disunity. If people believe that military might is the key to power and what was lost in a war can be regained by another one, it'd result in an endless cycle of war with every faction vying for military superiority.[5] 


**In short - if any ruler is stupid enough to establish ""right of conquest"" as a valid legal principle to determined legitimacy, then he would end up losing his throne, fracturing his kingdom and destroying his legacy.** I do not believe that any of the kings we've seen would be stupid enough to do that - not Robert, not Renly and definitely not Aegon the Conqueror. Aegon went to great lengths to legitimize his rule through other means - he wasn't a vassal of any of the pre-existing kings, which meant he was a foreign conqueror and the right of conquest would apply here. He got himself acclaimed by the existing kings (never mind that he killed those who refused). And he got himself anointed by the Faith - so his right to rule was more of a ""divine right"" than ""right of conquest"".[6] 


Having laid this out, let's turn to the Riverlands. Riverlands are an object lesson in what happens when the ""right of conquest"" is accepted as a governing legal principle. In Westeros, Riverlands is the only example of a failed state - a nation that lost its sovereignty because of political strife, failure of leadership and internal feuds. [7]


Contrary to popular belief, its not the geography of Riverlands that makes it so weak, but its internal division because at some point, they tacitly agreed to let conquest determine kingship. Every other kingdom justified its kingship by claiming descent from some heroic, semi-mythic, almost ""divine"" figure of the past - thus claiming a divinely granted dominion, instead of mere force of arms. You had Brandon the Builder for the Starks, Lann the Clever for the Lannisters, Garth Greenhand - the mythical High King for the Gardeners of Reach, Durran Godsgrief for the Durrandons of Stormlands, Artys Arryn for the Vale. Riverlands' failure in doing the same type of nation-building has been a roadblock to their growth for thousands of years. [8]


The Blackwood/Bracken feud is the oldest and most famous blood-feud in Westeros and it serves as a microcosm of ""right of conquest"" in practice. Both noble houses claim that they used to be the rightful kings and the other their vassals until they were overthrown and supplanted - and that now they are fighting to get reconquer what was lost. Multiple dynasties have risen and fallen in Riverlands - but because of the lack of internal cohesion, instead of building on the work done by their predecessors, they keep having to start from the scratch every time. [9]


House Mudd was the first we have with some degree of a complete historic record. And Riverlands were pretty united under Tristifer IV Mudd who decisively blocked the Andal invasion for a generation. But when his successor proved less than effective, the Tullys betrayed him and went over to the Andals instead. Rather than finding a ""legitimate"" successor (there had to be some younger brothers or sisters married into other houses) or rallying behind a unifying figure like Artys Arryn, the Riverlords (and Andal warlords) decided to break up into petty kingdoms and started vying for supremacy.[10]


House Justman was the next one that managed to conquer most of the Riverlands and unify it under one rule. But once the direct royal line ended, Riverlands fell into anarchy once again. [11]


House Teague gave it a shot at conquering the Riverlands, but kept facing one rebellion after another. When they decided to bring in the Faith for support, House Blackwood responded by inviting the Storm King to help them in the rebellion. And once the Storm King had won, he decided that he didn't want to hand power back to the Riverlords and annexed the entirety of Riverlands as his territory. [12]


Later, when the Hoare kings invaded, the Blackwoods (loyal to Storm Kings), tried to fight - but then the Brackens backstabbed them and helped the Hoare kings drive out the Durrandons. Except, now the Hoare kings decided that they didn't want to leave and Riverlands became a territory of Iron Islands. [13]


And ofcourse, as soon as Aegon invaded, the Riverlords sided with him in hordes to get rid of the Hoares.[14] 


**Conclusion:** The Riverlands show us what happens when people try to legitimize kingship through conquest. And a king would have to be really, really stupid to use an appeal to force as justification for his claim. A ruler has to be very careful in establishing policy and precedent and he has to keep the long-term peace and stability of the kingdom, as well as his own legacy in mind while doing so. Therefore, while military might can be used to **enforce** his rights/claims, he can never acknowledge his military to be the **source** of his right/claim.[15] ",gameofthrones,True,1521434759,2018-03-19

[Spoilers] Missed opportunity in 7x05,"Always thought it was a huge chance blown not to have Jamie (and Brown but more importantly Jamie) captured and imprisoned by Danaerys after the battle. The idea of a face to face confrontation between Jamie and Danaerys could have made for one of the best scenes in the season/show. 
Jamie facing the daughter of The Mad King, coming to terms with the act that define his life, Danaerys face to face with her fathers killer, one of the biggest drives for her vengeance for her family. It all feels like a missed chance for some of the most powerful scenes/dialogue for each of these characters. 

Not even including actual development for Tyrion having his own brother and the only real friend in his life as a prisoner. Coming to terms with slaying their father.
Tyrion and Brown reunited could be powerful.
Dany meeting Cersei using her brother as leverage would have been great.

[SPOILERS] A conclusion I always thought would be interesting to see.,"Now this prediction of events is solely based on if Jon is Azor Ahai.

Now my knowledge of the lore is limited, I haven’t read up on it in a while so someone correct me if I get some things wrong. Given the story of Azor Ahai, the man who forged light bringer had plunged the sword into water and a lions heart, both times failing to create the weapon that would save him and the people of Westeros from the long night. It wasn’t until he plunged his sword into his lovers heart that created lightbringer from this sacrifice and ultimately assisted in the win over the long night.

Now a very common theory is that Jon will be doing this himself, plunging his sword into Dany’s heart in the ultimate sacrifice to save Westeros. But I always liked to think of it going a step further. This threat to Westeros is the worst it’s seen in years. Perhaps this time around the soul of a loved one wouldn’t be enough. 

Imagine the War rages on, the people of Westeros are near the brink of extinction. Not many people are left alive, Dany has only Drogon left. They’re backed into a corner and there’s only one thing left to do. Create lightbringer, fulfill the prophecy and the prince that was promised saves the day. What’s more powerful than the soul of a person? I would assume the soul of a dragon. How cool would it be if Jon fulfilled the prophecy of Azor Ahai and created lightbringer by plunging his sword into the heart of Drogon? That would be quite the ultimate sacrifice.

Just throwing things out there, but I always thought this idea would be pretty freaking cool.",gameofthrones,True,1521470448,2018-03-19

[Spoilers] An appreciation of a show only character who hasn't received much attention.,"Maester Wolkan is an interesting character who hasn't received much love. He's interesting because he was in service to House Bolton for a very long time, at least since Ramsay's adolescence, according to their conversation over Myranda's body. He was next seen in service to King Jon and House Stark after BotB. Jon accepting him into his service as his main Maester, with the ability to read and write his messages, shows that Jon truly doesn't hold anything against other Northerners who served the Boltons. And Wolkan himself always looked terrified under Ramsay and now decently happy to be serving the Starks, he seems like a generally OK guy who was just given a shit job by his Order, but did it faithfully. I appreciate him.",gameofthrones,True,1521484523,2018-03-19

[spoilers] the third dragon,"I’m reading Dance of Dragons again, and wonder if anyone thinks they will try to weave Grif/Aegon on to the tv show?  I found a couple of threads with some theories about the third dragon. Now that we now Jon is a Targaryen and the second dragon some of those speculations are out of date. 

Aegon is obviously the third dragon in the books, but will they bring him out of nowhere in the series?  Or will they combine him with another character or just leave him out?  What do y’all think?

He has a better claim than Daenerys, but she is very popular and we all want to see her take the Iron Throne.  It seems like too important of a character to leave out, but it’s awfully late to introduce him with no foreshadowing. Do some still think Trystane or Tyrion will be the third dragon?

[NO SPOILERS] I've been teaching my dog that he gets a spoon full of peanut butter every time the theme song to GoT plays.,"He's caught on to the pattern and everytime an episode ends he perks up and waits. Then when he hears the TV static of the HBO opener he stands and starts panting. Once the music begins he is full on drooling and losing his mind, hopping around the room. We're on season 3 and I think he's gained a little weight already.

The reasoning behind this is that I want someone in my house to be as excited as I am when the new season comes out. By then he'll have been through the whole process again 2-3 times with enough of a break still that when has to wait a good 6 months to get his favorite treat and he hears the theme song start up in the other room, he'll come barreling through the house discounting anything in his path jumping around with the excitement of Arya chasing a cat.

[SPOILERS] Did Eddard ever know?,"I may have missed something, but I can't remember any mention in either the books or the show that Eddard knew about Lyanna *willfully* leaving with Rhaegar. He thought Jon was the result of rape, right?

I know he would take care of the baby no matter what because

1- He was an innocent child

2- He was Lyanna's son that she made Eddard promise to protect

But consider his point of view. Some dude abandons his wife and children, kidnaps your little sister and rapes her. His father murders your dad and brother and then asks for your head. Eddard had every reason in the world to hate Rhaegar with all his might, and then found himself forced to take care of that dude's rape-conceived baby (as far as he knew) and ruin his honor by bringing a ""bastard"" home. He was shamed for it, and his wife never forgave him for cheating on her, having a child with another woman and bringing *that same child* home to her.

Just shows to what degree Ned sacrificed himself just to protect Jon. Other men would have just said ""Lyanna's dead anyways, so screw this kid"". But Ned did not. He stained his reputation by taking care and raising his sister's rapist's child.

[Spoilers] How to reform Iron Islanders and the Dothraki?,"No matter who wins the Iron Throne, at some point, they'll have to deal with the Dothraki and the Iron Islanders. 

These two probably have the worst cultures of all - they have no concept of money or trade and all they want to do is raid, rape and pillage. As useful as it might be in a time of war, eventually, the ruler would want to bring peace to the Seven Kingdoms and these practices can't be allowed to continue. 

Now sure, you can forbid the Iron Islanders with threats and tell the Dothraki ""Thanks for your service. Bye-bye now"" - but that's just kicking the problem away without dealing with it. The Dothraki would go back to Essos and start their pillaging ways again. Meanwhile, the Iron Islanders will seethe and foment and wait for a chance to plunder again. And about once every century, they'd attempt a rebellion, only to be put down. 


So is there any way to actually reform these cultures and integrate them with the ""civilized"" society of the rest of the Seven Kingdoms? What steps should a king or queen try to take in order to solve this problem in a more permanent manner?",gameofthrones,True,1521565534,2018-03-20

[SPOILERS] Prove Me Wrong: Jon Snow = Moron,"This tirade pertains exclusively to the events taking place in Seasons 6 and 7. Seasons 1 - 5 Jon Snow was a hella decent character, and that's most likely due to his show material still being drawn from G.R.R.M's writing at that point in time. 


**Claim**: Jon Snow is a moron.


**Reason 1**: Taking into account that Jon Snow had 0 idea Sansa Stark + Petyr Baelish were going to save the day at the Battle of Winterfell, he should have perceived the coming battle as a guaranteed loss; end of story. He simply did not have the numbers (which he himself states). He does offer a bit of reasoning behind his decision to proceed with the battle anyway (""Battles have been won with worse odds."") However, he offers 0 strategies that might compensate for his lower numbers. Contrast this with the Battle of Blackwater Bay where Tyrion, faced with the knowledge that Stannis's forces were enough to take King's Landing, devised the wildfire strategy to at least have a fighting chance. You might think that with insufficient numbers AND a lack of brilliant strategy that Jon Snow would at least heed Sansa's advice to not fall into Ramsay Bolton's traps. However, what happens at the very beginning of the Battle of Winterfell? He falls into Ramsay Bolton's -obvious- trap. 

**Reason 2**: Despite not having anywhere near the numbers needed for a victory at the Battle of Winterfell, Jon Snow goes ""eff it"" and decides to proceed anyway. If the battle had been lost, the results would have been -disastrous- for the houses that decided to remain loyal to the Stark name. Sansa Stark would also be placed in extremely hot water having galloped around the North inciting a rebellion against House Bolton. This extreme lack of care about the fates of these individuals is almost entirely contradictory with the value Jon seems to place on Rickon Stark's life. It's also entirely contradictory with Jon Snow's concern about preparing for the fight against the White Walkers. How does a suicide mission help that cause in any way?


**Reason 3**: Accepts the ""King in the North"" title. After the disastrous and tragic events that followed Robb Stark's crowning as King in the North, Jon Snow should have known better than to hastily accept the same title that inspired jealousy of and betrayal towards House Stark (which culminated in the Red Wedding). Indeed, the vast majority of houses in the North remained obedient to House Bolton until the Battle of Winterfell was won. What on Earth makes it a good idea to call yourself King of all these houses? Is that not  guaranteed to lead to spite and hatred? Why would Jon Snow trust the loyalty of the houses who didn't even support him against House Bolton?

Also, why would Jon Snow accept such a title while Ned Stark's trueborn and capable daughter is sitting right next to him? Jon Snow is characterized as the kind of guy that cares a lot about honor and doing things ""the right way"". Knowing Westeros's culture and extreme bias towards bastards, the most pragmatic thing to do would be to support Sansa Stark as Queen in the North. She has a stronger claim AND Jon Snow knows she's not a moron. This makes sense as Sansa effectively won the Battle of Winterfell and is therefore responsible for the North being liberated from House Bolton. Without Sansa it would've been ez pz for House Bolton to squash Jon. 

**Reason 4**: Jon Snow decides to let the Karstarks and Umbers keep their castles, titles, and lands. The houses that decided to support Jon in the Battle of Winterfell were effectively sacrificing themselves out of loyalty. The odds of winning were absolutely awful and they pressed on anyways. They put their necks out for the Stark family and sent their sons and daughters to violent deaths to honor their oaths. Instead of rewarding these families for their sacrifice and providing an incentive to remain loyal to the Starks, what does Jon Snow do? He  prioritizes the ""unfair fate"" of 2 children (who aren't even being executed) for their family's horrible betrayal. Put yourself in the shoes of the houses who fought for Jon in the Battle of Winterfell. Imagine your sacrifices and bloodshed being completely disregarded even though Jon Snow would have NEVER been King in the North without their assistance. 

In addition to a lack of incentive for loyalty, Jon Snow now establishes the precedent that traitorous houses need not worry about their children when they decide to screw House Stark. Their children pretty much have ""insurance"" which gives would-be traitors an ENORMOUS amount of security. They now know that their children and the future of their house are A-ok regardless of the misdeeds they pull off.

**Reason 5**: Probably the freshest evidence in everyone's memory is how Cersei is literally about to swear to support the fight against the Night King contingent on Jon Snow remaining neutral. Jon Snow's entire character revolves around prioritizing the fight against the Dead. That's literally what his entire arc is about. Jon Snow recognizes that if not everyone cooperates to stop the Dead they are pretty much dead. 

What does Jon Snow do? Swears loyalty to Daenerys Targaryen in Cersei's face. This RUINS the entire point of negotiating with Cersei to begin with. This RUINS Westeros's best chance of surviving the fight against the Dead. Just like other characters say, he could have simply lied and attempted to secure Cersei's assistance. But nope. For some reason he let his loyalty to Daenerys completely outweigh his concern about defeating the Army of the Dead and saving Westeros. (Please don't counter that Cersei was going to dishonor her vow anyway; Jon Snow did not factor that into his decision at all). 


**Conclusion**: I honestly feel that this might all be on purpose. It reminds me of Rhaegar Targaryen (who everyone said was an amaaazing person and ruler omg *fangurl squeal*) who decided to run off into the sunset with Lyanna Stark, screwing over his house and pretty much inciting Robert's Rebellion. It's just displeasing to me how the climax of this story seems to be revolving mostly around Jon Snow/Daenerys Targaryen when one of them is just a ""mad dog without a strategic thought in his head"" and seems to face 0 consequences for his impulsive choices.",gameofthrones,True,1521588680,2018-03-20
[NO SPOILERS] Loving my A Game Of Thrones: Illustrated Edition book!,"Never watched the HBO series besides seeing a few clips here and there, but I've always wanted to start watching the show. I'm waiting to find someone to watch it with though, as I want to experience all the crazy moments with someone else and not by myself. I'm sure they'll release a complete series on Blu-Ray once Season 8 is finished, so I'll probably buy that and hope I find someone to watch it with.

Anyway, I've been reading through the first book and I'm currently really enjoying it. I'm about on page 140, so I still have like 700 pages to go. But, I really love my Illustrated Edition version of the book, as it's well made and the pictures help me imagine the scene better in my head.

(Spoilers All) Has Mirri Maz Duur’s prophecy been fulfilled in Season 7?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1520151330,2018-03-04
[Official] Has Mirri Maz Duur’s prophecy been fulfilled in Season 7?,"I don't know if this theory was ever brought up before (I never read it) so I wanted to bring it up -

The prophecy says: ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur, ""When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""

In the last episode of season 7, Bran and Sam realized that Jon is the legitimate king of the seven kingdoms. This could mean that: the sun in the west (meaning the Targaryen from the west = Jon) has risen (now the heir to the throne), while the sun in east (meaning the Targaryen from the east = Dani) has set (no longer the heir) Plus, ""the seas go dry"" because winter has came and they froze and ""mountains blow in the wind like leaves"" when the wall has fallen..

[Main Spoilers] Reposting this because I made a mistake in the original post.,"GoT will definitely have the villain winning, and i think Littlefinger would make perfect sense. 
He’s supposedly “dead”, yet there are so many things that don’t add up. 
For example, the blonde girl giving him the coin of the Bravoos and whispering “your time is up” (increase your volume if you didn’t hear that the first time you watched the episode, understandable).
That same quote (your time is up) has been used by Littlefinger actor in an interview. 
He knows what’s coming to him, as he said, he assumed the worst so he’s never unprepared. He’s no fool, he knows Sansa wants to kill him. Why?
Because he assumed the worst about her. 
His grandfather is from Bravoos as he mentioned, so it’s no surprise that he would know a Faceless Man (The blonde girl, a faceless man, could indeed have died in his place and fool everyone)

I think Winterfell was filmed there (I know the castle itself isn't there), but I think some of the filming spots of the Iron Islands, The King's Road, Dragonstone, and the Dothraki Sea were filmed there.

Jaime goes to the riverlands and it is a matter of convincing them to join the war against the dead, but what he does not know is that Cersei had already foreseen this and he made the army of the riverlands accompany him and later in the night kill by surprise the northerners and the Dany Forces, I am sure is not yet the Attack of NK (that was seen in the filmed video of winterfell) it is only the army of the land of the rivers that Cersei sent to finish by surprise with his enemies or at least weaken them, And Cersei well knows that Jaime does not He is a man known for his '' Good Honor '', so he was automatically blamed for what happened, although he also knows that he was not killed because it is Tyrion who interceded for him.

[OFFICIAL] Sansa Stark's fate,"Now Sansa Stark is a character that has grown, She has whined from an annoying little girl into a much more likeable and strong leader, and now with LF finally out of the picture and surviving through years of abuse from the Lannisters (minus Tyrion) and the Boltons she has returned home and has adopted the Stark colours finally. So it will be interesting to see where she goes next season, But what will happen to her? Well I believe that Sansa will die next season now before you call me crazy I will give you my evidence and then explain how I think it will go down:

- First up we need to establish each Stark direwolf represents each of there fates or where there story is headed. First Jon's direwolf Ghost is white and the Runt representing Jon's ""Bastard"" Lineage with the white fur maybe Forshadowing for Jon being a Targaryen as Targs have white blonde hair, Grey Wind Robb's direwolf was killed and we know what happened to Robb now the Direwolves name I can't find a connection to it that related to anything that happened in Robb's story yet so if anyone can help me on this one please do, Rickon named his Shaggydog which means Rickon's story in books and show is a Shaggydog story, Summer Bran's Direwolf died in the tree with Bran (metaphorically) and also his name Summer means Bran could be the one to bring the end of Winter and the Dream of Spring/Summer, and Arya named her Direwolf Nymeria who is now a wild Direwolf like how Arya is wild and like Nymeria Arya may lead her own pack someday. Sansa's Direwolf is named Lady who of course symbolises Sansa being a Lady but the fact the Direwolf died could mean Sansa will die.

- With the way the show is going there is no more room for Political players like LF or Olenna, With the true threat coming Words will not stop the WW's which means the Writers may want to kill off Sansa as there will not be much for her to do.

- Sansa has had a lot of close calls with death, Maybe it will not be for this time.

- A lot of people think Sansa will live to the end, Which is a Plus for the possibility of her dying.

- There has been some Forshadowing for this, In Season 5 Sansa tells Ramsey to just kill her already I can't remember what she said exactly but it was something like that also in Season 7 when she tells Arya that she has men loyal to her Arya replies that they are not here right now which could mean nobody will be there to protect her.

So how will this go down well one of two ways, Either with the WW""s pushing Jon and Dany's forces back I think one of the Wagons carrying Citizens will have Sansa in it, It will be attack and Sansa will get wounded by a WW Arya will come in and save Sansa from the WW with the Dagger she will try to carry her away from the battle but Sansa will make Arya leave before they can kill her too, Sansa would then either bleed out or the NK will find her and finish her off. Or at some point when the Lannisters or GC attack both Arya and Sansa will be left behind and Sansa will put Arya on the last horse and has her ride off while Sansa stays to be taken hostage to KL, Where she would be beheaded under orders from Cersei (paralleling her father).",gameofthrones,True,1520210834,2018-03-04

[MAIN SPOILERS] Let's talk about that persons plan for a second.,"It's revealed that Littlefinger was the reason Lysa sent the letter to Catelyn about Jon Aryns death.

Why?

To my understanding, it's so Ned can go be the hand of the king where Littlefinger can manipulate him because of his honor.

But shortly into their relationship Littlefinger makes his intentions clear to Ned, so what gives?

I understand that he has to call audibles. But was his intended plan? I'm not clear on this and it seems to be pretty important.

Arya goes to KL to kill Cersei. She gets caught and is put on trial. She choses trial by combat. Jon offers to be her champion as does Brienne and Jorah. However they would be considered acts of wars if they so so. So Arya says she will be her own champion. Meanwhile the Hound is moping around KL. Seeing the commotion regarding the trial, he goes to the trial by combat. Arya fights the Mountain. At first she does good but the Mountain gets the better of her. Befire he kills her, the Hound steps forward and enters the fray. Now the fight gets interesting and real gritty like Dan Dority and the the Captain in Deadwood or Vorenus vs final Gladitor in Rome. Finally the Hound uses fire to burn Mountain before gorging out his eyes. Mountain finally dead. Hound fatally wounded. He asks Arya for wine. Drinks it and tells her to do it. She stabs him in the heart. Last words are "" I guess im finally off your list"" or ""Im glad it was you who did it."" What do you think.

"[OFFICIAL] Best casting decisions for shorter-lived, less popular characters","I've seen on all of the GOT/ASOIAF subs questions about who people think are the best-cast actors in the show. The more popular ones I've seen are always Charles Dance as Tywin, Conleth Hill as Varys, Aidan Gillen as Littlefinger, Sophie Turner as Sansa, Rory McCann as Sandor, Liam Cunningham as Davos, Stephen Dillane as Stannis, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey, etc. But now I'd like to focus on characters that either died a while ago or don't get as much love and/or mainstream attention, but were portrayed by actors who fit their character really well naturally and/or did an incredible job bringing them to life. Below are some examples of these type of characters that I feel were incredibly well-cast, but please let me know what you think as well!


James Cosmo as Jeor Mormont - When reading the books Cosmo looks exactly as I pictured LC Mormont in my head. His old bear-ish appearance, the way he speaks, his mannerisms, etc. He just really looked like a guy who seems well-respected, a seasoned veteran, and deserving of the title of Lord Commander.

Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo - Momoa has become increasingly popular in the mainstream in recent years, but even so I feel like his performance as Drogo is often overlooked when it comes to the best performances on the show. Momoa isn't just great for Khal Drogo, in my mind he is an incredibly accurate representation of the Dothraki people as a whole. His intensity, body language, and of course his appearance exemplify everything the Dothraki are about. Savageness, strong leadership and stubbornness. Not to mention Momoa did a New Zealand Haka in his audition tape, which when you watch will make you automatically understand why he got the role of Drogo.

Anton Lesser as Qyburn - I wouldn't say Lesser took my vision of Qyburn to life, but rather he created a version of Qyburn performed so well that when I think back to the books I can't picture him any other way. He does an incredible job of portraying Qyburn as a somewhat nerdy, mad scientist (perhaps best exemplified in the S7 Dragon Pit scene when he sees the wight for the first time) while also invoking enough charisma to rise up through the ranks and be a loyal sidekick to a ruthless ruler. I get some serious Darth Sidious vibes from Qyburn too.

Gemma Whelan as Asha/Yara Greyjoy - Despite the fact that I feel the show royally screwed up the entire Ironborn plot, Whelan's portrayal of Asha/Yara has been one of the lone bright spots of this part of the show. She has great chemistry with Alfie Allen, as well as all the other Iron men who she commands respect from. She did a great job letting her humorous side shine through, and also does a great job of portraying a tomboy-ish girl who has abandoned almost all femininity.

Julian Glover as Pycelle - Fun fact, Roy Dotrice (narrator of the audiobooks, also plays the pyromancer in S2) was actually supposed to play Pycelle but had to back out late due to health concerns. Although I'm sure I would've enjoyed seeing Pycelle mispronounce names (Bry-eeeeene, Pehtiiiire, Dam-fair), Glover does a really really good job of portraying a sickly old man. His hunched-over posture, always sounding like there's something stuck in his throat, his reaction to Tyrion's punishing of him in S2, it's all amazing. You really get the vibe that he's sort of a joke, and often times it's really comical. Plus, the deleted scene with Pycelle and Tywin adds a lot to the Pycelle character, and I thought Glover did an incredible job rapidly shifting his posture, attitude and voice here.

Kate Dickie as Lysa Arryn - When I met Dickie at last summer's Con of Thrones, I was flabbergasted to hear just how strong of a Scottish accent she has. She truly sounds absolutely nothing like her character, which is a testament to her acting chops and ability to get into character. Dickie did a great job playing the stereotypical ""crazy bitch,"" and she was a stark contrast to the portrayal of Catelyn (see what I did there). Whereas I felt Catelyn exhibits poise (most of the time at least), intelligence and lady-like qualities, Dickie's Lysa truly felt like an off-the-rails, B-grade Tully compared to her sister. You could really see ultra levels of paranoia on Lysa's face, as well as a deep layer of envy towards Catelyn that is present in both S1 and S4.

Tom Wlaschiha as Jaqen H'ghar - One of the high points of S2 was the chemistry between Wlashchiha and Maisie Williams. I can't say if the same magic is present in S5 or S6, but considering Wlaschiha is really just a surrogate Kindly Man from the books, and considering the butchering of the faceless men plot in the show, I'm leaving my analysis strictly to the Jaqen H'ghar in S2 as the rest of the stuff could be attributed to the writers. Wlashchiha does an excellent job of portraying Jaqen as a seemingly calm, soft-spoken and generally nice bloke, despite there obviously being a lot more under the surface. I think Wlashchiha does a good job of this too, as despite what he seems, you always get the feeling there's something much darker underneath. He embodied the character from the books. In particular, his pleading with Arya to unname him is one of the best moments of S2.

After eating much humble pie, we'll be trialling [Spoilers] as the go-to tag rather than [Official]. [Main] was the other option being considered, but we're going to try [Spoilers] first (and hopefully last).

If you'd like the full info on the spoiler changes, you can check the **[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/814x5k/mod_raven_were_simplifying_the_spoiler_tags_heres/)**. Keeping this one to the basics:

#The three tags are:

* **[No Spoilers]** - For new watchers or those who are wary.

[SPOILERS] The Night King's plan to get past The Wall,"I don't know about anyone else but I had spent years wondering how the night king would eventually get past the wall, how would the army of the dead make it through into the seven kingdoms. 

I just thought that there would be a previous plan in place rather than the wall being brought down by ice-dragon fire. Viserion is with Dany for 6 entire seasons in Essos, nowhere near the wall. During that entire time the army of the dead is constantly moving southwards. Then she comes to westeros, the night king is still going south. Jon Snowbro and Co. go to 'kidnap a wight' past the wall and the nights king is hot on their heels, cornering them. Dany and her dragons go to save the day, and suddenly the nights king has found his way past the wall, it's come flying up to him on a plate.

IDK it just irked me a little bit, I would have thought there was a plan in place, that something else would have happened. I'm not saying it wasn't an entertaining thing to watch, just that it didn't seem like how this massive moment, YEARS in the making, would have panned out. Like you couldn't have told me in S7E5 that that was how the wall would be broken.",gameofthrones,True,1520298840,2018-03-05

It can't be hard to make her a little more curvy for a little while, right? It would have been amusing as a viewer to see her getting heavier during a lot of this.

[Spoilers] Arya to save Sansa in a way we all might have missed?,"I'm sold on the theory that the starks are connected to their direwolves. It's a popular theory that just makes so much sense. You can read about it online just about anywhere. The only confusing part is what Sansa's direwolves fate is trying to tell us. I believe the secret has been laying in plain sight all along with telling clues as to how it happens. It may sound unbelievable but we all know how GRRM writes and this is a fantasy show where anything can happed. So here it is.... 

I think at some point during battle Ned will be resurrected as a wight and kill Sansa, or Arya will have to make the choice to kill her father again with her Catspaw dagger or save her sister, possible getting herself killed instead. It sounds a little out there but it's very possible and here's why.

-Neds remains where brought back to Caitlyn to be buried in the crypts. It seems like the Crypts of winterfell are emphasized so much in the show for a reason. Is so possible they are setting us up for this great reveal in season 8 where a few if not everyone is raised up from the dead. 

-The whole show is surrounded by Neds death and honor. Ofter Arya and Sansa think and talk of Ned but not their mother and Brother. They meet in the cripts of winterfell infront of Neds statue and talk about how much they miss him, and how they are the only ones alive who knows his face.

-The whole controversy surrounding Arya and Sansa started with the Direwolves. Aryas was suppose to be the one executed but Sansa's took its place. Sansa told Arya ""It would have been you they executed.""

-Ned Stark was the one to kill the wolf, which might mean he will be the one to kill Sansa or Arya. 

-You could reverse it and say, since Arya's wolf was meant to die all along not Sansas, so she could sacrifice herself to save Sansa which would be a nice twist since they have built up so much surrounding the sisters and their father.

-At one point Sansa says, ""No one can save me, No one can save anyone."" Could be a reference Arya. 
 
-Or Sansa could be killed by him before Arya can get to her. Sansa has survived so much and to be killed that way would be a epic way to go out. It's like your starting all over.

-Arya has a huge part to play in the war to come with that dagger, and I think this would just be another sad moment for a character who loves her father as much as she does. 

This is the first time I've heard this theory, so there is not much evidence surrounding it. I'm sure you guy can dig up more stuff but as of now I really think this is a possibility. ",gameofthrones,True,1520364945,2018-03-06
[Spoilers] Why can't GRRM finish ASOIAF?,"[Here's GRRM GoT outline from 1993.](http://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-original-story-2017-8) (warning while back in 1993, potential spoilers)

This initial conceptual idea changed as GRRM started writing. While it may offer hints of things still to come, it is more likely that paths that GRRM started down as he started writing the books diverged from this early plan. That is to be expected.

But Martin also says this about himself: ""As you know, I don't outline my novels. I find that if I know exactly where a book is going, I lose all interest in writing it. "" Hmmm...

GRRM is stuck: He did give D+D where this story would end. The HBO Series is way more detailed than an outline. Now he has to write the remaining story completely different from the show (which is an unusual place for an author like GRRM to be) or follow the show (which I would imagine would be tediously boring to GRRM). The success of the show has become a trap for the author of the books.

Unless the books take a completely different path from the show (which would be interesting, especially if D+D give us a lame ending), I suspect GRRM will never finish the final book himself. It seems even *Winds of Winter* may not be released till after Season 8. After he passes, his estate may well have others finish the book(s) for him.  ",gameofthrones,True,1520369590,2018-03-06
[Spoilers] Discussion of characters that parallel Faith of the Seven,"I am sitting here thinking about all the different religions in the world of ice and fire, and a lot of people talk about the lord of light and azor ahai. The faith of the seven is also a large religion in Westeros, and I’d like to see what everyone’s thoughts are if we were to draw parallels between the 7 (the father, mother, maiden, etc.) and characters who are fighting the night king currently. For example- GRRM is amazing at using characters that seemingly represent one thing to represent something else in the bigger picture. I’ll start by saying the obvious that the night king would most likely parallel the stranger, while Jon snow would parallel the warrior. I’m not sure who would best fit the other 5 gods.

[OFFICIAL] A Theory/Prediction on Bran Stark,"Okay so was re-watching some scenes from previous seasons on YT and I realized something, I think Bran is going to try and use his powers longer then he is suppose too and may stay in for too long. Now I don't think he will become the NK but I think he will try to go back (when he is at the God's eye) and look into the original Long Night, the First defeat of the NK, and how to defeat him. I believe he will stay in too long and will almost ""Drown"", But Howland Reed (yes I think Howland Reed needs to show up before the end) will go in and save him and will however die in the process.

Evidence:

- Jojen told Bran in S4 that he can't stay in there for too long

- 3ER tells Bran the Ocean is beautiful, stay down for too long however and you'll drown or something like that.

- Howland Reed has too appear he has been mentioned so many times, Appeared in the Tower of Joy in S6, and finally he was the one who send Jojen and Meera and we need to learn why. If Howland was not important he would not have been shown in S6.",gameofthrones,True,1520389828,2018-03-06

"[NO SPOILERS] So, we can all just admit that Game of Thrones is the best, right?","I never thought I would find myself on reddit. If you were to ask me in 2017 what reddit was, I would likely be humiliated by my response. Honestly, everything leading up to 2018 is practically meaningless to me now, and I do not say that cold-heartedly. I simply state this bold proclamation because my eyes were recently opened, my soul was recently cleansed, and my spirit has discovered a new-found admiration. I have always been a fan of entertainment; it was something that raised me, inspired me, and influenced me everyday. I happen to have a vast amount of critical opinions on various films, productions, shows, and documentaries. I am no acclaimed film critic by any means, nor do I wish to be. I just want to talk about how awesome Game of Thrones is. Like, seriously. The show astonishes me in so many different ways on so many different levels, and because of that I cannot genuinely compare or contrast it upon any other production. Lord of the Rings is often compared to Game of Thrones for obvious reasons, but the cold hard truth is that J.R.R. Tolkiens classic no longer competes with the reborn story of A Song of Ice and Fire. This may be a hot take, but know that this is coming from a 21 year old with a LotR poster on his wall; the reality of this sucks for me too :( lol. I have become the biggest advocate of Game of Thrones since I began watching it this year, and I think my bandwagon fanboy-ness is starting to lowkey annoy my friends. Sorry not sorry guys. Every aspect of this show is superior to any bit of film I have ever witnessed though, and I say this with the upmost confidence. The origin, casting, acting, scenery, storylines, cinematography, special effects, alchemy, witchcraft, fire-breathing dragons, love scenes, fighting scenes, jousting scenes, ughhh, pretty much all scenes are spectacular! I recommend this to anyone who is seriously looking for something to get into. You can be like me and completely geek out on it, or you can watch it purely for enjoyment. Everything about the series is appealing and it only gets better as you progress through the story. Like I said, it's kind of surreal for me to be on reddit right now, and the fact that i'm talking about Game of Thrones is even more bizarre. But this show is seriously on another level when it comes to cinematography and it is now making me speak out of character. It will change you, for real; and I promise it will be worth it! We can justify all of this talk of superiority by the number of Emmy and Golden Globe wins and nominations it has received, but that would just be rubbing it in the face of the rest of the film industry. The thing I admire most about this series is that every character provokes you to feel a certain way about them, and the exceptional script writing always keeps you entertained with unpredictable plots and twists you shouldn't miss. Watch it while you can, fore winter is coming!",gameofthrones,True,1520400811,2018-03-07
[SPOILERS] What is bittersweet about Death itself bending the knee?,"At the end of season 5, when asked about Jon's fate, Dave/Dan said ""Dead is dead."" A few days later, when a fan was quizzing GRRM, he slyly replied ""Oh, you think he's dead, do you?"" More recently, GRRM has hinted at Jon being a fire wight (he talks about poor Berric, and going back to the whole ice and fire thing when he mentioned this). Dave/Dan have also said they consider the Night King not to be a person, but death itself. I suspect they're all enjoying these cryptic messages. I wonder if Jon or the Night King kill each other, if this will destroy all the magic in the realm - killing Dani and her dragons, and the fire that keeps both Dany and Jon alive - that shockwave that came out in a spoiler, and if this is why the Night King is not interested in killing Jon, but more interested in killing anyone (Bran) who would be able to help Jon find the key to killing him. This would explain the sudden emergence south, the trigger was probably Jon's birth. This might explain the bittersweet ending - and a dream of spring is a world without magic - where Jon and Dani's miracle baby is the reference to bittersweet (a common theme at the end of wars is the children who will survive). The Azor Ahai prophecy has an interesting ending that everyone seems to be ignoring: ""death itself will bend its knee, and all those who die fighting in his/her cause shall be reborn."" Note again, ""death itself will bend the knee"" and the showrunners refer to the Night King as death rather than a character. Will they really resurrect/reanimate everyone who dies fighting with Jon/Dani? I doubt it. But it is an interesting line.﻿",gameofthrones,True,1520402986,2018-03-07
[EVERYTHING] Theory: The Mountain Clans of the Vale will play an important role in Season 8.,"When tyrion first met them, it wasn't giving them trinkets, and promising them Castle Forged Steel, that won them over, and convinced them to Save his &amp; Bronns life, as well as help him safely back home, and become loyal to him, fighting for him. He promised them ""this"", and when they asked what ""this"" is, he told them ""You shall become the new lords of the Vale"". Telling them for centuries the Vale has spat upon the hilltribes. He told them he thinks it's time for new rulers of the Vale. That is the key thing that made the stonecrows, burned men, Black Ears, Moon Brothers...etc, join up with Tyrion. The trinkets and steel they were given was just the appetizer. 

There's going to be power struggle with the Vale now that Petyr is dead. House Royce mentioned they were only there for Sansa, not John. They seemed annoyed that a great house was seemingly now following the orders of a King in the North whom they barely knew. I suspect they will leave Winterfell, going back to the Vale, and there's gonna be chaos over who becomes Lord Protector. Robyn will not take the news of Uncle Petryrs execution well, I actually suspect he will declare war on the North for what they did to Petyr. He was the only person Robyn would listen to, and was manipulated masterfully into loving Baelish. He literally has no one else, Sansa was the only one, but she's not going to go back to the Vale. 

This is where Dany will gain the Vale, as her hand just happens to have a very special relationship with thousands of clansmen all remembering what they were promised. The eerie is impregnable, but Dragons...yeah, they can fly right up to the top of the Vale. No seige needed. The current lords of the Vale, well...who knows. But a Lannister always pays his debts.",gameofthrones,True,1520414207,2018-03-07
[SPOILERS] Varys and the realm,"I got to thinking about Varys and in season one about him wanting what is best for the realm. I have a hard time imagining that the realm would do well if the Dothraki had made it over much sooner and killed a substantial amount of people.

At the time, Robert was alive (the conversation between him and Ilyrio). Was he going to kill Robert? I mean you can make a case that the Lannisters leading was bad for the realm but a lot of innocents would have needed to fall to the Dothraki.

I still think we haven't seen Varys' ultimate goal. ",gameofthrones,True,1520416849,2018-03-07

[SPOILERS] Is the Night king a god?,"He had more magical power than any other character in the show. The lord of light has shown his power of resurrection, flaming swords, shadow babies etc. but used a human champion “prince(ss) that was promised”. So the night king is the champion of the darkness who brings the long night and a never ending winter but is he also the god of darkness just put into a form where he can clearly command and intimidate the warriors of light?",gameofthrones,True,1520433943,2018-03-07
[SPOILERS] Random Thought About Jon and His Ending,"So GRRM has notoriously stated that the ending to the series will be bitter sweet. We've speculated as to what that can mean to no end, but I have another theory.


Jon is as reluctant as a leader can possibly be. He's been chosen to lead, and he feels obligated to protect his people. But with the current events - like his true bloodline and the couple of people who know about it - isn't it at all possible he never finds out who he really is? You'd have a somewhat poetic ending to his character if you went that route.


With the Night King flying around on his dragon, straight toward Winterfell, the knowledge regarding Jon is in harm's way.


Now if Dany dies, as a lot of people think she will, Jon would more than likely be the last man standing to take the Iron Throne. But again, he's reluctant because A)He doesn't want the role and B)He most likely doesn't feel he deserves it as he is a bastard.


I just think it would be interesting to have Jon sit on the throne, thinking he doesn't deserve it and he doesn't want it, yet we know that it is his rightful place.",gameofthrones,True,1520437408,2018-03-07
[Spoilers] Who is the worst showrunner you can think of to be in charge of GOT?,"As much as some people have issues with the series, I think that we have a pretty epic series that will go down as a classic and stand the test of time.  D&amp;D deserve high praise for this, in my opinion.  But it could have gone a different way and been a disaster from the start.  Who, if chosen to be showrunner,/head writer(s), would have completely killed this series before it even started?

My main choice would be Scott Gimple.  What he and his team have done to The Walking Dead is just downright criminal.  Horrible dialogue, bad cinematography, important characters sidelined for weeks and weeks.  Terrible pacing with almost no time passing throughout a 16 episode season.  You get the idea.

A runner up for me would be Joss Whedon.  I love his work, but I definitely don't think it would translate well to GOT.  Too much humor and self awareness.


Who else would have been a bad choice?  (I'm mainly looking for semi-realistic choices.  They would never, for example, give the show to Tommy Wiseau, but hey, no rules).",gameofthrones,True,1520441220,2018-03-07

"[SPOILERS] Tyrion's plan was never for convincing Cersei, it was always for Jamie and the long game","Like most other viewers, I was supremely disappointed in Tyrion's apparent stupidity in the last season. I mean trapping a wight and transporting it all the way to King's Landing is crazy enough, but the idea that literally anything could win Cersei over to Team Jon/Dany seemed idiotic. If anyone should know that wouldn't work, it should be Tyrion.

Maybe he knew full well it wouldn't convince Cersei. What if the plan all along was to undermine Jamie's relationship with Cersei. He knew Jamie would surely be there to see the wight and knows that Jamie is infinitely more reasonable than Cersei is. There's two big gets from this for Tyrion:

1) **Jamie:** a competent field commander, effective liege lord of the Westerlands, and Tyrion's beloved big bro. 

2) **An even more unstable Cersei:** In S7 Jamie is the only ounce of rationality Cersei has left in her life. Taking Jamie away would not only hurt her emotionally (maybe?), but would also be a huge blow to the sanity of KL's leadership. This might make her an easier foe to conquer. Remember Tyrion preaches non-violence the whole season, effectively crippling Dany's #1 asset (the dragons). But if Cersei goes full-on Vlad the Impaler inside KL, then the commonfolk might happily welcome Dany's dragonfire as the lesser of two evils. 

Maybe Tyrion is re-arranging the pieces of the cyvasse board to make better use of Dany's strengths.

One remaining question:

**Why hide this from Jon and Dany?** It's possible that they wouldn't think Jamie was worth all this effort, but Tyrion does. That's his big bro, and maybe he feels like he owes it to Jamie. Remember Jamie helped Varys save Tyrion's life by freeing him from the Red Keep. Tyrion might be trying to do the same for Jamie. Tyrion also uniquely understands the repercussions of removing Jamie from Cersei's life.

Edit: I feel like I should clarify that the probability of this being true is slim. As other have pointed out, it would require the writers to be a lot more competent than they've been in the past. This is more just some personal headcanon that allows me to retain some respect for Tyrion in the show.",gameofthrones,True,1520457639,2018-03-07

The ups and downs in the stories were like a mix of adventure stories and ASOIAF (which I just loved). And even tho at the start of the first two adventures I found myself “predicting” the general path of the story, i quickly realized that this is the same old GRRM and of course HE would never let me hold on to what I thought was me outsmarting HIM (especially for the last adventure) what I’m trying to say is it’s still as unpredictable as ASOIAF. In the end, I freaking love Dunk and Egg and I can’t see what adventures they take on next.

[Spoilers] In regards to Jon Snow....,"Is the amount of proof that they have saying that he is the likely rightful heir to the throne even going to be enough? I'm honestly a little worried that the evidence of his own brother's word and a sentence in a book are going to be enough to even warrant him making a claim to the throne. If it did work, would Khaleesi even relent to him being the true head? Would the kingdom accept them being married and ruling together with the incest involved? Besides that possibility, I'm worried that she is showing signs of going mad. She is smart enough to surround herself with aids that can balance her out, but she seems to already be having trouble accepting Tyrion's advice when he tries to stop her from causing massive bloodshed. This could even end up being her undoing in the end and give her people a reason to abandon her and get behind Jon. There's a ton of possibilities.

[SPOILERS] Does Jon Snow’s lineage matter ?,"Point in case in UK monarchy 

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/25/richard-iii-dna-tests-uncover-evidence-of-further-royal-scandal

This is only one of many twists and turns in the way the throne was handed down - traditionally the legitimate lineage was the male line through marriage (although there may be other legitimate ways too?) however deviations from this were frequent also lineage is obviously a concern high on Dany’s agenda as we have seen

As well as the above recent discovery its worth noting that William the Conqueror was actually a bastard 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror

William Snow ?

So legitimate also depends on the size of ur army, skill and luck

In this regards this suggests Cersei is in with a good chance unless of course death eg The Night King claims her

EDIT: Consensus from comments suggests many more specific variables that may influence taking the throne such as conquest (pretty related to size of ur army), current political climate at the time, parliament/laws etc and of course lineage but for me lineage is a difficult one because there are so many twists and turns in the handover of the crown based on lineage - the male child line from marriage was traditionally the legitimate claim but this was very often not the case in real history

EDIT 2: Another user pointed out that legitimacy is what gives you a sizeable army - to add to this legitimacy has often historically been based on lineage (although not the only factor) so lineage does matter - however my argument would be that lineage is a perception often not necessarily based on hard facts - so those that can put forward the most widely believed arguments amongst the most powerful houses could win - skill and luck come into play",gameofthrones,True,1520474932,2018-03-07

[SPOILERS] Azor Ahai theory,"I started thinking earlier about the prince that was promised prophecy. The books and show mention this multiple times but never really give too much attention to it (except for stannis but everyone knew he wasn’t the right guy) so I started running through my head a list of characters I’ve seen that could be Azor Ahai reborn and there towards the bottom of the list, I thought of one I haven’t seen many theories surrounding...Gendry. A lot of people overlook this character as a possible promised prince because of him being base born but remember folks...Kings and queens can legitimize bastards. So for all intents and purposes, Gendry is a prince. Now it’s told that Azor Ahai must forge his weapon by killing someone he/she loved with it so this theory is that in S8, Gendry and Arya will have a bunch of flirtations that turn out to be love; Jon, Dany, and the dragons all die leaving Gendry to lead with Davos and Jaime advising him (Jaime is offered command but knows he is not a leader but a soldier); Jon legitimizes Gendry from his deathbed (similar to scene with Robert giving the regency to Ned); Gendry will kill Arya fulfilling the prophecy and making him Azor Ahai reborn; and Gendry defeats the night king and his army (his dragon was defeated by Jon and Dany) and becomes king of Westeros.
Now do I think this is a likely ending for the show? Absolutely not. This would involve a ton of character development and setup that would just look sloppy packing into one final season. I just thought I’d share an interesting idea I had. I do think that Gendry may end up being legitimized and ruling in the end. When the show brought him back into the fold, I couldn’t really think of any reason why other than to have him end up as king. He could just be an attempted love plot for Arya but that would suck if that was the entire purpose of Gendry so I don’t wanna believe it lol. What do y’all think? Who is Azor Ahai? What will happen to Gendry in S8?",gameofthrones,True,1520484417,2018-03-07

[Spoilers] A Night King and Queen prediction/Theory I have,"Before I start my Theory, read this. This was Taken Straight from 'A Game of Thrones WIKI"", however I've seen it other places. This is long but bare with me.... Maybe if you all think about it and we can try and piece together a reason for this to work then maybe we have something valuable here. Maybe you all can even go off of what I said and come up with new Theories about it and new clues. Sometimes I'm not good a expressing what I'm trying to say.


(In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Night's King fell in love with a woman ""with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars""; he loved her though ""her skin was cold as ice"", and when he gave his seed to her he gave her his soul as well. He brought her to the Nightfort and bound the brothers of the Night's Watch to his will through sorcery. He declared himself ""Night's King"" and ruled over the Wall and The Gift as his own. The King in the North Brandon the Breaker and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces to defeat him and his queen. After their deaths, it was discovered that they had been making human sacrifices to the Others - the White Walkers. After their defeat, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along the Wall should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of the Night's King and Queen also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not ""rule"" the Wall but who serve the realms of men.)


Now reading this I started thinking. It says he ""gave her his seed."" and it wasn't discovered that they were making human sacrifices until after they were killed. What if she had a baby by him and it was sacrificed to the walkers and that baby ended up being the Night King because it would be 2 of different kinds of people. One from beyond the wall and behind the wall creating an ultimate force, thus being able to potentially be a warg because he can see the future like Bran. It's also why the Night king can raise up babies into White walkers. 

That seems bizzare but looking into it further I thought of this. The red woman is the most mysterious woman in the story. Why is she there and what does she really want. 


-The woman the Nights King fell in love with has blue eyes and white skin like The Red Woman. 


-Melisandre seems to be seducing everyone she thinks is a king for some reason, maybe for their seed just like this woman wanted. 

-She is making human sacrifices with stanis who she thinks is a king, just like that woman was. 


-Shes hundreds maybe even thousands of years old, putting her around the same age as the other woman. 


Maybe she is the same woman, and if so maybe the Night king now is the same man. They didn't exactly die, or maybe she didn't or was resurrected by the lord of light. Maybe she has been waiting for years for the dragons to finally come back so the Night King could use one the get himself beyond the wall. That's why their was a comet that everyone could see that signaled this. Or maybe she herself was the comet.



Maybe He is a Stark and her a Targaryan because of her ruby's, and skin and eye color. If the starks are somehow connected to the Night King then Maybe the Targaryan's are connected to the white walkers. If this is true, then furthermore maybe They need Jon (A Stark and Targaryan) and Danny (A Targaryan) To warg into taking their place on the Iron Throne. ""I've been ready to die for a long time"" and ""I must die in this strange city"" -Melisandre

[SPOILERS] A Quick Observation on Dany's Visions in The House of the Undying,"I've not seen it noted here anywhere so thought I would throw it out there. During Dany's visions, she encounters the throne room in the Red Keep in a state of ruin. While we could speculate endlessly on that aspect of her visions, it's what immediately follows that piqued my curiosity. Upon leaving the throne room, she exits and finds herself north of the wall. There, she makes her way to a tent where she is re-united with Khal Drogo and her stillborn son, Rhaego.

If these visions foretell of a future to come, then it would seem clear that Dany's end lies north of the wall, to join Drogo and Rhaego in the land of the dead, the Night Lands. Of course, this is hypothetical but it's something I keep coming back to when I think about how this whole thing will conclude.

[Spoilers] Great Council of 306 AC,"When it comes to the question of who should sit on the Iron Throne, the perspectives and arguments from various fans are rather well-known. But fan perspective need not be the same as that of Westerosi Nobility. So here, let's consider the question of who they would choose as their king/queen.


Let's say that the War for Dawn is over and all the major characters survive and play some part in human victory. Then, instead of restarting the war, they decide to call a Great Council to peacefully figure out who should sit on the throne. And in interests of fairness, everyone with an ambition towards ruling is allowed to throw their hat in the ring. So the candidates to choose from are - **Jon, Dany, Cersei, Tyrion, Jaime, Sansa, Varys, Euron and Yara**. And all lords, big and small, get a vote here. 


Now, there maybe some misconceptions about the Great Council. It is NOT the Kingsmoot where the lords choose the most popular candidate. Ideally, it is meant to resolve the legal issues regarding succession and figure out who, in the eyes of the lords of Westeros, happens to have the most legitimate claim to the throne. And its not necessarily limited to succession either. **Any other major issues - such as independence of the North or of the Iron Islands can be tabled here as well.** Most importantly, decisions of a Great Council would create a legally binding precedent that could be used to prevent or cause future wars. 


That is not to say, however, that the lords of Westeros could be swayed from the strict legal perspective. If the argument is strong enough, you can expect them to ignore all consideration of the law and make a judgment call. But let's not forget, all prejudices and preconceptions prevalent in the land would be applicable here. 


**Now you are an agent of the candidate (or cause) of your choosing.** You get to personally interact with the Lords 1-on-1. Your goal here is to come up with a strategy to ensure your candidate's (or cause's) victory through a majority vote. You'd need to convince as many people as possible. And since it'd be easy to convince - say, a Westerlands House that a Lannister should sit on the the throne - imagine that you are trying to convince a more recalcitrant lord - like someone from Stormlands. 


So what would your strategy be here? How would you convince the lords that your candidate should sit on the Iron Throne? And how would you convince them that any other cause you support would be the best course of action?",gameofthrones,True,1520558149,2018-03-08
[SPOILERS] Iron Bank vs Dany,"So the Iron Bank is giving Cersei a rather hefty loan to hire the Golden Company and fight Dany/Jon alliance. But the loan isn't to Cersei personally or to the Lannister family - its to the Iron Throne. So if Dany (or Jon, for that matter) wins and ends up on the Iron Throne, would she be expected to foot the bill?


Seems a little unfair, doesn't it? Having to pay the financiers of your enemy for funding a war against you? Do you think Dany would actually pay or would she tell them ""you gambled and you lost""? What course of action would Tyrion advice?


Also, would it actually be in the Bank's best interest to demand repayment or would they be better off absorbing the loss as a bad investment? We know that they have a habit of propping up rebellious princes and/or hiring the Faceless Men for issues like this - but if the dragons are back in play, would it be worth the risk?

"[SPOILERS] Rewatched 6x10, Tyrion's motive","Remember that pondering expression on Tyrions face at the end of Season 7; on the ship. When he was looking at Dany's cabin with Jon in it.

And only as another, unlikely option, that he might be a bit jealous, because he had feelings for Dany himself.

Recently i rewatched the finale of season 6 (because it's the best hour of tv ever produced, duh :D). And there is a scene, after Dany told Daario, that he has to stay. The scene where Tyrion says to her, that Daario wasn't the first to love her, and he won't be the last. And there is this longing look on Tyrions face.

So, he might very well be in love with Dany. At least, i'm now leaning to that option of interpretation of his season 7 look. Either way, this could very well be reason enough for him, to betray Dany. I just can't wait for season 8..",gameofthrones,True,1520595868,2018-03-09

Game of Thrones most intense scene in Hindi,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1520619270,2018-03-09
[spoilers] Theory regarding the Winterfell crypt and Bran.,"So this is working off of a few popular unconfirmed theories, that Bran due to time traveling shenanigans is the Night King, and has caused a lot of major story elements to take place. So to start i want you to think about a few things we know about Winterfell, one ""a Stark must always be in Winterfell"", and two that there is a crypt full of Stark lords and kings of the north equipped with swords. 

Why must there always be a stark in Winterfell? Whats special about the Starks, they have warg blood thanks to Bael the Bard bringing it over the wall. Assuming every thing is a result of Bran's time travel fuckery, we can surmise that Bran caused the infusion of wildling blood in to the Stark bloodline, because the greenseer must be a warg. The line there always has to be a Stark in Winterfell, may have been started by Bran to assure that he was there when needed, basically a hey it sucks here due to the weather, but Starks have to stay put due to future problems. 

Why does the crypt matter? We have already seen that the Night King and Bran are connected some how, whether it be the Night King marking him while projecting, or shutting down his warging in to a crow with a look, some how their powers are connected. Now while they both may be tapping in to the same power, a life and death yin yang type system, I think it's more likely they are one in the same. Ether way I think Bran might be able to raise the dead, again we have to assume Bran has seen every thing happen, but due to time travel he can shape events in a way to assure victory. They are arming there dead, ether the Night King is going to bring them back or Bran will, why else would GRM put in the lore that they have swords. Why is a blood line that has fought the Night King, not burning their dead instead of entombing, and arming them? 

I think Winterfell is going to need reinforcements and Bran will find them underground. GRM doesn't add any detail with out reason, there is always a call back or justification, but its rarely a cliche. In any other fantasy setting necromancy would always be bad, but in GOT Bran doing his thing to assure he would have well built armed corpses, to defend his and their home would seem right proper.

Didn’t mean much at the time but it now seems like a subtle hint of Ramsay’s identity.

[SPOILERS] A theory (or 2) about bastards in Season 8,[deleted],gameofthrones,True,1520709784,2018-03-10
[SPOILERS] Two Battles - One Big Conclusion About Ice and Fire,"I made a post a couple days ago on r/asoiaf that got a pretty good reaction explaining why I think Bran's visions in S6/E6 ""Blood of my Blood"" heavily foreshadowed a last conflict between Dany and Jon which was emphasized by heavily parallels drawn between the Night King and Daenerys while also presenting an interesting parallel between Jon Snow and Jaime Lannister.  

This is another show-focused analysis but I think it pertains to the overall projection of Dany standing more as one half of an existential crisis facing characters in the middle like Jon Snow and Jaime Lannister.  

I'm ready to expand on both of those theories.  

Season 7 provided us maybe the most pronounced parallels between these 4 characters that further cement my belief that Jon and Dany are destined to be foils while, interestingly, Jon and Jaime are meant to be paralleled with each other as ""knights"" on opposite trajectories just as the NK and Dany are meant to be paralleled as each pole of an elemental, existential threat.  

The Loot Train Battle (7x04) (from here known as ""Field of Fire 2.0"" [Fof2.0]) was probably the most visually impressive battle we've ever seen from a television show. There were harrowing moments. We feared what might happen to a bunch of characters we care about. It was just overall a very compelling scene...but I think lost in a lot of the excitement is a very very interesting connection to the battle of Hardhome in 5x08.  

The settings were different (like Ice and Fire different), there was no overlap of the characters from either battle, and one was a clear protagonist in Jon defending against a clear antagonist in the NK while the other was a bad guy in Jaime defending against a hero in Daenerys.......or was it?  

I found these battles were shot almost EXACTLY the same with almost the EXACT narrative overlap which casts Dany in a completely different light than one half of a heroic duo. Analyzing these battles really did shock me. Even down to the timelines of the respective battles. They are both startlingly similar chronologically as well as narratively confirming the visual similarities.  

1) The setups  
(https://i.imgur.com/XUzNyFz.gif)  
We get some light-hearted moments (""I'm not good at counting"" / Dickon name jokes) which are broken by a realization of impending crisis.  

2) THE APPROACHING STORM  
(https://i.imgur.com/9o6zWiz.gif)  
This hardly even needs explaining but...Daenerys Stormborn and the Night King as the foe that doesn't wait out the storm, he brings the storm.  

3) Supporting Characters Receiving Character Expo Only to Die  
(https://i.imgur.com/1txMW80.gif)  
Karsi was introduced and killed in the same episode. Dickon was given a lot of exposition so that we liked him at the moment Dany chose to execute him along with his father.  

4) ""Heroes"" Need to Get Their Secret Weapon  
(https://i.imgur.com/kZe2p2M.gif)  
Both situations with Jaime/Bronn needing to dash for the Scorpion and Jon/Tormund/Loboda needing to dash for the Dragonglass.  

5) Visually Similar Images of the Veritable ""Dam Breaking""  
(https://i.imgur.com/JiT9MIp.gif)  
Viewers (and the ""heroes"") both realize the overwhelming force they face. The Dothraki are far too powerful and numerous for the Lannisters to defeat and the wights are so many in number that they can break down the gates.  
No amount of bravery can save either.  

6) Tracking Shots of Bronn and Jon  
(https://i.imgur.com/kNbxLrv.gif)  
I think one of the reasons the parallels can be easily missed is that 7x04 plays fast and loose with who exactly stands for which character. In this moment...Jon and Bronn are now the parallels. Given crazy similar moments while trying to make it to the secret weapon that I outlined above.  

7) Tracking Shots II  
(https://i.imgur.com/5AhsSnc.gif)  
Geez...  

8) Tracking Shots III  
(https://i.imgur.com/jMJNwPm.gif)  
Like seriously, this isn't accidental.  

9) Supporting Characters Watching Their People Slaughtered  
(https://i.imgur.com/XZw1txA.gif)  
Tyrion and Tormund watching their people being killed pretty mercilessly with almost identical looks of anguish. The interesting part is Tyrion is watching the army he should be rooting for as victors. But at what cost?  

10) Like, Even the Viciousness is Similar  
(https://i.imgur.com/NrqDBJ3.gif)  
The Dothraki and Army of the Dead shown with....an unsettling amount of similarity in their methods and killing efficiencies.  

11) Our Hero POV Characters Looking on With Helplessness  
(https://i.imgur.com/jGTzJR9.gif)  
Jon and Jaime looking on almost identically...right before Jaime's suicide ride for Drogon.  

So we have two battles. Two heroes. And two villains. At least how it's presented visually and contextually. If you ONLY saw these two episodes there would be no debating that the NK and Dany were the big villains while Jon and Jaime are the big heroes.  

The great part of GoT/ASOIAF is we have layers and layers of complication that cause us to see these as three-dimensional people and a good bit of gray in their characters. So maybe Jaime, the former villain, is still the bad guy here, just with camera tricks. Maybe Dany, while looking overwhelming, is just doling out justice for a family we've grown to hate.  

BUT..the one that really messes up that analysis is the Night King. There might be a backstory. There might not be. But we KNOW he must be defeated. And his story is the one most closely and intentionally paralleled with Dany's. That - and the humanizing of the Lannister forces in the build up to Fof2.0 - is one of the main reasons why I think this was done to both simultaneously confuse AND provide clarity to our perception of ""good"" and ""bad"" as the series comes to a close.

[SPOILERS] Can someone tell me the point behind the Wight Hunt?,"So I have been rewatching the last season and there is something I can't wrap my mind around.

By Wight Hunt I mean when Jon and his companions go beyond the wall to capture a wight and prove its' existence to Cersei.

Smart plan. If Cersei learns it then all of Westeros learns it and all of Westeros needs to accept the existence of the real enemy if they are going to survive it.

But why not just capture a criminal instead and punish him in the wall by hanging, wait for him to turn, package him up and take him to King's Landing?

If we are to assume that Jon is honorable and all that cool shit, so he would never kill someone criminal or no just to make a point, then they could just take the first wildling that fell to the dead bear and take him back. Instead of, you know, marching straight into White Walkers.

"[SPOILERS] So now that it's been a good while, what are everyone's thoughts on season 7?","Although there was a ton of discussion going on during season 7's run I think it's time we can take an unbiased look at it in reflection, this is a controversial season, and opinions are going to vary, but I'll give my take. 

I think it's the worst season they've ever done, now that isn't to say it's bad, it's quite good, and I'm not someone who necessarily thinks they've been getting worse for years (season 6 is my favorite). But I think there are a number of major issues that just push this season down to the bottom of my ranking.

1. Time restraints, I'll be the first one to admit that I fucking hate them decreasing the amount of episodes we're getting, I think it's nothing but detrimental. Seven episodes didn't help the pace, it didn't push the storyline in a better manner, it spread it thin. Characters fast traveling around usually isn't the type of thing to bother me, but here it absolutely does. This best comparison that can be made in my mind is that time restraints have turned Game of Thrones from a character driven show to a plot driven show. Character development feels like a side dish rather than the main course, wheres I felt beforehand the two were in perfect balance.

2. Stupid Shit. Like season 7 or not I think we can all admit there's a lot of stupid shit in this season, not just standard ""That doesn't quite add up"" stupid shit but next level ""How dumb do they think we are"" stupid shit. There are two particularly big offenders. The first being Jamie in the water. I don't care how many excuses anyone makes, that's just dumb. You're telling me that Jamie Lannister, wearing full plate armor and a heavy golden hand can not only be rescued from sinking into that lake. But Bronn can proceed to get his armor off and get him safety to shore that looks like is miles away. No. That's not just lazy writing that's just offensive to the viewer. Next level dumbfuckery that doesn't belong in Game of Thrones. The second offender is the entire episode Beyond the Wall. Now I like the idea of this episode a lot, and I was really hyped for it going into the episode and enjoyed watching it. It's entertaining, but it's pretty dumb. For one, there's no goddamn way they would send Jon Snow, the King of the North, maybe the most important player in this game on a suicide mission like this. Now it'd be like Jon to risk himself and try and go, but it'd also be like him to listen to reason and stay back. The very fact that Jon Snow went Beyond the Wall for this is tomfoolery. For Two, and this is a complaint that involves other episodes, it Gendry. Now I know I'm in the minority here, but I don't see any reason other than fan service for Gendry to have returned to the series. I'll admit, there's cool stuff they could do with his character, but it looks like instead of that they decided to put him in the heat of a season already pressed for time to swing his hammer a couple times. He serves no purpose to this episode or the plot at all and if they wanted to bring him back so badly they should have done it back in season 5 or 6 when they had the time to do it. Finally I want to talk about Benjen Stark, minor character, has hardly ever had any screen time, but I really like him. He's the last remnant of that generation of Starks, and he a father figure to Jon. So I think you can see why I'm upset that when he and Jon finally reunite it's for five seconds then Benjen rides to his death. Again, just dumb, lazy writing. What they should have done (and this is not my idea originally) was instead of that stupid undead polar bear fight scene that like the rest of Beyond the Wall, protected our characters with the plot armor impenetrable by Valerian steel. They should have came across Benjen riding Beyond the Wall, had a reunion, and had him join their company, even if he still died that episode that would have been so much more worthy of his character than what we got. 

Okay, I guess that wraps my two largest grips with season 7 up, again don't get me wrong I still love the show and season 7 has some amazing things. But overall I think the negatives really weight the season down. But this is a discussion so let's see what you have to say.

[Main Spoilers] Many Questions I have regarding season 8?,"•Does Tyrion still have his connections with Castle Black, We haven't heard about this since season 1.
•Does a normal Weapon temporaley knock out a wight, and they can then get revived.
•Are Any of the Remaining Memebers of Dany's Essos army going to turn up to fight for her?
•Can Arrows be made out of Dragonglass?
•If Valyrian Steel (Dragonsteel) and Dragonglass can kill White Walker can't one of The Dragons kill White Walkers?
•If the Dragonfire could kill the White Walkers, Could Jon or Dany burn down Winterfell has a last ditch move.
• How Many White Walkers Generals are there alive?
•What Is the men of Dorne up to?
•Would it make sense for Drogon to kill Viserion because Drogo killed Viserys
•Will the On Screen Castle Black men survive the Breaking of the wall.
•If there are any dragon eggs laid can they be hatched the same way as Dany's.",gameofthrones,True,1519238527,2018-02-21

[EVERYTHING] Does anyone else think Arya's presentation in S1:E1 is counterintuitive to her development as a character?,"I've recently decided to rewatch the first season of GoT, at the same time as rereading the first book of ASOIAF, and I have to say, Arya's representation in the show really bewilders me. For example, Arya's is literally introduced as a warrior already, outshooting Bran with a bow, even as he is guided by his two older brothers. For me, this scene really took away a sense of transformation in the character of Arya. 

After all, if Arya was allowed to practice shooting a bow to the point of outshooting her brother, hasn't the identity of Arya already been established? Why would her Lord father/ the rest of society look so negatively on her attempts to break gender norms, when these norms have clearly already been broken? How can Lord Eddard rationalize prohibiting her from yielding a sword when surely he was already aware of her ability with a bow?

Has this scene struck anyone else as slightly odd? In addition, can anyone else think of other examples in which Arya's journey has been weirdly contradicted like this?",gameofthrones,True,1519242537,2018-02-21

[MAIN SPOILERS] Jon Snow did lie,"In S07 in expedition beyond the wall, Jon tells Jorah: ... *Lord commander Mormont thought you never come back to westoros.* 

This is a lie. Jon knows it. Jorah knows it.

But in S07 again when he could lie ""just a bit"" to Cersei for much more important matter of dealing with NK and his army, he refuses to lie.

The difference is: the first time he lied because he thought (maybe) Jorah want to have his honor back (kind of) and the second time he didn't lie because of his own honor.

So: in GoT a character can lie if honor demands. The true meaning of ""honor"" seems complex in GoT. It is certainly a mix of selfishness, judgement of people (after you), involving promises or not, ...

Still: a lie is a lie.

What do you think about the meaning of ""honor"" in GoT?",gameofthrones,True,1519246852,2018-02-21

In season 6 in ""Blood of My Blood"" and Bran and Benjen are reunited, Bran is still basically Bran. The way he talks and the way he's trying to understand everything. I'm still just trying to understand what exactly happened between the two seasons that would completely remove Bran's personality and only have him answer as ""The Three Eyed Raven"". He seems happy to see Benjen and glad that he's alive, but his reunions with Sansa and Arya are dry and weird. As he progresses from seeing the truth about Jon and his journey with Meera through the wall and down to Winterfell, does he just turn more and more into the TER?

[EVERYTHING]: East of Westeros and the End of Game Of Thrones.,"I was thinking about the ending of Game of Thrones and wanted to share with you all my opinion to get some feedback and have a discussion.  While the books and the show is now on different paths I fully believe that the show will follow GRRM's ending, at least mostly.  With that in mind I think that the show will end with a few, perhaps 7, main characters leaving Westeros and finding new lands to try and settle.  Before you down-vote, hear me out.  

GRRM has repeatedly said that it will be a bittersweet ending, so we know it won't be fully ""the good guys win"" or ""the good guys lose"" it will subvert our expectations.  I also subscribe to the belief that the Night King and his army of wights is an allegory for global warming.  I don't think it would be nearly as powerful if they are simply defeated, no matter how heroic or how heavy the sacrifices are, as they haven't paid enough attention to them and that in my opinion would ruin the allegory and be too predictable.  I believe that instead of killing the Night King, Jon will broker a peace deal as he has already done with tremendous success with the wildlings.  While i'm not sure how this will happen specifically I believe the agreement will be that the survivors will leave Westeros, giving it to the Night King so they can fulfill what they were created for (protecting Westeros from the Andals).  If I had to guess perhaps he learns how to communicate via Sam + Brann.

I also believe that the group of people leading will be an oligarchy of seven.  Seven specifically to tie in with the religion, each of them fulfilling the roles of the seven.  If I had to guess I would say father (Jon), mother (Dany), maiden (Sansa), stranger (Arya), smith (Gendry), crone (Cersei, who will come around to protect her child), and warrior (Jaime).

While i'm positive many people will disagree with me I think this would be a really interesting and unexpected ending for the show, having 7 main characters live where you expect them all to die but they all lose their home and everything they've fought for would be very bittersweet.",gameofthrones,True,1519336663,2018-02-22

[Main Spoilers] Season 8 Casting,Hey everyone so it was confirmed today that actress Alice Nokes from the show EastEnders will be in season 8.  She was in Belfast and apparently she is playing a character named Willa.  Who does everyone think this character will be?  Alice Nokes is between 19-20 years old so my thinking is that possibly she will be either the daughter or granddaughter of a northern lord.  Perhaps her father or grandfather will try and arrange her to be married to Jon since he is not married (yes he is with Danny now but the northern lords don't know that yet).  Maybe she will be a Manderly since Jon will be landing in White Harbor upon his return to the north.  What does everyone think though?  I would love to hear what everyone thinks about who this character will be.  ,gameofthrones,True,1519341615,2018-02-22

[EVERYTHING] My Cleganebowl theory,"I know theres a lot of thoughts out there on how our two favorite fucked up brothers will reunite to fight to the death, but this is one that I haven't heard yet so I figured I'd share.

Before the army of the dead arrives at Winterfell, The Hound and Arya meet up again and head to King's Landing so Arya can cross the rest of the names off of her list. They eventually get there and The Hound and Arya confront Cersei and the Mountain, but right as they're about to fight the Night King swoops in on Viserion and starts destroying Kings Landing and killing thousands. He let his current army fight the people at Winterfell while he went for the 1 million or so people in Kings Landing to strengthen his army. It's possible Cersei dies here or isn't present and ends up escaping. Either way, she isn't really important in this part of the theory. 

So Viserion is breathing blue flames all around Kings Landing and the Mountain and Hound end up fighting anyway. The Hound tells Arya to leave and save herself so she can help the others. In the end, the Hound saves Arya and fights the Mountain while surrounded by the undead and blue flames. The Hound kills the Mountain but eventually dies from dragon fire. 

Let me know what you think of this theory. It fits in with how I see the rest of the show going. I really think that Kings Landing is going to get fucked by Viserion so the Night King can grow his army 10 times over.",gameofthrones,True,1519345367,2018-02-22

"[EVERYTHING] Season 7 is absolutely terrible, what even is this show anymore?","I know the show steadily dropped in quality ever since it started moving more and more away from the books, and a drastic change was going to happen once there was no more book material to work from. It was an inevitability - GRRM was the great storyteller, the showrunners were only ever tasked with adapting the story for the screen and writing around the most crucial parts. They don't have GRRM's creativity or ability, but I don't think anyone expected that they would end up having to continue the damn thing on their own. When a goldmine has run dry but the project isn't completed, you have to use the whatever nuggets of gold you have left wisely and make do with bog standard bronze for the rest of the task. So fair enough, the show is what it is, and had no choice but to become a creature of its own.


But *what the fuck* is season 7? I thought I'd check it out for a bit of light entertainment, but I haven't been able to suspend my disbelief once. So many, many things are so illogical and unbelievable. 


Why did Jamie run at the dragon? How did he survive a plunge into water with full armour - why was the battlefield completely clear by the time he came up for breath? What was the point in the Dornish lady takeover if they all just get killed before accomplishing anything? Whats the point in Gendry returning? Whats the point in Benjen returning? Why does Jon Snow, such a crucial political figure, make himself part of the expedition to the wilderness to capture a wight? Why did *he* have to be there and put himself in such suicidal danger when he had a perfectly capable team of expendable men to do the job for him? What kind of plan was 'capture a zombie and show it to Cersei' anyway? How did they not get overrun **in seconds** when they were surrounded at all sides - why did they use a bunch of camera shots for minutes upon minutes making it out like the horde was running at them one by one? Why did Jon not get on the dragon straight away instead of running out and fighting stragglers before falling into a hole?

The relationship between Jon Snow and Daenerys came out of absolutely nowhere. A couple of conversations about their duties and pasts, Tyrion saying ""he's in love with you"", Daenerys saying ""no he's not"" and while thinking ""ooh might he be?"" and then she saves his life and then they're together. It was sudden and forced and while it might make sense thematically (fire queen and ice king get together, song of ice and fire, yada yada) there was no convincing relationship development. Grey Worm and Missandei had more build up, screen time, chemistry and reason to be together - and that's saying something! It must have been done for fan-service, because people wanted Jon and Khaleesi to be together, or because the actors dated in real life, or just because some writer or show-runners thought it would be cool. Perhaps it happens in the books - but it would take a hell of a lot more than a few dry conversations, an explanation from Tyrion and then a deus-ex-machina wow-just-in-time! rescue scene to develop that relationship to a believable standard.

Emilia Clarke shows the same level of emotion when she arrives in Westeros, as when she rides her dragon, as when her dragon dies, as when she's burning someone alive, as when she meets Jorah, as when she says goodbye to Jorah, as when she does anything else. There is nothing in her delivery. It's constant stern-face stern-voice for everything, except for those times when she's calm and smiles a little. She over-pronounces every word and puts on a 'queenly' voice and that's the entirety of her line-delivery. She's a terrible actress. Scenes with her are unbearable. It's even more obvious when she's in a room with decent actors how incapable she is of giving a decent performance. Maybe it's the writing, or the scene direction - maybe the writing and scene direction is like it is to accommodate Clarke's lack of skill. Whatever's happening, it's awful. What should have been a momentous scene, her first arrival to Westeros, turned out to just be Clarke picking up some sand and looking a bit happy, walking a long distance to some epix music and then saying a cringe line. 

Who is this show's audience? It can't be the people who like the intricate story, because the story is no longer intricate - it's just a mishmash of average plot points, stupid plans, characters reuniting with underwhelming meetings, and fight scenes - bumbling on from one thing to the next. It can't be the people in it for the politics and intrigue - the conversations don't have good writing, there's no choice lines, the politics don't make sense, the narrative lacks complexity. It can't be the people who watch it for shock value - because nothing is particularly shocking. Oh, Jamie fell in a pond! Arya and Sansa fall out over a letter! Olenna finally confesses to poisoning Joffrey! (for the 5 or 6 people who still haven't realized that). Is it people who watch it for sex? No, there's no sex. So who is it? People who just want to see dragon CGI, zombies and Jon and Daenerys getting together?

The majority of the seasons, for all their flaws, remained entertaining. The book material was adapted well most of the time, and there were some really excellent newly created material. They handled some plots as well as they could, and did real justice to some scenes. They cut out some unnecessary fat that they couldn't really do much with (eg. Lady Stoneheart) and added in some material that was well written and fit the narrative. Many questionable scenes still managed to be exciting and interesting in their own way, while the really trash scenes were sporadic and glaringly obvious. There was a lot of guff and filler, but there was still a good amount of gold. In season 7, it's all shite.

I just had to get this off my chest, but please, if you're someone who still enjoys Game of Thrones, please explain why. Sell me on it. Does it have some merit that I've missed? Whats the deal?

Because the only reasons I can think of for someone still liking Game of Thrones are that they like it because they like dragons and zombie fights and they don't think about things making sense as long as Dany and Jon get together, and maybe they remember how good the show used to be but can't quite remember why so they just expect it's probably still good - because it's GAME OF THRONES, right!?! Winter is coming! Dracarys! Cunts!

She wasnt playing the Game of Thrones, wasn't trying to get anything, just spent time with her husband and had a son for him. It seemed like Roose actually treated her well, at least from the information we were given. She was very luckily married to a great lord despite being really fat and coming from a shitty house, and she seemed content and happy. She even made attempts to be nice to Ramsay, despite it being obvious he was a fucking psycho.

[Everything] Predicting Character deaths in the Final Season,"I'm sorry if this has already been discussed, remove it if so but I have only seen predictions on how the series is gonna play out overall. I want to focus more on what everyone predicts will happen to the characters as to who lives and dies and how that occurs. I believe all the talk about the ""bittersweet"" ending is a clear warning we are gonna be pissed about at LEAST one main character's death so I wanted to get some opinions and share mine.

*Jon/Dany- I think one of these two is for sure gonna die. My money is on Jon because I feel like Dany has been established as the main ""leader"" and Jon has been brought back from the dead for what I believe to be a very important purpose. I see this as some sort of sacrifice where Jon is killed by the NK but in doing so saves Dany from imminent death and allows another character to kill NK and wrap up the war.

*Cersei- I know many people believe Jamie will kill Cersei (I too believed this for a while and kinda still hope it happens) but I'm putting my money on a tag team of sorts where Jamie distracts Cersei in some manner (Maybe she kills him) and while she is caught up with him Tyrion kills her. I like the idea of the Lannister boys being ""Kingslayer"" and the ""Queenslayer"". 

*Hound/Brienne- One of these two, if not both, are for sure dying in my mind and I hope for redemption's sake it's the Hound trying to protect Arya/Sansa. It would be bittersweet but gratifying to see this lovable asshole lay it all on the line in the end for his one true friend and companion(I realize he kinda already did when these two fought earlier but he didn't actually die).

These are the ones I feel most confident about but I would like to hear what others have to say on these takes as well as additional demises and causes you see coming in the final season!

[EVERYTHING] The Fate of Gendry,"So today we are going to talk about the one character everyone missed Gendry. So yeah last season he was pretty much wasted, After having such an awesome return in Ep 5 of last season only for one Ep later he just talks with some of the characters and then runs off to the wall to send a message....Oh yeah and loses his Hammer, Like seriously what the hell that's literally how you treat a character that has been gone for god knows how long.....Okay I shouldn't say that as Benjen was gone longer then Gendry but you get the point he was completed Wasted last season.

To the point where some people think he will just get killed off as he was just Pointless Fan Service, Well I don't think so they would not bring back a character as important as Gendry only to kill him off (Benjen was never really that important and Osha and Rickon I think were meant to be a Shaggydog story anyways) so I don't think he was just pointless Fan Service I think he was brought back for a reason. Now what is that reason well I think that reason is that he will Forge Dragonglass and possibly Valyrian steel to help in the battle against the WW's but also I believe he will reforge his Hammer. Some people also think he will have a Bromance with Jon and while I think we will get atleast one or two more scenes between Jon and Gendry I don't think that will be Gendry's main relationship for the entirety of the season, Besides leave the Bromance stuff for Jon and Sam.

If you really think about it the more likely Main relationship he is going to have for the season is with Arya Stark. I do think we will get a reunion between the two and we could see a continuation of there friendship and we could possibly see it go further into a Romance. Now yes Arya is now the romantic type but Arya may have changed since then as she said that as a child, and if not well it is possible something could happen this season that makes her move to this mind set, Also I think it makes sense as it has been forshadowed several times, They seem like a good match, and like Jon and Dany they are somewhat similar. Some say he should be with Sansa I don't think so to be honest though I wouldn't mind the idea of Gendry having Sansa AND Arya as his wives.

I also believe once this is he will be Legitimized and made Lord of Storm's end, Or maybe he will be revealed to be the true son of Robert and Cersei.",gameofthrones,True,1519437062,2018-02-23

[EVERYTHING] Cersei's Logic.,"I was re-watching the clip of Jaime and Cersei in Season 7 Episode 7, and it absolutely showed Cersei's lack of logic. If the Night King kills all of the dragons, Cersei will have to face three undead dragons. If Daenerys and Jon do manage to survive, and Cersei absolutely refuses to parley despite Jon and Daenerys literally saving all of the living from the undead, Daenerys has a free pass to burn the Red Keep with Cersei inside.

I keep hearing this talk about ballistas, but Westerosi history has shown us during the Dance of Dragons that the Red Keep can be occupied by the mere presence of dragons, ballistas be damned. Even if Cersei and Euron do manage to put up a fight, the alliance of Jon with the North, Daenerys with the Dothraki and dragons, and Sansa with the Vale (and perhaps even the Riverlands, there is a power vacuum there that can be filled with a strong Tully claimant, now that the Freys are gone), versus Cersei and Euron, its no match, the Jon-Daenerys-Sansa alliance would win by mere numbers and resources alone.",gameofthrones,True,1519495833,2018-02-24

There's no doubt that he believes in the gods and believes that he's some sort of ""religious crusader"", but I also can't help but think that he got a tad drunk on the power. He most likely sees through Cersei's bullshit and wants to keep punishing her for it, and especially with as much power as the Sparrows were given because of her, I have a hard time imagining that he would willingly give that up if she had tried to take it naturally.

[MAIN SPOILERS] Bran falling chapter in the book.,"So I began reading the books recently and just finished the chapter on the conversation between bran and the three eyes raven during his fall.

Another was armored like the sun, Golden and beautiful. Over both of them loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.” Is this to foreshadow anything in the later books/seasons? Maybe like the mountain basically becoming a zombie for Cersei? And the hound against him? And who’s the other that’s armored like the sun?

[Everything] Catspaw and the Dagger,"During Baelish's trial, Arya says (paraphrasing) : ""You told our mother that this dagger belonged to Tyrion Lannister. That was another one of your lies. It was yours.""


Now, it seems that a lot of people take this statement to mean that Baelish never lost possession of that dagger (to Tyrion or Robert). And from that, they seem to conclude that he must have given that dagger to the catspaw, which would mean that he sent the assassin after Bran. To those who believe this, I'd like to ask how they address the following issues:


1. Why would Baelish arm the assassin with a unique dagger that belonged to him? Like Tyrion said - ""What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?"" - and he was right. This action would be too stupid for Cersei, let alone someone like Baelish. If the point was to frame the Lannisters, why not have a fancy dagger designed with a golden lion hilt? Or better yet, steal one of the Lannister daggers from the armory and give that to the catspaw. Or if owning a Lannister dagger maybe too obvious, how about one of Cersei's trinkets being found on the assassin as ""proof"" of the person who paid him? Or maybe, the bag of gold with the assassin happens to have a lion embossed on it? There are a thousand simpler ways to get the same result without Petyr ever having to lie to Catelyn - so why would he choose this risky and convoluted plan instead?


2. What was Petyr's plan for the catspaw? It was just sheer luck that summer happened to maul him to death during the assassination attempt. And that's not something Petyr could've expected to happen. A very real scenario would be that the assassin is caught before, during or after the attack and if he's caught, he'd be questioned. And he didn't seem like the type to hold out under torture. Even if he was told to blame the Lannisters, its not like he'd be killed as soon as he gives up a name. He'd be an important witness and they'd keep him alive and check and double-check every aspect of his story for inconsistencies - because blaming the Lannisters is going to be a big deal and you can be damn sure that the Starks would do their due diligence. So its really hard to see how that could've ended well for Petyr. 


3. If his plan was for the assassin to actually succeed and get away, what would the point of the dagger be then? If the assassin had killed Bran and gotten away, Cat would've never come to KL looking with the evidence and Petyr would've just given away his unique dagger to a random guy he'd never see again. 

4. The explanation of Petyr's plan is pretty convoluted. You expect us to believe that Petyr foresaw Catelyn finding the dagger, suspecting the Lannisters, traveling to KL in secret, meeting him in secret,  giving him the chance to lie about the dagger and then believing him. But there are a thousand different ways this could've gone in a different direction. Let's say Cat never gets out of her depression and stays by Bran's side. Let's say she sends Robb instead, who has no reason to trust Baelish. Let's say she makes it to the city but Varys doesn't find out about her and she ends up going to Ned first as planned. Let's say Varys does find out she is there, but informs Ned instead of Petyr. Let's say she refuses to go with Petyr's guards and insists on meeting her husband first. Let's say she does go to Petyr but keeps tight-lipped about the dagger despite Varys' prompting. Or let's say Varys happens to know who the dagger belongs to and tells Cat that he saw it in Baelish's possession a few days before the King left for Winterfell (after all, Baelish doesn't know what Varys does or doesn't know). If any of these things happen, Baelish has lost his chance to lie to Cat about the dagger and there is a huge risk that he'd be discovered as its real owner. So why do you expect Baelish never considered these possibilities? Or if he did, why did he dismiss them and take the risk anyway?


If Baelish had actually arranged for Bran's assassination attempt and planed on framing the Lannisters, this is how I'd expect him to do it - have one of his men dress up as a Lannister guard to hire the assassin. Make sure that the assassin sees the Lannister red and gold, is paid with a bag of gold with a lion embossed on it and is probably given a Lannister blade . This way, the assassin himself would believe that he was hired by the Lannisters and everything in his possession would confirm it. Then make sure to have another man in Winterfell who'd make sure that the first guy is caught before, after or during the attempt. And if necessary, make sure he dies soon after naming names. This way Baelish would've created the necessary rift between the Starks and Lannisters with minimal risk to himself and without ever having the need to lie to Catelyn. That is probably how Baelish would do it - but the way it was done seems a little too stupid to be him.

[EVERYTHING] Bran's visions and hints to parallels between tragic stories of Dany and Nightking?,"In Season 6 ""Blood of my blood"", Bran has a vision which is a mix of mostly Dany/Drogon, NightKing/Craster's son, MadKing/alchemists/explosions and scenes of dying Starks. So misery and drama all around.

I was wondering whether this may hint at Dany's dragons causing major destruction and misery without Dany really intending to do so, but simply because it's in the nature of the dragons (and because Dany changed since she has three dangerous grown-up dragons).

The Nightking is a man who was turned into this cold and monstrous creature **against his will**, and he can create the White Walkers and the army of the dead to fight for him. But fight for what goal? What's the point of turning everyone into an undead? Does the Nightking have a choice?...

And Dany (consciously or not?) transforms into the ""mother of dragons"" when her dragons are born, and, as she says **""if they are monsters, so am I""**. But Dany never **meant** to become a monster. Yet she definitely changed since the dragons were able to be used as weapons. Dany's dragons help her win her fights, but when she comes to Westeros, what is she actually fighting for? She doesn't seem to think further than winning the throne. So what's the point of winning the throne, if she doesn't like ruling? Does Dany (characterwise) have a different choice than fighting for the throne?

In S6 Ep10 when Cersei blows up the Sept, what would happen if Lancel had made it to the candle in time and put it out? Like I get that it’s a show and they added that in for suspense and drawing the viewers in, but it seems like Lancel was only slightly maimed by the child with knife. So what if he was still able to walk or at least get a hustling limp going to make it to the candle in time and blow it out? Would Cersei have been screwed cause the sparrows would come after her?

Thoros says it doesn't ""work that way"", but surely that's not a definite confirmation right? Could it be possible if they put the head right back with the body and asked the Lord of Light that he could bring someone back?

Thoughts on Robb Stark?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1519535580,2018-02-25
[EVERYTHING] A Prediction I don't think anyone has mentioned,"Okay so I have been looking around the Internet to look for Fan theories and Forshadowing videos to put my mind at Ease until S8 comes around (amongst doing other things like going out for walks and hanging out with friends), However when watching a vid on Theon being the champion of the Drowned God (which I will leave a link to at the end of the post) they person in the vid mentioned something interesting...The Idea that Theon and Sansa marry at the end (though weather they restore the Greyjoy line or the Stark line or they make there own thing called idk House GreyStark? Is unclear).

Now while I don't think this will happen I do think it would be an interesting way to go and it would make sense. For one (in the show atleast) Theon was the one who saved Sansa life in S5 from that Psycho Ramsey, Unlike SanSan THERE ACTUALLY (as far as I know I could be wrong though, If so someone correct me) THE SAME AGE, and also in the vid it mentions it would parallel a tale in Norse Mythology of which the sea god Njord is apparently destined to marry the Goddess Skaoi (though while that one would end up being Ill-fated hopefully a marriage between Sansa and Theon would be healthy and NOT Ill-fated). So basically if this theory is right Theon saves Yara only for her to die then Theon kills Euron. Which after all is done he goes to help Jon and Dany and afterwards becomes king of the Iron Islands and maybe marries Sansa.

Now while I would personally not mind this but three problems keep me from seeing it as a legitimate prediction. 1. I don't think Theon and Sansa see each other that way 2. What would really be the point? Yeah Theon would have the North support but he does not need it if he goes to help Jon anyways nor can he even Produce children (though yes I know they can just adopted or maybe if Jon and Dany die he and Sansa raise there child or maybe Sansa promises Brienne she and Theon will raise her and Jaime's child or something like that) 3. Would it really make sense since there has bene now forshadowing for it (and if it does happen they will have to put more symbolism on it early on in S8, and also have Sansa mention Theon again).

So yeah it is a interesting idea and I am surprised a lot of people aren't mentioning it but, It just seems alittle unlikely. Not to mention I think Sansa will die next season so...Yeah.

"[Everything] If you were in Cersei's position, what would your strategy be?","I think that people criticizing Cersei's strategy at the end of Season 7 don't realize that Dany is as big a threat to her as the army of the undead.  Cersei gets no credit for helping Dany and Jon defeat the Night King.  Her life is in danger as long as Dany is still alive.  So what would you advise Cersei to do to defeat Dany?

Personally, I think that she should have ordered the Lannister armies North and pretended to help but secretly ordered her men to assassinate both Dany and Jon in the middle of the battle.  That sounds like something Tywin would do.",gameofthrones,True,1519551211,2018-02-25

[EVERYTHING] The Tower of Joy,"So I am rewatching the entire series and this time just trying to get a better understanding. 

Why doesn't it cross anyone's mind that Lyanna might have been pregnant? They all assumed she was raped but when Ned brings back Jon, not one person doubts his story? Lyanna is ""taken and raped"" and Ned comes back with a baby.

Cat was too emotional and not logical so she would never think that much to question Ned. But seriously this guy went to war, slept with another woman and obviously kept her around long enough to know she was pregnant and bring the baby back. How did no one notice this? He was at war so I am sure he did not just travel alone.

How did Ned bring Jon back without raising questions? Howland Reed is injured so we know he has to take him to get help. Did he leave Jon with the maiden in the tower until he returned alone? 

Did Ned ever mention how Lyanna died?

In A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords dragonglass is said to be traded as a valuable commodity, used in sword hilts, rings, eyepatches, and elaborate arches with obsidian flakes. 

So, my question, is why didn't Stannis (who apparently had cliffs, boulders, and ledges of the stuff) not hire artisans, jewelers, and skilled craftsmen to work the obsidian into valued pieces of ceremonial or practical use (it IS stated to be sharper than steel) and sell them for a profit in Westeros, or even Essos. Stannis could've become extremely rich doing this.

[MAIN SPOILERS] King Robert’s after life,"I started reading the books, can’t stop wondering what would King Robert do in the afterlife when he sees Lyanna and Rhaegar. 

Update: 
why I’m thinking about the afterlife, I think the old religion of faceless gods did believe there is one, because there were references about the afterlife and they were all around the Starks. 
in the book the Winterfell lords had their swords cross their lap to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts, so Ned was wondering if the other northern kings are ghosts roaming the castle, because their swords have vanished with time. 
And when King Robert was on his deathbed, Robert told Ned “I will give Lyanna your love, Ned”. 
Plus Ned wished the Gods would tell Robert the truth about Joffrey, so he won’t think Ned betrayed him by disinheriting his sons.

[EVERYTHING] Identity of the Smiling Knight?,"Who do you guys think the Smiling Knight is?

I've been playing around with the idea that it's Stannis, because I thought of him when I heard this quote by Ned in the Season 6 Histories &amp; Lore voiceover:

&gt; One of their leaders, the Smiling Knight, was a madman. Cruelty and honor jumbled together. But he didn't know fear. 

I thought of Stannis for a few reasons. First, ""cruelty and honor jumbled together"" sounds like him, the guy who both knighted and chopped off the fingers of Davos for being both a hero and a smuggler during the rebellion. 

Second, Stannis either had no fear or persevered through it when shit got real. Starting as far back as the siege and continuing all the way to the battle for Winterfell when all the odds were against him, even accepting his execution with a brave face. 

Third, the running joke throughout the series is that Stannis never smiles; maybe the nickname is meant to be sarcastic, similar to ""Brienne the Beauty""? 

Last but not least, the Kingswood Brotherhood was considered by the smallfolk to be the only ones protecting their rights. Stannis isn't exactly an angel, but this quote from the books came to mind:

&gt; Few of the birds Maester Aemon had returned as of yet. One found Stannis, though. One found Dragonstone, and a king who still cared.

It's said that the Smiling Knight was killed by Arthur Dayne, but this whole part of the backstory is so vague (to me, at least) that I haven't completely discounted this possibility. I also very strongly believe that we don't yet know everything there is to know about the Mannis.

&gt; I'm not so easily killed, men have been trying for years.

What do you think? Did I miss something in the series (show or books) that makes this impossible?

[EVERYTHING] What is (in your opinion) a valid criticism that you've seen defended as if it meant the end of the world?,"So it's pretty common among book readers, but I consider A Feast For Crows (the 4th book, for those that haven't read them) to be the weakest of the five novels. The first three are so tightly written and focused, and Martin really started meandering in books 4 and 5, and due to that they feel very bloated.

But I have been torn apart more than once for saying _anything_ negative about this universe, and ""how dare I insult the brilliance of GRRM"", etc etc. I'm not pretending that I could ever so what he's done, because I can't. But I don't think that anyone can honestly say that book 4 is an improvement on what's come before it. I still love this world, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have room to improve.

Not to mention her husband openly humiliating her in favour of Lyanna Stark. (That being said, I know what happened to Lyanna was horrible as well.) I could relate to Oberyn wanting to get revenge for his sister. 

It feels like most people outside of Dorne have forgotten about Elia, or choose to ignore her. To some extent, I guess this extends to the fandom as well, but I'm not picky with that since each person is different. 

If there is a part of her story I missed, or an event I misinterpreted, please do call me out.

"[MAIN SPOILERS] My Predictions for Season 8, The Final Season","Okay so these are my predictions for GOT season 8, The final Season. I hope you like them enjoy:

- Jon and Dany arrive at WF and while Jon gets a warm welcome from the stark children the Northern lords are not please to meet him upon the news of him bending the knee, Sansa and Arya surprisingly are not too happy with him bending the knee and Arya even poisons Varys remembering him back in KL and suspecting he would betray J&amp;D.

- Jaime convinces atleast half of the Lannister army and Edmure and the Riverlands forces to join him and Bronn in the fight against the dead. They arrive and help Jon and Dany in the battle, But there combined forces are still no match and they fallback, The battle results in the deaths of Grey Worm, Jorah, Tormund, Ghost, Edmure, and most of the Northern Lords but Bran trapped at the Weirwood in WF has Dragonglass put into his chest being turned into a WW.

- Cersei has her miscarriage, Euron arrives with the GC but Euron attacks the city as Cersei, Qyburn, and the Mountain with some Lannister forces escape through the secret entrance and head to take Storm's end. Euron then takes the Iron throne and declares himself king of the Seven Kingdoms and sends Harry with the GC to deal with Jon's forces and bring Dany to him.

- Dany is revealed to be Pregnant, Bran and Sam prior to the first battle in WF decide to wait and tell him about his parentage later as he needs to focus on the battle, Afterwards Sam does tell Jon about his true Parentage.

- Sansa is killed sacrificing herself to allowing Arya escape from certain danger (this danger is either WW related or GC related) Making Arya the last Stark until Beric brings Sansa back with the last kiss, Mel arrives in old lady form suggesting they kill Dany to make the weapon Jon is disgusted by this and has Mel executed.

- Arya puts an end to Cersei only for her to be Resurrected by the NK, Jaime then kills the Undead Cersei and forges Lightbringer, It is revealed the NK is a Proto-Stark as Euron and Theon fight in KL, Theon kills Euron with help from Jaime but Theon dies in the process saving Yara. 

- the final battle takes place in the Trident paralleling Robert's Rebellion with Jon on Rhaegal and NK on Viserion. Dany was sent to Dragonstone where it would be safer but Dany survives childbirth and as Rhaegal dies and Jon falls with him (surviving the fall though), Dany on Drogon comes in on the last minute and kills the undead Viserion but Drogon is wounded in the process, NK survives and Jon sadly knows what he has to do he plunges Longclaw into her heart and forges Lightbringer as he fights the NK one on one he over powers him but Arya comes from behind and stabs the NK in the back allowing Jon to get the finishing blow.

- Jaime with Sam rides to the God's eye to find Bran as a WW, Meanwhile none of the Wights collapse and as Rhaegal raises from the dead and is about to burn Arya, Jon, and Drogon Jaime plunges Lightbringer into Bran's heart and undead Rhaegal and all the Wights collapse and the WW's break apart and Jaime sercomes to his wounds from Euron and Drogon also sercomes to his wounds and dies as well.

- Brienne dies during childbirth to Jaime's child, Kingdom wide rebuilding is held as the Kingdom is turned into a Proto-Democratic one with Bronn getting his castle in Highgarden and becoming Lord of the Reach, Yara getting the Iron Islands, New houses getting Stormlands, Riverlands, and the Vale (Robin died in a ""Accident"" Involving the moondoor), Tyrion gets Casterly Rock, and Jon becomes King of the Seven Kingdoms NOT because he wants to but because it is his duty.

- He also Marries Sansa NOT because he wants to or because he loves Sansa that way but so that he can have the North truly in his support and also his child with Dany can have somewhat of a Mother with Sansa willingly agreeing to marry him so his child with Dany can have a Mother, Arya becomes Queen in the North/Lady of Winterfell NOT because she wants it but because there must always be a Stark in WF. Gendry also chooses to be with Arya and marries her taking the Stark name with the two raising Jaime and Brienne's child.

- Sandor survives Cleganebowl and decides to become Sansa Royal protector, Davos is made hand, Sam is made Jon's Maester, and the Bittersweet ending is that Jon defeated the WW's but lost another love, Married a woman he doesn't even love in that way, and raises his child without the true born Mother. Also Magic Disappears and yes after Euron is defeated Harry changes sides.

- Qyburn is never heard from again, He is Presumed dead.",gameofthrones,True,1519693778,2018-02-26
"[S7E6] A new ability revealed in ""Beyond the Wall""?","The Night King seems to have some sort of telekinesis or other magic ability involving ice or maybe just the ice weapons the Walkers make. The 2nd spear he throws curves almost 90° to hit it's target, which assuming he can control the spear, wasn't Drogon since he could've easily hit him. I'm assuming he was aiming for Dany thinking she's the last Targaryen and the other dragons would leave with her dead, but maybe he knows something about one of the other passengers or maybe he was trying to scare them away?

"[EVERYTHING] Extreme weather, CotF, White-walkers and nature magic theory (mix of books and show info)","S6E05 via Bran/3ER weirwood vision, we see the CotF appear to create an Other/WW, by thrusting dragonglass into the heart of a First Man tied to a Weirwood Tree, surrounded by megaliths in some freaky ritual. 

In the vision, the area is NOT in winter. It's green and lush. We also see the same Weirwood tree in the present day but this time, in winter. And know that the location of this tree is beyond the wall, in the Land of Always Winter. 

So this scene tells us that the Land of Always Winter was not always winter (contrary to its name).

I would guess that the ritual we witness via Bran is occurring over 10,000 years ago, during the time that the CotF and First Men were still at a war. Leaf says that they created the Others/WW to defend the CotF against men. However, the very name ""Land of Always Winter"" suggests that the First Men have no memory of the area (now beyond The Wall), ever being in anything but deep winter. 

So I postulate that; 

*During the war between CotF and the First Men far North Westeros was NOT cold or in winter, possibly there was not even such a thing as winter at all

*Sometime shortly after the CotF created the 1st Other... that area descended into winter and remained in winter from then on (or at least throughout the word of mouth history of Westeros and as recorded in place name). This could have happened fairly quickly, or taken 100's of years. Timescales are unreliable in GRRM world so I wouldn't want to state anything definitive. It's entirely possible that the First Men didn't reach the far north of Westeros for a long time after their migrations began.

So the theory i'd like to explore is; 

Was the ritual that created the white walkers some kind of nature_magic_abomination that caused some seriously f*cked up issues with nature and weather? Did the creation of the Whitewalkers ultimately create the messed up climate change issues and occasional extreme winters like the Long Night? 

Maybe the CotF broke some pact with the Old Gods? Or maybe there are inherent laws within the balance of the world that were violated by the CotF? 

I'm a book fan, but watch the show even more avidly now that is has surpassed the book timeline. Obviously there are aspects of the show that have been changed and don't represent GRRM's story, however, I doubt the show would change such a major plot point as the creation of the WW/Others, and go to the trouble of showing the scene in summer and winter very explicitly unless it was relevant overall. 

For book fans; 

In terms of book cannon, the only mention of the cause for the Long Night mentioned is kinslaying....the Bloodstone Emperor murders his sister to steel the throne of the Empire of the Dawn in the far east of Essos, this affronts two Gods who unleash their wrath in the form of the Long Night. 

As far as we know, the Long Night is experienced across Westeros and Essos at the same time and it's a global phenomenon. However, the winter stuff seems to be more specific to Westeros. 

In the books Melisandre describes The Wall as one of the ""hinges of the world"" referring to places of significance magically. She also thinks about how her magic is stronger at the Wall than even at Asshai. A lot of other people believe that The Shadow and Asshai are important magical geographic location and likely date to the Empire of the Dawn.

Was it two nature_magic_abomination acts near two opposite ""hinges of the world"", power spots that triggered the Long Night and subsequent equal/opposite reaction of messed up weather patterns across the globe? Was the Bloodstone Emporer act a fire abomination and the CotF/Other act an Ice abomination? Certainly we are told that rivers have dried up across Essos and the climate issues there seem to be fire/heat related (volcanoes, droughts etc). ",gameofthrones,True,1519706655,2018-02-26

Stark - The brave arrogant jocks who care about doing the right thing and fighting evil.

Bolton - The house that everyone despises and thinks are evil. Bolton students are generally nasty and sadistic and are arch rivals to the Starks.

Targaryen - The laid back and exotic kids who don't care about issues and just want to be left alone in peace, they are generally amazing at Quidditch. Most of them are kind and passionate and dislike being controlled.

Tyrell - The kids who are quiet and intelligent, they enjoy reading or playing music. Tyrell students love learning and are serious when it comes to academics.",gameofthrones,True,1519732903,2018-02-27

- Theon will become the king of The Iron Islands (Aeron loves to say that No godless man may sit the Seastone chair, and Theon roughly means God in greek )
- Jaime is Azor Ahai, Cersei the lion, Brienne the Nissa Nissa
- Tyrion will betray Daenerys (in the show we had that dumb scene that was cut away before its end with Tyrion and Cersei, therefore a betrayal is the only thing they could have discussed. Remember we also saw a sad tyrion during the aftermath of Loot Train Attack (seriously D&amp;D learn names). idk about the books here, but it seems like he wants to capture Casterly Rock with the Second Sons and sees Daenerys as just a fun way to burn his family)

In the first few seasons/books, I don't mind the Greyjoys too much but once we move past season 4/book 3, I find everything with them to be incredibly dull and uninteresting. Luckily, the show actually trimmed a lot of that. And I don't think that Dorne really needs any explanation - especially with the show. It was bad enough in the books, but the show actually managed to make it even worse. Although I did really like the scene with Myrcella and Jaime right before she died.

[EVERYTHING] The Fate of Bran Stark,"Okay so since I did a post on the fate of Arya Stark https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7j8v61/everything_the_fate_of_arya_stark/
And one for Sansa https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7r3o4p/everything_theoriespredictions_on_sansa_stark/

It only makes sense I do one for the third surviving Stark child Bran Stark. Now a lot of people don't like Bran or his story, But (and this will be a shock) I actually like Bran as a character and I like his story, I thought I was interesting seeing him grow and seeing him go on this Journey to find this Three Eyed Raven (Or Three Eyed Crow or BloodRaven or whatever he calls himself) to walk again only to find out he will never walk again he will fly. But there is more to that as Bran's Journey is actually very important, Because if he is important as Jojen and 3ER say he is then that means his endgame and fate are very important.

Like Sansa and Unlike Arya, Bran's arc is really easier to pinpoint as well but let's look at the options:

1. He dies- Okay so a lot of people think he will be the Stark that dies, But to be honest I don't think he will because for one what would be the point of having him go on his Journey and secondly it would not fit with my theory of Bastards, Cripples, and Broken Things ruling the Seven Kingdoms. So I think Bran will live but if he does die it will be at the hands of NK most likely at WF.

2. He connects himself to a Weirwood tree just as the 3ER did- Okay so another way his endgame could take him is history repeating itself, and Bran hooks himself up to a Weirwood growing old just as the Three Eyed Raven did long ago, Now idk if this will happen exactly like this but it would be really cool if history repeated itself.

3. He becomes a Villain- Now one theory I heard is that 3ER is actually evil, and that he is using Bran and turning Bran into a dark person. The theory also goes further to say he is helping the WW's but for the show atleast that is not true but this could have some weight to it and it relates to the theory that GOT takes some inspiration from Ragnarok and maybe the Bittersweet ending, Though I don't think it'll happen atleast for the show this may be a book only thing (though I heard somewhere for the show he could be simply turned into a WW).

4. He Wargs into a Raven- Now one thing that could happen is Bran dies but Wargs into a Crow or Raven and lives the rest of the days in the birds body. Now if this happens it would be fantastic for one it fits with what he has become, It fits with the words of 3ER ""You will never walk again. You will fly"" and also imagine Bran living the rest of his days as a Crow seeing the world's beauty from a Birds eye view, That would be beautiful. Only problem is that it means he has to die

5. King in the North- Bran becomes King in the North, Need I say more.

6. Sigh.....He becomes the Night King- Now this is my least Favorite outcome and that is Bran becomes the NK, The theory goes is that at some point Bran is going to decide he needs to go back in time and try to stop the WW's and change the Present for the Better. He first starts by going back to the times of the Mad King and whispers into his heart Build the Wall or something only for it not to translate and the Mad King starts screaming ""Burn them All"", Then goes back and tries to Warg Bran the Builder only to build the wall (which apparently is considered a failure), then finally he goes further back and Wargs into one of the First men and tries to tell the Children of the Forest about the future, They don't believe him of course and they gag him and strapped him to a tree putting a Dragonglass Dagger into his chest, Bran tries to get out but he was in there for too long and he gets stuck in the man's body as he is turned into the first WW aka the NK. Okay so this theory is really just stupid and I hope it does not come true, I don't even think I have to say why it's dumb.

EDIT: oh gosh I forgot to add a other idea.

7. Bran is the one who saves everyone- now bran has been told allot that he is important or he will save everyone. What if he is the true hero and what if he is even possibly Azor Ahai. I think this is very possible and I would absolutely love it if this was the case.",gameofthrones,True,1519770363,2018-02-27

Dany is the Mother of Dragons and the slaves called her ""Nissa"" so she has the title twice. Or maybe just the slaves' title and a possible son of Jon may make her ""Nissa Nissa"" and that's why it seems which of her lovers kill her will wield the Lightbringer and become Azor Ahai. the most probable candidates are Jon or Jorah then. She would sacrifice herself and let one of those to kill her in order to complete the Lightbringer for the future of the manking against the White Walkers.

[EVERYTHING] [SPOILERS] who really is azor ahai?,,gameofthrones,True,1519837342,2018-02-28
[Main Spoilers] Varys and Ned's Plan?,"In the very last Eddard chapter, we see Ned in the Black Cells where he first hallucinates Robert berating him for his pride and honor. Some time later, Varys visits him in the guise of a gaoler and they have a long chat about current events. Couple of things of note here - Ned asks Varys if he'd deliver a message for him and Varys replies ""Sure, if its in my interest"". Varys refuses to help Ned escape and makes the case that Ned either confesses his treason or Sansa is killed. 


Some time later, an unknown man approaches Yoren with a boy for him and a purse of coin and tells him to stick around because Lord Stark would be headed to the Wall soon. And the next we see Ned, he makes his confession and is beheaded. Yoren then heads to the Wall with 3 recruits of note - Arya, Gendry and Jaqen H'qar. 



Now, the straightforward interpretation of these events sounds pretty reasonable. Varys was trying to postpone the war. He managed to persuade Ned with the threat to Sansa. Cersei had every intention of sending Ned to the Wall and if Joffrey hadn't mucked it up, Ned would've headed out with Yoren. 


But there are a few details that don't sit right with me. 

1. Contrary to popular opinion, Ned isn't stupid. He understands the game better than most people realize and he'd understand that Sansa is a valuable hostage. And if she is killed, Cersei wouldn't have any leverage left over Ned. The smarter choice for Ned probably would've been to stay imprisoned and let the war develop a little more. 

2. Varys wasn't there in an official capacity. He visited Ned as a gaoler - which means he wasn't relaying Cersei's message, he was telling Ned that this is what she would do. Shouldn't Ned have waited for an official threat to be made before capitulating?

3. The message Ned wanted to give Varys - we have no idea who it was for and what its contents would've been. 

4. The idea was that Cersei would trust Ned to accept Joffrey's judgement because he was a man of honor. The problem is, once Ned confesses, both of his options are dishonorable. Either he keeps quiet about a bastard being king or he breaks his word. So Ned's honor itself wouldn't guarantee Ned's silence once he is out of Cersei's reach - and Cersei would know this. So its unlikely that she'd acutally send him to the Wall - atleast not until the war was over. So why would there be a man of Night's Watch ready to take Ned as soon as the sentence was passed?

5. Varys asked Ned to confess his treason, proclaim Joffrey as the true king, denounce Stannis and Renly and command Robb to lay down his arms. In his confession, Ned only did the first two. While the others could be taken as implied - I don't think Cersei would've carried out the sentence until after Robb had actually surrendered to Tywin. 

6. Normally, politically significant people are taken to the Wall by sea. Less chance of them escaping or dying en route that way. This would've been especially true for Ned - rather than being sent through a war-torn territory, a large swathe of which was controlled by the Starks, sending Ned by the sea would make more sense. If so, why would he be handed over to Yoren, who was traveling by the road. 

7. Someone must have paid Yoren to take Gendry. And its not like Varys to take such actions on his own. My guess is, it was Ned's request.


None of these issues is anything significant on its own. But taken together, they seem to imply that there was a lot more to Ned and Varys' chat than we know about. That they thought of a plan to facilitate Ned's escape with, probably, Ned's support for the Targaryen restoration in the future. But for the life of me, I can't figure out the details of this plan. 


The idea of Ned heading towards the Wall, only to escape mid-way and join his army sounds fine - but how was Varys planning on making Cersei agree to it? Letting Ned head to the Wall immediately and by road, no less, would've been pretty stupid even for her. Was Varys hoping that as soon as the sentence is passed, Yoren would come up to the stage and offer to take Ned there and then? And that since it was such a public spectacle, Cersei wouldn't dare refuse? That plan seems way too weak for someone like Varys. 


And what was the point of making sure that Gendry and Ned end up in the same group? For Gendry's safety, he should've been kept as far from Cersei as possible - so why make Yoren (and by extension, Gendry) wait for Ned to be ready to go? 


And what role, if any, did J'aqen play in all this? 


Anyone got any ideas?",gameofthrones,True,1519837394,2018-02-28

[Main Spoilers] Unnecessary Wars/Bloodshed,"Not sure if this has been discussed exactly, but I've seen comments throughout the sub for a while now about how so many wars were caused by Rhaegar and Lyanna's elopement. We know Rhaegar knew about the prophecy, but how much did he know exactly? Obviously if he knew the world was gonna end then having that baby supersedes everything. But could he have gone about it in a formal way? We know the Starks despite their good intentions are rash and impulsive (Ned's brothers demanding Rhaegar's head without knowing the truth, Ned starting a war with Robert). Would they have let Lyanna marry Rhaegar despite being betrothed to Robert? Probably not, and Rhaegar probably knew that so that's why he didn't bother to tell anyone, time was running out, he had to act or miss the chance.

So it makes you think, how much of the violence is actually necessary. People don't get always along, if it took all these people dying for Jon to be born so he can save the world then hey, it might be worth it.",gameofthrones,True,1519856680,2018-02-28

"[MAIN SPOILERS] Endgame theory - Dany's ""death pays for life""","So I was writing out a comment on another post when I suddenly thought of a possible endgame theory and immediately stopped writing to write this. I don't know how much truth there could be to this, this is just a theory that I think would be a great ending to the show.

Back in season 1, Dany was told that ""only death pays for life"" when she was trying to save Khal Drogo. I think there was a lot more significance to that than we thought, and that same idea can be applied to the endgame of the show. First of all, this theory includes a previously stated theory that since the Starks are descendants of the Night's King (the 13th Lord Commander of the NW) and the WW woman he loved, the Starks will all die when the Night King is killed based on the same principle that wights die when their WW's die. I believe this includes Jon since his mother was a Stark.

Essentially, the ""death pays for life"" applies to the endgame because Dany will win the war against the WW's and she and Tyrion will then defeat Cersei, but she will lose those she loves - Jon, Jorah, and her dragons. Only the death of all those she loves will pay for the ""life"" of the suffering people of the Seven Kingdoms that she wants to save. 

Not sure how much validity this has, but I think it would be a great ending to the show, having Dany succeed in what she has been seeking since day one, but at the expense of all she loves. The death of the Starks after the NK's death is also the perfect ""bittersweet"" ending and final wtf moment that D&amp;D have mentioned.

How would Euron even know Yara and Ellaria were traveling together? Should I be assuming that Euron just so happened to assume that Dorne and Yara&amp;company would become allies and serve Daenerys? I know from a logical standpoint that makes sense but it seems like lazy writing to me. Dorne and Highgarden only became allies with each other and Daenerys due to a meeting Varys set up. I find it very unlikely that Euron would know when Yara was traveling, to where, and with whom.

Anywho I had the idea: what if George wrote the story modeling sam as himself?  I can’t imagine it’s very much of a stretch to say that someone who grew up to be a fantasy writer never felt like an outcast or unappreciated growing up.  That led me to thinking about the finale. It’s been widely speculated that Sam is in fact the one writing the story, so wouldn’t it be cool if George himself made a cameo appearance for the final scene as old Sam telling young Sam the story of Ice and Fire?

[EVERYTHING] Confirmation about S8 scene and ending,"As I already mentioned in a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/72qhr8/everything_bran_saw_the_ending_and_showed_us_too/), in one of Bran's visions (and a S4 season trailer), you can see a dragon flying over King's Landing in the summertime. I now believe there's more proof to back up my claims. Producers talk in the S7 commentary about Cersei and the map painted on the floor of the courtyard in King's Landing. One of them says: ""Dan and David asked us to make it an **exterior location** in an upcoming episode, but I can't tell you why, but that will pay off too"". And then another line in the commentary: ""... Hence the sunlight. It used to be at least a story taller, but there was **a need to see the sky** in this coverage. **Forthcoming coverage**"". I think what we'll see is Cersei in the courtyard, planning her victory against Jon&amp;Dany, and a dragon's shadow will cover the map and shee'll look up, only to see them flying over King's Landing, just like in Bran's vision.",gameofthrones,True,1518425931,2018-02-12
[MAIN SPOILERS] Wights and the wall,"So, I'm a bit confused about the wall. When he saved Meera and Bran, Uncle Benjen made it clear he could not pass the wall. we assume this is because he is ""dead"" in some way, right?

But how come Jon &amp; Co. *can* take a wight south of the wall, before the wall falls?

It's clear from the Dragon Pit scene that the captured wight is really not suffering any sort of magical ""disease"" from being south of the wall - he is just as ""fit"" and ""active"" as he was north of the wall.

So, is this some kind of descrepency/plot hole? How do we reconcile these things?

[Everything] Which character has been let down most by D&amp;D,"I think most people will agree that there has been a considerable drop in quality since D&amp;D ran out of material from the books. So which character in your opinion got the roughest deal? My top 3 will be
Tyrion- Smartest of the Lannisters, constantly outwitted by Jaime and Cersei after landing in Westeros. Suggesting stupid idea of capturing a white walker when he should have known Cersei won’t change her mind anyway (even there she pretended to and he fell for it)

Varys- He is totally useless now. Suddenly all his informers are gone, he has no knowledge about anything, he is just there for the sake of it in the show now

Littlefinger- Outwitted by Sansa Stark and getting killed.

[MAIN SPOILERS] My theory on the next season's happenings,"* I think that Jaime will convince at least a contingent, if not the entire Lannister Army to join him in going North.
* The combined armies go north and fight the army of the dead, defeating it but at great cost.  However, the Night King and his dragon are not there.  Why?
* They flew south and destroy King's Landing, trading his army of 100,000 for the 1,000,000 in King's Landing including Cersei.  They foreshadowed it too much in the last episode.
* Euron and the Golden Company arrive at King's Landing to a trap, where they are also killed and join the Night's King army.
* Dany finds out she's pregnant
* Bran and Sam keep Jon's parentage a secret after Dany and Jon declare they are getting married, or they at least tell Jon who doesn't have a chance to tell Dany before the end.
* Jamie ends up at the end killing Cersei to fulfill the prophecy in the last battle.  He survives to become the 1000th Lord Commander and restore the wall and honor to the Night's Watch
* Bronn survives and gets The Twins when it's all over, as Tyrion is good to his word to double what he is being paid (1 castle)
* The Hound survives and stays with Tyrion, who retires as Hand of the Queen and goes back to Casterly Rock as it's Lord.  He changes the Lannister's wealth from gold to wine, as he opens his vinyard there and becomes rich by supplying the 7 Kingdoms.  Remember there's always a Clegane to help a Lannister, so The Hound goes with him.
* Cleganbowl never happens because they hate us
* Gendry survives and is legitamized by Jon/Dany 
* Bittersweat ending is that Dany gives birth to a child, maybe even twins, but dies in childbirth or shortly after.  Jon becomes King of the 7 kingdoms, but loses another love of his life and raises his children/child
* In the battles, all the dragons die.  However, in some last scene it's discovered that they laid eggs before the last battle.

I really just wanted them all in writing so if I'm right I can gloat at some point.  What do you think of what I think will happen, and do you have any to add and why?

[EVERYTHING] To what extent does Tywin really hate Tyrion?,"Tywin is ALL about the family and its legacy. He says multiple times that this is all that matters, and it seems that because of the circumstances of Tyrion's birth, in while he killed Tywin's wife (and cousin) and the nature of Tyrion's perceived monstrosity, that Tywin hates Tyrion and wants him dead.

However, is this really true?

Throughout the first few seasons, Tywin seems to flip flop between accepting and rejecting Tyrion. He never flat out says he loves him or is proud or anything, but at certain points he acknowledges Tyrion's talents and understands that Tyrion is actually a more polished mind than either of his other two children -- therefore able to contribute to the Lannister name. He allows him to be acting Hand of the King while he is away, and does acknowledge that Tyrion helped save the city. Without his defensive strategy, even the arrival of the combined Lannister-Tyrell forces may not have been enough. Tywin knows that, and rewards him by naming him Master of Coin.

Tyrion protests that he knows nothing of saving money, but Tywin seems to brush that aside. He mentions in other conversations with Cersei that the kingdom is in incredible debt to the Iron Bank, and yet he puts Tyrion in charge of the kingdom's finances? That is an unspoken but serious respect of Tyrion's brain.

Yes, he refuses to allow Tyrion to become Lord of Casterly Rock, and that is a sign of his inherent distaste for his son. However, he never really wants Tyrion dead. During the trial, he allows Cersei to manipulate everything to convict Tyrion. He does want Tyrion to be guilty, but not dead.

He's a strategic thinker, and understands that Joffrey died not because of a hatred for Lannisters, but because Joffrey was a monster. While Joffrey is literally lying dead, still warm, in the Sept of Baelor, Tywin is beginning to groom the more easily manipulated Tommen. He knows Joffrey would have brought shame to the Lannisters, and while he had no hand in his death (although I maintain that if he knew about the plot, he would have let it happen), he isn't upset that Joffrey is dead. He decides not to pursue the real perpetrators because the death, overall, was good for the Kingdom and for the Lannister family.

Instead, he uses it to his advantage. He leverages Tyrion's impending doom to force Jaime to resign from the Kingsguard and retake his position as the heir to Casterly Rock. He intends to send Tyrion to the Wall -- where he can hypothetically earn honor for the Lannisters in a small way. Tyrion would undoubtably done well there, and record books would show that wherever a Lannister went, they succeeded.

Joffrey's death and Tyrion conviction would rid him of the son he hates, give back the son he wants, allow him to gain greater control on the crown, and maintain his alliance with the Tyrells.",gameofthrones,True,1518469112,2018-02-12
[TV] Looking for a particular quote of Olenna's,"I'm looking for a quote of Olenna's, one about how women try to protect their men from themselves, but their men often end up self-destructing anyway. I believe it was in conversation with Cersei? Heck, I could be getting the whole thing wrong!

"[MAIN SPOILERS] who did you dislike at first, but has grown on you over time? Vice versa?

But back on topic.  I think an obvious answer is jaime.  He really has a big change after he is taken prisoner. 

But two that might be more controversial are Arya and jon. 

Arya was pretty exciting in the beginning when she was learning with Syrio Forel, and when she was with the recruits, but towards the end she is just a fkn murderous psychopath. Literally had a screw loose.  I just cant stand her personality.  

Jon is “honorable” to the point of being a whiny bitch. 

Another obvious one is Petyr. I kind of dug him in the beginning, kind of a cool prick. But his true colors are terrible to say the least.

[EVERYTHING] How would you like a spinoff based on...,"the rise of Valyrian freehold? 

The story of how valyrian people rose to an continental empire is very interesting. 

The valyrians were said to be simple sheep herders in ancient times. They somehow found dragons and managed to tame them. They pretty much conquered everything in essos after that. 

There are many wars involved in the story like the war with Old Ghis and the great war with Rhoynish people. It involves legendary figures like Garin the great and Queen Nymeria. 

We'll get to see Valyria in in it's peak. They had thousands of dragons, which is what most people like to see. 

The series could end with Targaryen family leaving Valyria and finally the Doom. 

I think this would be great foundation for a series on Aegon's conquest.

What is your opinion?

[Main Spoilers] Most obvious Jon and Danny Classical Allusion,"I've looked for this with both a reddit and google search and found nothing, but apologies if I'm restating. The most prominent relationship between a man and his aunt in the western canon comes to us from Wagner. In his epic 4 opera *Der Ring Des Nibelungen* cycle, one of the central relationships is between Siegfried, the grandson of Wotan king of the gods (coincidentally, Siegfried is born of the incestous relationship of his parents) and Brunnhilde, valkyrie and daughter of Wotan. And it is this aunt-nephew love which ultimately leads to the consumption of both the world and the gods by fire, and the ultimate rebirth of the world afterwards.

As Benjen was explaining to him that the brothers of the Night's Watch couldn't father any children, and Jon stated that he didn't care, Benjen replied with ""You might, if you knew what it meant."" 
Do you guys think that Benjen was just speaking of fatherhood, or was he dropping a hint that he knew about Jon's parentage, and that Jon's child would be the heir to the Iron Throne?",gameofthrones,True,1518587242,2018-02-14

[no spoilers] Why does the Nights Watch wear black?,It seems like a dumb question but the nights watch wearing black seems impractical.

[Main Spoilers] Some of my theories for next season,"Nothing special; I just want this to be here incase one of these comes true and someone says I'm lying that I predicted it. Most of these are a stretch but if they happen I need to take credit. 


John doesn't want to be a king so he makes Tormund the King of the North (who better to rule the north than a warrior from north of the wall?)

Cersie isn't going to let her army travel north to fight the walkers so Jamie kills her (fulfilling the prophecy) as he thinks she is the next ""mad king"" (and now he's also the 'queenslayer')

One of the dragons is going to be killed before the fight with the white walkers (probably not drogon because he deserves a dope battle with the dead dragon). Cersie will order it to be killed despite Jamie trying to convince her it's not the smart thing to do

Cersie's baby will be turned into a white walker. This is unlikely because a lot of people think she's lying about being pregnant but it'd be a great twist as nothing else has come of the scene where Craster's baby is turned. 

Arya's gonna be losing a fight in a forest and Nymeria will save her (cliché but cool)

Greyscale will have some link to the white walkers. Here's some stuff I wrote a while ago about that:
&gt; The people who get too infected with grey scale are sent to live in the ruins of Valeria where valerian steel was created. They mention that dragon glass is a cure to grey scale. The night king needs babies to make white walkers and he does this by touching their face. Grey scale is transferred through touch and no one knows where it originated. The first stone man was created when the night king tried to turn a living man into a walker. 

So maybe Jorah will be immune to the white walkers' ice weapons? Something along those lines...

The Mountain won't die from obviously fatal wounds because ""what's dead may never die"". This is another stretch but imagine seeing the mountain with huge gashes and hole in him mowing though a bunch of wights. That or The Hound will win Clegane Bowl but The Mountain won't die when he should. 

Sansa will marry Tyrion and the hound will chill with them (if he's alive)



Deaths: 
Cersie
Rhaegal
Drogon 
John or Daenerys (not both)
The Mountain (eventually)
Arya (hopefully not)
Brienne or Tormund (not both)
Jorah (if the whole greyscale thing is wrong)
Red woman
Euron
Reek (hopefully)",gameofthrones,True,1518614304,2018-02-14

[Everything] How I think it all ends.,"I'm going to keep this as short as possible as my mind will probably change as it always does, and since there are many clues coming out. I'm making this theory based on clues from the ""leaked scripts"", set photos, etcetera. Also some clues I've picked up on upon my re-watch. I could include everything I believe will happen, but I wont to make this as short as I can. I don't necessarily want these thing to come true but there is a good possibility for some of them if not all.
  

So here it is. People say there is no time for certain things to happen but there is plenty of time. for the great war to start right away leaves no time for anything else accept hours of aftermath. So the last season will take place over the course of 9 months in my opinion. Jon and Danny return and everyone reunites. Bran knows Danny is pregnant, and chooses to keep his parentage a secret for now along with Sam. Jamie shows up around the same time and tells them Cersie has betrayed them. Also the Northern Lords choose not to bend the knee for Danny, and they need them. Jon leaves and goes to kings landing to talk with Cersie one last time, and she arrests him. Word gets back to Danny who has discovered she's pregnant and she chooses to stay at Winterfell with Tyrion, Bran, Sansa, and the others. Jamie, Brianne, the Hound, Gendry, Arya, and Pod, travel to kinds landing to try and negotiate with Cersie one last time and free Jon.


 Sansa knows they need to north on their side to help win the war so she takes it upon herself to travel to the Veil to negotiate with the lords. She marries Robyn in order to forge a lasting alliance, but its not all bad for Sansa because he is handsome and a good warrior in recent years. It will show a good bit of traveling from Jamie's crew, which I think Brianne will continue to keep her affection for Jamie a secret but it will eat at her the whole time. I also think, this is when Arya and Gendry's romantic relationship will start to form, and I think she will train him a little along the way. first seeing Jon, and then being reunited with everyone she cares about, makes for a happier Arya. They need to fill some time in the show with some comic relief, love, and dialog, so I believe this is how it will be done. They will be attacked by a bunch of Whights, they fight them off but Pod dies. All of the traveling everyone has to do, will give the show enough time for Danny to carry for 9 months, and that I believe will be the length of the whole season as I mentioned.


 They finally arrive at kings landing, I'm not sure if Europe and the Gold company has already arrived or not. Just to be short, Jamie will kill Cersie like the prophecy, then the mountain will kill Jamie with brianne holding him as he's dying, they both will confess their love, and then he will die ""in the arms of the woman he loves"" like he said he wanted to in season 5. We think its Cersie but its really Brianne, (plot twist) meanwhile the hound and Arya will fight the mountain. The Mountain will injure the hound and Brianne will come in and kill him, defending the hound and avenging Jamie. The hound will beg Arya to kill him again to put him out of Misery and she will. But he will die with more honor and peace then he ever did. They free Jon, and Brianne, Arya, and Gendry head back to Winterfell with him. 

Soon after they leave The Gold Company and Euron show up if they aren't already there like I mentioned. The Night king also shows up with his Army they will burn and kill everyone in kings landing, the lanister army, Euron and the Gold Company, and destroy all of the structures. Winter has come and with it brings snow fall. The Night King will fly over the map room and see Cersie, and bring her back as the Night Queen. He has his army, plus her and her new army of the dead. They head to winterfell where everything will go down. Like I said to make a long story short, and obviously there is going to be so many plots to go on in the midst of all of this, but this I think it's the general idea based on what I've watched and spoilers i've pieced together.


By the time they get back to kings landing the battle will start immediately, no time for chatting, Winterfell will be the place the final battle of the series will take place. everyone is fighting. And cerise brings along wildfire along with the Night kings dragon fire. Winterfell is on fire at this point. I think Gendry will die in battle. While all of this is happening Danny is in the tower giving birth Paralleling the tower of joy. The tower bran climbed in season 1 and was in much of his dreams, and the tallest tower sansa put a candle in to be rescued. Ghost and Nymeria show up at the battle at some point. Arya will kill whight Cersie with the catspaw dagger completing her list once and for all, and John comes face to face with the Knight king. Jon is struggling with him, but right before the Night king kills Jon Brand shoots a dragon glass arrow into the the night Kings heart killing him, and every other wight in Winterfell. Possibly Arya tries to shoot him and missed this time only for Bran to finally hit the target. It could go either way really. The clues of this are layed out in the first time we see bran in season 1. He's trying to hit the target and cant, and he has a vision in season 3 ep 2 of Jon and Rob in the woods tellin him to relax his bow arm and he misses again. Arya is last seen in season 3 ep 6 practicing shooting it what looks like the same woods as brans dream. She hits the target everything but is shown another way to shoot that contradicks how she was always told. She never gets a chance to shoot that last arrow. I think the point to that scene is she will most likely try to shoot the new way and fail leaving room for Bran to finally Hit his target.  Arya and Bran shooting arrows is not done much throughout the series but that bit in the beginning was enough to give us this surprise at the end. This could also be why the dragon glass is perfect size to be made into an arrow. It would be nice to rewatch the series when its all done and see that opening scene like, wow this is how it all ends and they've shown us right here all along. I've not really seen the shooting of the arrow theory so I'll take full credit for this one.


 Jon goes up to the tower to find danny dying, and she gives a baby girl to Jon and makes him promise to take care of her. She dies, and Winterfell burns down. In the after math, everything is beginning to be rebuilt. Bron gets his castle. Tyrion will retire as lord of casterly rock. Sansa will rebuild winterfell just like she was doing in the snow at the veil, and she will rule it with brianne as her guard, along with her husband ruling the Veil if he doesn't die in battle. She got what she wanted in life but is more humbled because of everything she went through. Arya has finished her list and got her family back but after all shes seen, and the fact Gendry is dead there is nothing left for her to do so she will sail off to see whats west of westeros but somehow she is content enough to be happy traveling. Everyone will possibly see her off at sea. Bran will go to the tree and live out his years as the Three eyed Raven. Jon will rule the 7 kingdoms and live out his days making everything better. Davos will be his hand. There will be no more wall or no more Nights watch. No more dragons, no more wights, just a normal world. I think bravos will forgive all debt of the throne not sure why maybe because of Arya, and I think Jaquen controls all of Bravos and is the Many faced God/Syrio. Don't have an end game for the red witch, Jorah, Varys and Theon to comment on. They will probably all die, with Jorah dying for Danny in some way. Theon possibly dying after killing Euron. Or living out his days at the Iron Islands. The last shot we will see is Sam reading the story to little same like old nan read to Bran, and when we closes the book the series will end. 

It's just what I think as of now. My mind could change a lot and has changed a lot, but with recent spoilers, and foreshadowing, this is what I got so far. This is not how I want it to end at all. (I want Arya to be queen of the Seven kingdoms with Gendry by her side because he will be revealed to be the secret son of Cersie and Robert.) but I'm to tired at this point to go into what I want to happed for everyone. So that's all I will say. Hope it all made sense, I typed fast and didn't go back and fix my grammar",gameofthrones,True,1518617273,2018-02-14
[Main Spoilers] Kingslayer (x2)...NOT Queenslayer,"I believe Jaime will be the one to kill the Night King, and won't be the one to kill Cersei. On killing the Night King, Jaime has Widow's Wail to kill him. I found it odd that the show did not make it a point to show that he had it. The show DID make it a point to show that Arya has the Catspaw dagger, Brienne has Oathkeeper, Sam has Heartsbane, and Jon has Longclaw. People have to look closely at him during season 7 to see Widow's Wail, otherwise, it could still be believed that it was buried with Joffrey. If there is an emphasis on Valyrian steel objects because they can kill White Walkers, then why no emphasis on Widow's Wail? Now I don't know if he would kill him in one on one combat, or if he would see an opportunity and take it like he did when he tried to kill Daenerys. But if he killed the Night King he would be able to restore his honor after killing the Mad King. People might still call him ""King Slayer"" but maybe this time they would mean it as the killing the Night King and not the Mad King. But if Jaime killed Cersei, he would not restore his honor. People hated the Mad King and what he did as ruler. Jaime killing him should have been seen as a good thing but it wasn't, and he became known as Kingslayer. If he killed Cersei he would be known as a King AND Queen Slayer. The negative opinion of him would continue, and potentially be even worse because he would be killing a ruler again and this time it would be his own sister. If he does not kill her then I do not know who will, nor will I speculate who will; that is not the purpose of this post. Now I know the Valonqar, and maybe even the Azor Ahai, theory could be used as a basis for believing Jaime will kill Cersei, and it would make more sense if the Night King is killed by Jon. But I think if Jaime killed the Night King it would make for a better overall story. Also, I personally believe Jaime is the best developed character of the series. I strongly disliked him in the first few seasons. But after confessing to Brienne, finding a peaceful solution at Riverrun, and leaving Cersei to go North and fight my opinion of him has done a complete 180. From being hated by viewers and characters in the show, to being the one who saves Westeros from its greatest danger, Jaime will be redeemed and his honor will be restored. 

TLDR: It would make more sense for Jaime to kill the Night King than Cersei. Killing Cersei would only continue his King, and now Queen, Slayer moniker, but killing the Night King would restore his honor. ",gameofthrones,True,1518621721,2018-02-14

[MAIN SPOILERS] Is Tyrion really a...,"...Targaryen?  On at least three different occasions, Tywin hinted (or just flat out stated) that Tyrion is not his, not to mention Tyrion's stint as The Dragon Whisperer.  Tywin did very little to hide his disgust towards Tyrion.   Maybe part of that was because he knew he was a Targaryen, possibly even the Mad King's son.  It would also explain why Tywin wasn't the least bit concerned about Daenerys' dragons when even Mr. Don't-Waste-My-Time-With-Small-Council-Meetings Joffrey thought it was worth discussing.  Sadly, I don't have the time to immerse myself in Westeros 24/7, so I don't know if this idea has already been discussed ad nauseum or if I missed something obvious that would make it impossible.  But after watching the Doritos ad with Busta Rhymes, Missy Elliott, Morgan Freeman, and Peter Dinklage, I'm really starting to wonder if Tyrion's a Targaryen (and to the Actually Dude that's going to point this out - yes, I realize that the Doritos ad exists in a different fictional world than GoT).

[Everything] An arrow to end it all?,"I've already put this theory in my end game post a few hours ago (Feel free to check it out) but I'm taking this tid bit out for a post all on its own because everyone seems to like the idea of this and its something I haven't seen, so here it is. The final battle will take place in Winterfell. 

John comes face to face with the Knight king. Jon is struggling with him, but right before the Night king kills Jon Brand shoots a dragon glass arrow into the the night Kings heart killing him, which will then kill every other wight in Winterfell. Arya possibly tries to shoot him and missed this time only for Bran to finally hit the target. It could go either way really. The clues of this are layed out in the first time we see bran in season 1. He's trying to hit the target and cant, and he has a vision in season 3 ep 2 of Jon and Rob in the woods tellin him to relax his bow arm and he misses again. Arya is last seen in season 3 ep 6 practicing shooting in what looks like the same woods as brans dream, its certainly color graded the same. She hits the target everytime but is shown another way to shoot that contradicts how she was always told. She argues about it. She never gets a chance to shoot that last arrow to see if it worked. I think the point to that scene is she will most likely try to shoot the new way and fail leaving room for Bran to finally Hit his target. At the beginning Ned was standing on the loft looking down with Caitlyn at Bran, Then Bran is in the same spot looking down with the Three eyed Raven, then we see Sansa and Little finger looking down on Arya and Brieanne, then we see Sansa and Arya looking down talking about how Ned used to watch her shoot arrows. I believe one of them could possibly be standing there when it happens. The courtyard of Winterfell is the first thing we saw, and it will be where it all ends. Arya and Bran shooting arrows is not done much throughout the series but that bit in the beginning was enough to give us this surprise at the end. This could also be why the dragon glass is perfect size to be made into an arrow. There are probably so many other hints towards this theory if you guys want to look further into it. I just had time to show a few clues but its enough to be legit in my opinion. 

It would be nice to rewatch the series when its all done and see that opening scene like, wow this is how it all ends and they've shown us right here all along. I've not really seen the shooting of the arrow theory so I'll take full credit for this one.",gameofthrones,True,1518639195,2018-02-14
[EVERYTHING]: why I think Jon will be the ultimate hero and who will eventually sit the iron throne,"Sorry if this theory has been previously proposed, but I think Bran might use his hindsight knowledge and Greenseer/Three Eyed Raven power to turn John into a good White Walker/NK (probably saving his ""life"" again in the process a la Coldhands). Maybe he'll use obsidian AND valyrian steel to pierce his heart (in contrast to only obsidian used to create the first WW/NK in Bran's flashback)? Then, dead-John will raise an undead army of his own (using casualties from a climactic battle that he will lose as Alive King in the North), an ice dragon of his own (perhaps dead-Rheagal), and possibly even dead-Ghost to fight the evil NK/undead army. Additionally, I also think John might raise the dead kings of winter laying in rest in the crypts of Winterfell who may serve as skinny, skeletal generals in his new dead-army (complete with ancient Stark swords, armor and maybe crowns from their crypts.) Of course, he and his army will win and John will kill the NK. Perhaps, then Daenaerys will mercifully and climactically kill John with Longclaw or dragon's breath so John doesn't have to spend eternity being half un-dead and Dany will win the game of thrones! BOOM!",gameofthrones,True,1518642135,2018-02-14
[EVERYTHING] My Prediction for Euron,"So it seems like Euron is on Cersei side by bringing her the Golden Company, But I still convinced that Euron has plans for Cersei...As in betray her. Because Euron in the show like in the books is interested in Dany and her Dragons because he says so in S6. So I think Euron next season after he brings the Golden Company to Cersei at some point will betray Cersei (Weather he kills her himself on there wedding night or Jaime or Arya do it for him) and then after he betrays her will take the throne and declare himself King of the Seven Kingdoms (with Qyburn, The Mountain, and the Iron Bank changing sides immediately afterwards (changing sides to Euron if your wondering)).

I think this will happen because it is obvious Euron has a bigger plan especially with his fascination for Dragons and the fact he wants the throne. So I think he will like I said betray Cersei, Take the throne, then afterwards focus his attention on Dany and her dragons, Maybe he will even be the final conflict of the series.

[Everything] The Blackfish - The Kingmaker,"This is a predication as to what might happen in the prologue of the upcoming Winds of Winter by George RR Martin, and has no concrete evidence other than the information that George RR Martin revealed that the prologue of the novel will feature the widow of Robb Stark, Jeyne Westerling. This does not bode well for the young woman as the POV characters of GRRM’s prologues don’t generally outlive the chapter. However, just because GRRM has said that Jeyne Westerling will appear in the prologue does not mean she is the POV character. But where was Jeyne last? As readers we aren’t entirely sure and from the sample chapters of the Winds of Winter already released we can see POV characters opening in places we didn’t explain them, e.g. Theon in Stannis’ camp, Aeron as Euron’s prisoner.

I believe the prologue will follow the Blackfish and the pregnant Jeyne as they journey towards the Eyrie. At first it will seem that Jeyne is carrying Robb’s child and they fled Riverrun to protect the potential heir to the North. The POV character will reflect on how they hoped to remain at Riverrun so Jeyne could give birth and reappear into the Game of Thrones holding the heir of Robb Stark in her arms which would, in theory, rally the lords of the North and the Riverlands. However, due to the Siege of Riverrun the plan had to be altered and the Blackfish decides that the Eyrie is the safest place for them to go as it is one of the places in Westeros out of the Lannisters reach. However, all is not as it seems.

The last time we meet Jeyne (Jaime VII - A Feast for Crows) we actually meet a doppelganger or stand-in for Jeyne. Jeyne has escaped with the Blackfish, and her mother, Sybell Spicer plays along with the ruse to protect herself and her family. That is the surprise relocation of Jeyne's character like Aeron and Theon.  

We discover through the course of the chapter that Jeyne is not carrying the child of Robb Stark. Jeyne was either not pregnant at the time of his death or the child was forcibly aborted by Jeyne’s mother. But how could this be? Simple, the father of Jeyne’s unborn child is not Robb, but is the Blackfish himself. And this would not be out of character with GRRM’s writing style as he portrays a character in a certain way and over time we discover the opposite to be true, for example: Jaime or the Hound as villains in the early stages of the story and altering into fame favourites; Jon as a sullen boy to a strong, empathetic leader; or Arya as a cute tomboy to assassin. However, here we are seeing a devout bachelor on the verge of becoming a father. But why? Out of love for Jeyne? Probably not – but out of duty and loyalty. I believe the Blackfish is a sensible man and he recognises that the Northern cause needs a new king and with none at hand he decides to make his own. Then when the child is born lie about his/her age and say its Robb’s. 

However, this plot will only last until the end of the chapter with the death of Jeyne Westerling and her unborn child, and the Blackfish if he is the POV character, perhaps at the hands of the Lannisters or Freys. However, if the Blackfish survives the chapter this will lead to a crossroads in his character with one potential road continuing onto the Eyrie to enter the Sansa/ Littlefinger plot and another road calling him back to the Riverlands and perhaps the Brotherhood Without Banners.

I suppose there is some evidence to this being possible from the show, after all, GRRM decision to kill Talisa in the show seems to show that her character is not a character he intends to include in the end game and therefore he will kill her off in the first chapter of the next book.

And after the Red Wedding, the Blackfish’s plot leads to the Siege of Riverrun but without Jeyne/Talisa the Blackfish has nothing to escape Riverrun for in terms of the plot. Whereas, His character is not at a potential crossroads, he is at a dead-end and in the world of Game of Thrones and a Song of Ice and Fire that is when you end up dead….

Some of this is a mix of book + show but was thinking about Arya’s story when I came across a one-liner in the book that mentions Anguy winning the archery competition at the hands tourney when Ned is named HotK. 

So in Arya’s run so far she is trained by Syrio (Best swordsman ever), Anguy (Best archer in the 7 kingdoms), Tywin (one of the greatest chess players in the game - I know this is only in the show only but I’m blanking on who she served at Harrenhall in the books), Jaquen (infamous faceless men who are known to be deadly silent assassins) and now Brienne.

Really, there seems to be so much going on that needs some sort of resolution I fear that season 8 may feel and rushed. I imagine they will need setups and death scenes for nearly all the main characters. We need closure on, well who have we got.. Jon, Arya, Nymeria, Sansa, Bran, Sam, the Hound, the Mountain, Cersie, Jamie, Daenerys, Tyrion, Varys,  Brienne, Podrick, Jorah, Theon, Yara, Melisandre, Bronn, Missandei, Greyworm, Gendry, Tormund, Gilly, Davos, Meera, Beric, 3 dragons, several white walkers and the Night King. That is at least 5 main character's dispositions per episode. That is a character dropping every 10 minutes (20 mins if they actually do run with 2 hr episodes)
Is there even going to be time for a story between deaths? They are going to have to spend some quality time with with Bran the 3 eyed raven too.

When I think of GOT I think of all other characters, it’s amazing how Bran has had a big part in the show and yet he feels like he doesn’t belong in the show whatsoever.

I know there’s a very big part of the GOT fan base who hates the Bran storyline too so I ask, what is it about this storyline that isn’t well done? For me it’s just boring, but I don’t know if that’s the actors fault or the writers ",gameofthrones,True,1518676010,2018-02-15

[EVERYTHING] Question about Jon,"This may seem trivial, and I'm sure could have been (or is) a non-issue, but there's a small part of me that's annoyed by Jon's post-revival actions.

Season 5 Episode 10, Jon dies. 100%, stone-cold dead, his watch ends, etc. Therefore, when he's revived in Season 6, he *technically* is not longer part of the Night's Watch. This is well-established when he says he's no longer bound by his vow because he already gave his life for the Watch.

So then...when he died, if he isn't part of the Watch anymore, he's technically not Lord Commander anymore. Yet he immediately executes all the people that killed him as if he's still in power, then he just walks out. Then, all of a sudden, Dolorous Edd becomes Lord Commander when there's no election or anything.

This may just be a case of ""de jure"" versus ""de facto"" -- the idea that Jon just took advantage of being in power, backed by the Wildlings, to get revenge on his killers, and that Edd became Lord Commander because the Watch is so destitute and formalities are ignored, but for some reason this bothered me. Jon really had no right to execute those men as if he was Lord Commander, then walk directly out of Castle Black as if he's released from his vows. It's one or the other.",gameofthrones,True,1518720235,2018-02-15

[EVERYTHING] I absolutely DESPISE the solution to beating the White Walkers that was presented in season 7,"I’m new to the show and just finished season 7, but what I hate is the fact that if you kill the Night King, all the walkers themselves die too. 

Look, it makes sense, I get it, but gosh that’s just such lazy writing. I’m not going to let that ruin the show for me but it’s so stupid and such a lazy way to beat the white walkers. That’s something directly out of so many blockbuster films like The Avengers, and it’s okay there because that’s a fun popcorn romp, so is GOT but I just expected more...creativity, rather than the good ol’ trope of ‘destroy one source and the whole army dies’. It’s just a very easy solution. 

Does anyone else dislike this as much as me? It’s just that through the whole show I think we were all wondering ‘how will they beat the WW? That massive army of the dead is coming and everyone they kill becomes new recruits, how can they hope to stop that?’ It’s something that made them scary, so when they said kill the Night King and they all die it just became ‘oh so that’s how they’ll beat them, got it.’ haha.

"[Main Spoilers] In regards to ""characters teleporting."" I noticed something interesting while rewatching season one...","Episode 1x08.  We see Catelyn Stark arguing with her sister in the Eyrie.  Later that same episode we next see Catelyn arriving at Robb's war camp in the Riverlands.  Meanwhile we first see Tyrion and Bronn taken captive by the Hill Tribes, in the Vale.  Later that same episode we next see them all arriving at Tywin's camp that had to be even further away than Robb's

Did anyone make a giant stink about ""how did they get there that fast???!!!"" back then, or did we just assume the correct passage of time had gone by?

I'm sure there are other examples of this sort of thing in the first few seasons.  I wasn't looking for it, until I just happened to notice it in episode 8.  And I think it exemplifies an unfair impulse some people have to crap on Beniof and Wiesse whenever they can for anything they do that's beyond the books.  Even if it means treating things like the show cutting out travel scenes to move the story along, as if it's something they haven't been doing all along

Heck now that I think of it, wasn't the very first time we saw Jaime in Cersei in Kings Landing, at Jon Aryn's funeral?  Then later that same episode, the next time we see them is Winterfell?  I mean that was episode 1x01 for crying out loud.  It's not teleporting, it's moving things along, IMO.  I mean I guess they could throw in text on the screen, or a narrator saying things like ""3 weeks later...."" but does anyone really want that?  Plus it could never work when you have so many different storylines happening at different paces

1) Saved by Tyrion against nights watch bullies, who were pissed he humiliated them with his arms skills

2) Tricked by Ygritte and captured by Wildlings

3) Breaks oath against being with women by sleeping with Ygritte 

4) Bested by Karl in crasters keep, saved by one of crasters wives 

5) Possibly saved by Olly when Ygritte might have killed him

6) Saved by Stannis when trying to assassinate Mance Rayder

7) Killed by the nights watch and resurrected by melisandra 

8) Decides to attack Winterfell while outnumbered, saved by Littlefinger

9) Goes on suicide mission to capture a white walker, becomes surrounded. Saved by Dany and her dragons

10) Doesn't hop on dragon, gets left behind and is about to get killed by white walkers when Uncle Benjen randomly saves him

11) Ruins possible treaty talks with Cersei by saying he serves Dany. Peace talks saved by Tyrion. 

I think you all get the picture. He makes tons of bad decision and is bailed out by other characters. And this is the rightful heir to the throne?",gameofthrones,True,1518815300,2018-02-16

[MAIN SPOILERS] Cersei is Not as Smart as She Thinks She is and Potential Ending,"Going back to what Tywin said about how Cersei is not as smart as she thinks she is, I would like to see that played out in the final season.

My theory (what I think would be fun and fulfilling) is that Dany, Jon and crew are fighting the army of the dead and are about to lose and all of a sudden Euron and the Golden Company (and potentially Second Sons to see some Dario) show up and turn the tide of battle.  The living win and when questioned about it, Euron says it has something to do with a deal Tyrion made with Cersei.  We can see scheming and everyone upset with Tyrion or whatever you want here.

While they are having a feast and celebrating the victory, Euron and the Golden Company plan on having a Red Wedding type event to eliminate all of Cersei's enemies.  However, (choose one or all) never trust sell swords to keep a secret, Jamie and Tyrion knew what Tywin did, or Sansa and Arya know what happened to their family; Dany, Jon, and Crew are suspicious and when this is about to play out they take the Golden Company prisoner (or kill them) during the feast.  Part one of Cersei not being as smart as she thinks she is.

When she hears that her plan was foiled and her army taken prisoner/ defeated she goes to the Iron Bank for a loan to get even more mercenaries.  However, she is told that she has already paid off her debt in full (with the gold from Highgarden) and that they have no reason to back the losing side.  Part two of Cersei not being as smart as she thinks she is.

With her back against the wall, Cersei goes crazy and plans to blow up King's Landing and Jaimie sneaks in (with Bronn's help), confronts her, and she admits it and he kills her to prevent the destruction of King's Landing..... Again

[Main Spoilers] Question about Dawn,"Do you think it’s at all possible that Jon could end up with Dawn for the last battle? I’m rewatching Season 7, Episode 6 (again) and the scene where Jon offered to return Longclaw to Ser Jorah made me really hope that Ser Jorah will eventually end up with Longclaw, which then led me down the rabbit hole to what sword Jon would wield. I think that it would awesome if somehow Dawn was laid to rest with Lyana. Maybe Ashara asked Ned to take Dawn so that it would be given to Rhaegar’s heir (Jon) since Rhaegar and Arthur were so close? How cool would it be if Jon were to wield Dawn, the lightbringer, in the final battle with the Night King? I’m so excited for this next season. ",gameofthrones,True,1518830624,2018-02-16

"[MAIN SPOILERS] Reading the books after watching the show, Found some direwolf foreshadowing.","As the title says, I started reading the books and  noticed a line that says, “Shaggydog ran at his heels, spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close. His fur had darkened until he was black, and his eyes were green fire. Bran’s Summer came last. He was silver and smoke, with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see” (p. 236).

The Stark children obviously have many connections and similarities to their direwolves. I believe here GRRM is foreshadowing Bran’s future as the Three-eyed Raven with the line “with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see”

While that description fits simply, the description of Shaggydog really caught my eye. “His fur had darkened until he was black, and his eyes were green fire”. Assuming GRRM was using these descriptions to foreshadow the future of the Stark boys, this sounds ominous. The first thing that came to mind was an image of Rickon burnt black with wildfire (the only green fire I know). Could Rickon meet a crispy end in Wildfire? Lemme know what you guys think

Edit: I should add that, while Rickon wad killed in the Battle of the Bastards in the show, he’s still alive in the books. Thus why I’m reading into it.",gameofthrones,True,1518844992,2018-02-17

But I just started wondering: Why didn't Jon ask for assistance himself? I may have missed something while rewatching the series, but Robin is Sansa's cousin. Wouldn't the Lord of the Eyrie be a good ally for something like this? Did Sansa tell Jon not to go to them or something because of Littlefinger?",gameofthrones,True,1518884048,2018-02-17

"[Everything] For those of you who hate how a certain character is portrayed on the show, how would you change things?","Take Tyrion, for instance, who has had nothing to do on the show in the last two seasons.  I would have had Tyrion and Jaime meet earlier in Season 7 and have Dany's defeats be partially due to Tyrion trying to save his brother.  I'd also have Tyrion become more actively concerned about Dany's tyrannical tendencies and more disillusioned with her.  This will set up his betrayal in Season 8.",gameofthrones,True,1518888712,2018-02-17

"[EVERYTHING]If Jorah Mormont goes on to have children...does Lyanna Mormont have to give up her title, as The Lord of Bear Island?","Hypothetically, lets say danny wins the Game of Thrones, White Walkers defeated, and Jorah is still alive. First off, I'm assuming that Jorah would be given a seat on the small council. I guess he could also become a member of the Kings/Queen Guard, possibly even Lord Commander of The Kings/Queen Guard. It's been shown that on his own he's a tier B fighter, but when fighting for, or to protect someone he loves, he makes a tier A fighter. In this case, he is not allowed to have children. Danny could also make him one of the great lords of Westeros, but how strange would that be for bear island. I think he would turn down this offer personally. Regardless, if he ends up having children, wouldn't they have more claim over bear island?",gameofthrones,True,1518893462,2018-02-17

[EVERYTHING] Pacing for next season: What do you expect and hope for?,"I assume there will be three or four main acts in the final season: (1) people arriving/reunions at Winterfell and preparation (2) the war against the dead, (3) Cersei's death (if not wrapped into the war against the dead) and (4) finality/celebration/mourning (""bittersweet"").

How should these be divided amongst the six episodes? 

My gut reaction is 2-2-2. I could see E1 either starting or ending with the dead sacking a village north of Winterfell. But I don't know if two episodes allows enough build before major battles. At the same time I don't know that I'd *want* more than two episodes of Northern lords hemming and hawing over who is the rightful heir or Tormund making faces at Brienne while she makes faces at Jamie or a montage of dragon class mining or Sansa doing whatever it is exactly that she'll be doing.

[EVERYTHING] Their was a great scene last season that I don't see talked about enough around here.,"Last season after Dany's attack on the supply convoy, Tyrion feels immense guilt and falls into drinking his ass off again.

Vary's gives one of the best insights into his character when he approaches him. Tryion defends himself saying he can't control Dany's mind and its not his fault.

Vary's shows a part of himself rarely seen only shown when he apologises to Ned in the dungeons. He says that what the Mad King did haunts him, and no matter how many times he tries to desperately convince himself it wasn't his fault he can't. He went through this ideology under the 'Mad King' that he was just 'following orders' and its pretty clear its messed him up. 

Vary's tells Tryion that as 'Hand' of a King or a Queen its HIS job to make the ruler rule properly.  Not like he (Varys) did which was blindly following orders or how Ned did which was basically being buddies with Robert. Even  can be seen as lambasting Tyrion's previous role as Hand which was basically Tyrion getting his own back on people.

As a Hand you have to be the person who tells the King or Queen ""FUCK NO! THIS IS WHAT YOU DO!"" or ""FUCK NO! THIS IS WRONG!"", A good Hand can be the friend of the monarch but they also MUST be someone who can call them out and make them change.

Vary's is right when he says Dany can be a great ruler and he is also right when  he says Tyrion needs to show her the way and stop drinking and pretending he can do nothing.

[MAIN SPOILERS] How I think the final season will play out,"Okay so I said I would do this but now is the time I bring you all my predictions (plus I found a way to properly compact them), so without further or do this is my full predictions for how I think season 8 of Game of Thrones will play out, Enjoy.

- NK circle back around to destroy the rest of the wall (or some WW's still behind destroy it similar to how NK broke the force field around 3 Eyed Raven's cave/tree), With Beric and Tormund escaping while Edd and the Night's Watch stay and have the wall fall on them.

- Gendry had left prior to the Eastwatch destruction and reunites with Arya and we get a bounding scene between the two.

- Jon and Dany arrive and we get reunions between Jon and Sam, Ghost, Gendry, and The Stark children. As well as a Hound/Sansa reunion, Tyrion/Sansa reunion, Arya/The Hound reunion, and a Jorah/Lyanna reunion.

- Beric and Tormund arrive. Jaime, Bronn, and Edmure arrive with an Army made up of Edmure's forces and 300 or so Sellswords from the Westerlands after they helped Edmure (who had escape from the Twins) take back Riverrun, and Jaime has a reunion with Brienne while Bronn has his reunion with Pod.

- Jon starts preparations for the battle against the dead, Though the Northerners (with the exception of Bran and Howland Reed (oh he shows up by the way)) are not happy with Jon bending the knee including Sansa and even in a twist Arya whom still respects Dany and still loves Jon but does not support Jon bending the knee. Anyways they do prep well but not enough to make a solid plan by the time the WW's get near.

- Cersei has a miscarriage and goes more mad, Euron arrives with the GC and sends him with the GC to sack it for it's food supplies and sends Daario and the Second Sons (who is revealed to have betrayed Dany) to take Dragonstone, Euron gives Damphair and Yara the Forsaken treatment.

- Jon is informed that Karhold, Last Hearth, Hold of House Glover, and Bear Island are destroyed making Lyanna and Jorah the last of there kind and houses Glover, Karstark, and Umber extinct.

- Howland arrives to help Sam and Bran confirm Jon's parentage, Once Jon learns the truth he has so many mixed emotions on it, Jon tells Dany and they get into a conflict especially when it is revealed Dany's pregnant, However before it can be settled the battle begins, Bran and Howland leave to the God's eye shortly before the battle.

- The battle is brutal as it results in the deaths of Tormund, Bronn, Ghost, Grey Worm, Yohn Royce, and most of the Dothraki, Unsullied, and Northern Soldiers and Lords. Wagons containing citizens leave to Eyrie or Riverrun, Euron along with Harry Strickland and the GC surprise attack WF killing the soldiers left there to help the citizens leave and destroying any wagons that did not leave in time before they arrived and killing the people in them (including poor sweet little Robin), Dany arrives with Drogon and burns some of the GC and gets anyone still stuck in WF out of there.

- Harry Strickland notices the NK on his Ice Dragon right behind Dany and has his men fallback to Euron's dismay after they sack WF and burn it too the ground, Harry also gives Euron smack for killing the unarmed citizens, Arya saves Gendry from two WW's only for them including Beric and Jorah to be captured by the Golden Company, Varys is also captured as well.

- After Jon, Dany, and co. make it back to Riverrun they send Jaime, Brienne, Pod, and the Hound to KL to deal with Cersei and get Arya, Gendry, Jorah, and Beric back, With Jaime going to get some Clansmen from the Vale Tyrion knew.

- Meanwhile Gendry dies in his cell but Beric in secret gives him the kiss of life (harry and some GC are the first to return by the way), Arya uses his faceless men skills and she along with Gendry escape promising to Jorah and Varys they will come back for them, Arya and Gendry go into hiding in KL (they have admitted there feelings for each other at this point and have hooked up).

- Jon and Dany leave before the GC attack Riverrun in a nick of time with almost no one getting killed, Dany gives birth to twins at the Eyrie and Jon and Dany rekindle there love. 

- Arya and Gendry sneak out of the city and meet up with Jaime and co. once they arrive, Arya using her FM skills again open the front gates allowing Timett and his Clansmen to make a distraction while Jaime and the others sneak in through the sewers. Arya gets Jorah out of the black cells as promised (Varys was executed in front of the Citizens along with Damphair), Cleganebowl happens with the Hound winning but dying afterwards due to blood lose, Cersei drops the bombshell of Gendry being her true son, Arya almost kills her but at the last minute chooses Justice over Vengeance and let's Jaime take the kill.

- Harry Strickland changes sides after hearing that Gendry is the true Heir of House Baratheon, Jaime afterwards has Harry and Timett send some GC and Clansmen to help evacuate along with Arya, Gendry, Jorah, and Pod while Brienne chooses to stay with Jaime to find the wildfire. Dany rides on Drogon to KL after hearing that the NK is near.

- Dany and Drogon are killed by the NK and his Ice Dragon in the skies above KL, Jon rides to the God's eye and learns his father Rhaegar is AA/TPTWP with Jon being Lightbringer. Also the NK has return due to Jon's birth and also to end the curse the children put on them. Jon fights the NK one on one and defeats him as all the Wights collapse and the WW's are about to break apart Jon puts Dragonglass into his heart and becoming the new NK, He touches one of the Weirwoods and with help from Bran ends the curse and the WW's along with Jon turn human again.

- The wildfire goes off and Jaime, Brienne, Harry, Qyburn, the Little Birds, The Wights, Sept Unella, Rhaegal, and any citizen that did not make it out in time are consumed by it (but this happens prior to the NK's death). In the aftermath Jon with Bran leaves to live the rest of there days with the now turned human WW's, Sansa is made Queen of the North and marries Pod with Pod taking the Stark name, Timett is made Lord of the Vale, Edmure is made Lord of the Riverlands, Tyrion Lord of the Westerlands, Another Sand Snake Lady of Dorne, New houses Lords of Pyke and Stormlands, Sam and Gilly Lord and Lady of the Reach and raising Jon and Dany's twins, And Arya and Gendry are made King and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms (with Davos as hand and Jorah as Lord Commander of the City Watch) but different kings and queens as the Throne is melted down (by the wildfire) and a Proto-Democratic Government is established (or atleast hints of it).

Now for some quick notes I want to give.

- Illyn Payne along with the Brave Companions are with the GC when the attack Riverrun only to find it empty and are killed by the NK when he arrives there with his army.

- Daario on his way with the Second Sons to take Dragonstone Theon after coming back from Pyke learning of Euron's lie attacks Daario's fleet and he surrenders as the Second Sons are forced to change sides, Theon with his fleet made up of some Ironborn from the Finale, Ironborn from Pyke, and the Second Sons still waiting at Dorne attack Euron and his fleet made up of Pro-Euron Ironborn and the GC. Theon kills Euron by putting an arrow through his eye but Cersei has Balistae's laced with Wildfire fired at the ships killing most forces on both sides including Theon, Yara, and Daario (making House Greyjoy extinct).

- Mel returns to Volantis on to leave and question her deeds and believes as she is disgusted by the Red Priest and how they said that Shireen's burning was for the good when she knows it was wrong and that Stannis died anyway, She sports Rag like Ropes and Joins Bran in the God's Eye only for her along with Howland to be killed by the NK.

- Jon's twins are named Rhaegar the II and Arya the I Targaryen.

- I was going to have Sansa die but I felt that would make her arc pointless, and I was going to have Jon sit the throne but I feel he and Dany are too obvious.",gameofthrones,True,1518929014,2018-02-17
[EVERYTHING] Season 8 Release Date Prediction,"Season|End of Production|Release Date|Time In Between
:--|:--|:--|:--
4|Nov. 2013|April 2014|~3.5 months
5|Dec. 2014|April 2015|~3.5 months 
6|Dec. 2015|April 2016|~4 months
7|Feb. 2017|July 2016|~5 months

Season 5 came out approximately a year and a week after Season 4, and Season 6 came out approximately a year and a week. 

I discounted the production schedules of the earlier seasons because I thought it wouldn't be as pertinent, given how the scale of the show has grown exponentially since the end of season 3. Production for season 8 is slated to end in July, and HBO has confirmed that the series will be released in 2019. Given the pattern we have seen above, I predict that it will be released sometime in February 2019.

This timing, also, would probably fit with the themes of the show. We all know that G.R.R.M's second to last book in the series is called ""The Winds of Winter"" and the final book is called ""A Dream of Spring."" As of now, Spring 2019 officially begins around 3/20/2019. So, given that we have six episodes in season 9, tracking back from that date, I believe that the Season 8 Premiere will be either on 2/10/2019 or 2/17/2019, and will end either on 3/17/2019 or 3/24/2019.

This would allow the story told over the six episodes to transition from ""winter"" into ""spring"", the events in the story mirroring the weather transition for much of the world. (sorry, Australia)

"[EVERYTHING] Regarding Roose, Tywin, and Robb","This may be an unpopular opinion, but Roose Bolton, Tywin Lannister, and Robb Stark were probably my three favorite characters. Both Roose and Tywin where ruthless and calculated in their actions and often worked solely for the benefit of their houses which is fairly admirable. However, Roose trusted Ramsay too much which ended badly for Roose. Robb on the other hand, allowed love and honor to get the better of him, yet his honor and cause make him extremely likable, not to mention his natural ability for command.

[Everything] My season 8 theory,"OK, spoilers for everything, I just thought this up, it's pure speculation, but I really feel it would make a lot of things work.

Sam gets back to Winterfell. The White Walkers besiege Winterfell. Since the Starks in Winterfell don't know how to defeat the White Walkers, they get Bran to look back through time to the last time they were defeated. 

Bran looks back to the first battle of the Night's King, where winter fell. He sees his ancestors use the Horn of Winter as a weapon somehow. Bran describes the horn to Sam, who says ""funny you should mention that"", and pulls out the Horn of Winter from his rucksack, explaining that he found it with the dragon glass at the Fist of the First Men, but that it was broken. So Bran goes back through time again to see how it was broken. 

Bran sees Bran the Breaker go to destroy the Horn of Winter, and wargs into him to stop him, but fails to and the horn is still broken. While this is going on in the past, the Battle for Winterfell is going on in the present. The Night King in the present somehow severs Bran's link to the Weirwood tree, and Bran's consciousness is stuck back in Bran the Breaker's body permanently. In the past, Bran the Breaker then becomes Bran the Builder, founder of House Stark. 

Bran builds Winterfell, the Wall, and everything else knowing that they'll need them to defend against the White Walkers in thousands of years. He is the origin of the Stark words: Winter is Coming. He has kids, he goes around raising Castles and learning what he can from the Children of the Forest, as they are still alive back then. He buries the Horn of Winter and some dragon glass at the Fist of he First Men. 

Bran the Builder has a falling out with the Children of the Forest, goes to war with them, and they kidnap his eldest son and use him to create a weapon to use against him... the Night King!

Bran the Builder works out how to pass his consciousness on through memory in the Weirwood trees, teaches one of his sons or grandson's how to do it, and then eventually dies after spending years at the base of a Weirwood tree, letting it grow into him like the last Three-eyed Raven did. The tree grows over him and he becomes a face on the tree. His son or grandson or who he taught how to do it taps into the Weirwood, has access to his Bran's memories through the trees (among everything else), and becomes the first Three-eyed Raven.

[Everything] Why Ned never fights in tournaments...,"When Ned is talking with Jamie, Jamie asks why he never fights in tournaments. Ned responds that when he fights a man for real he doesn't want them to know what's coming from having seen him fight before. This sounds reasonable, but I just thought of a different reason that is likely the real one...

He knows that, if everyone sees him fight, some will realize that there is no way he would have beaten Arthur Dayne. At this point Ned defeating Dayne is basically a legend, particularly in the North. Everyone knows what an incredible swordsman Dayne was. While Ned is good, he I nowhere near the same skill level of Arthur Dayne. Bran says this himself while watching the two fight... If Ned were to fight in a tournament it would get people questioning how he beat Arthur Dayne in the first place. This would get them thinking about the Tower of Joy, which is the last thing Ned wants to be on people's minds...

Anyway, I just thought of this and realized that it is likely the true reason behind Ned avoiding tournaments.",gameofthrones,True,1518991439,2018-02-18

[EVERYTHING] Something I noticed while watching the History and Lore videos for the first time,"Hello, sweet summer children! Long time Game of Thrones fan and mostly lurker on this sub here. I have been watching a lot of videos on YouTube about theories, Season 8 production news, and other things lately to get me through this Long Night until 2019. Having seen a ton of clips used in these videos from the History and Lore videos that come with the physical copies on each season, I decided to watch them all first hand, starting from season 1 onward. The second clip I watched is talking about the children of the forest, the pact between the children and the first men, the Andal invasion, etc. when [this image](https://imgur.com/ol0TP0N) of Bran the Builder came up. I know a lot of people don't think the theory of Bran the Builder actually being the Bran Stark we know is true, but the image really stuck out to me because it looks like he's in a chair similar to the one that Bran got in season 7 once he returned to Winterfell, except it is being covered up by his massive cloak. It's either that or at least something like it because he is being carried in the image I linked above. I just wanted to point it out, as I haven't seen anyone discuss this before. Sorry if it has been discussed before, I just wanted to know what you guys think and maybe spark some more discussion on the topic. Let me know what you think and I wish you good fortune in the wars (of waiting) to come!

I know that Robb suffers a big blow when he kills Karstark, because he loses some Northern supporters. But if he had continued and made a bigger impact against Tywin, would more people have rallied to his cause? 

One of my favorite things about this universes is that there are so many smaller characters that have a huge impact on the overall narrative. It's extremely intriguing to theorize how things could have gone if even small events had changed. ",gameofthrones,True,1517524982,2018-02-01

[Main Spoilers] I think this sums up Ned's fate perfectly,"I'm sure you've all seen this at some point, but I thought it summed Ned it up well and wanted to share it for anyone who hadn't, for all the ""Ned was an idiot and deserved his fate"" comments we get since, like all of A Song of Ice and Fire, the truth lies somewhere in the grey shades of tragedy.

""...In my eyes, this puts Eddard Stark in better context.  In the end, he lost the game of thrones and ended up with his head on a spike.  But he’s hardly the only one, and many great lords who were far better politicians and courtiers than he was ended up dead. 

Which I think is something that people fail to comprehend about George R.R. Martin’s work – he’s not an advocate of Machiavellian statecraft.  Ned Stark does the honorable thing and loses, but master schemers like Tywin or Tyrion wind up betrayed and either murdered or attempted-murdered and exiled, and Cersei’s more second-string efforts result in the realm being misgoverned by loyal incompetents and herself arrested for adultery, treason, and conspiracy. 

If anything, what George R.R. Martin is saying is that there are no winners in the game of thrones.  The good die unluckily, the bad die deservedly, and honest efforts and clever schemes all end in disarray."" -Race for the Iron Throne: Political and Historical Analysis of A Game of Thrones, by Steven Attewell.",gameofthrones,True,1517601669,2018-02-02

[No Spoilers] Ideal GoT Fighting Game Roster,"Hi all,

I, like some of you, have seen a [number of fake Game of Thrones fighting game screenshots](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;biw=1229&amp;bih=587&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=ZF12Ws7PBNCL5wKEmYeADQ&amp;q=game+of+thrones+fighting+game&amp;oq=game+of+thrones+fighting+game&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0.0.10402.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.H2odeCePfQg) (not really fake, but just art). So I just wanted to come up with a roster of absolutely necessary characters, slightly less necessary, and not necessary but cool characters. Wanted to see what other people think would be  cool in such a game just because...I dunno I wish there was one.

Absolutely necessary characters:

- Jon Snow

- Jaime Lannister

- Arya Stark

- Robb Stark

- The Mountain

- The Hound

- Ramsay Bolton

- Khal Drogo

- Brienne of Tarth

- Bronn

Less necessary, but would still be cool:

- Eddard Stark

- Grey Worm

- Loras Tyrell

- Joffrey Baratheon

- Robert Baratheon

- Stannis Baratheon

- Theon Greyjoy

- Jorah Mormont

- Gendry

- Oberyn Martell

- Tormund

- Beric

- Thoros

- Ygritte

- Syrio Forel

- Generic Kingsguard

- Yara Greyjoy

- Euron Greyjoy 

- Rhaegar

Not necessary but would like to see: 

Davos, Sam, Tywin, Tyrion, Greatjon Umber, Daenerys (I guess with baby dragons just flying around burning shit?), Roose, Sand Snakes (someone somewhere likes them), Jaqen H'Gar, Balon Greyjoy, maybe Viserys, the bearded dude who was on Ramsay's side in the Battle of the Bastards.

[Everything] Has the personality of the White Walkers changed over the seasons?,"*""Always the artists.""*

Love that quote. It always intrigued me about the mind of the white walkers. So much can be discussed about them. When they rearrange the dismembered limbs of their dead, are they performing a ritual or do they just have a sadistic sense of humor? Is it a taunt, warning, or some form of pass time? Why cut up people and animals when they could have added more numbers to their army?

From the opening scene of the show, we see these things toss the decapitated head of one of the rangers to the other still alive, then let him live and flee south. They want the living to know they're back and we get a snapshot of their confidence here.

Now since the beginning of the show, the WWs have been in quite a few scenes, and aside from the Night King, I really don't see anything resembling intelligence or personality from them. Though cool (heh) and confident during encounters (see Sam and Jon's scenes with them), they aren't as dark and interesting as I had seen them be in that very first opening scene.

Do you think the WWs have changed through D&amp;D's writing of them since the beginning of the series?

*Just a reminder this is a discussion on the WW, not their Wight minions.*

[Everything] Favorite and least favorite episodes?,"I have been thinking about which episode is my favorite and my least favorite and it's quite hard actually.

Edit: forgot about winds of winter, probably in my top 3 favorite episodes

Picking my least favorite episode is somewhat easier, I would probably have to pick an episode in season 7.

[S7E7] Theon's Redemption,"At first glance the scene seemed kinda silly: Theon needs the Ironborn's support to save Yara, they refuse, he fights the leader unsuccessfully until he is kicked in the groin, he laughs because he has no cock, he then wins the fight and the Ironborn's support.

But there's more to the scene. Theon's plot is a story of survival, fortitude and identity. He was violently mutilated, tortured for years and completely dehumanised as Reek, all as a result of his internal conflict with his identity as a Greyjoy raised by Starks. He suffered a lot but more importantly, he survived it all. He built up the courage to escape even though it seemed like he never would. Just like the fight scene, he was beaten to ground over and over but he came back up. I want to believe that being kicked in the groin was a reminder to himself that he has overcome MUCH worse. His identity crisis ended with Jon Snow forgiving him and telling him that he is both a Greyjoy *and* a Stark which gave him the strength he needed to try and save Yara.

The final few seconds of the scene of him washing his face in the sea seemed important for him in a few different ways. It symbolised him affirming his Ironborn culture, the death of cowardly Reek and the rebirth of Theon Greyjoy (what is dead may never die). I think the scene is really important for him because after all the horror he experienced, he learned from it, he learned that he's actually a very resilient person.

Having said all that, the Ironborn changing sides so easily just doesn't make sense to me. So, they follow Yara who has agreed to stop pillaging and raping, she gets captured, they decide to go East instead to ... pillage and rape, their leader gets punched so they agree to save her.

[MAIN SPOLERS] Some questions regarding the show.,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1517729148,2018-02-04
[MAIN SPOILERS] Some general questions regarding the show.,"I just got into GoT recently and must say its as great as the hype suggests. Season 7 felt slightly fast paced and unusual, but it sets things up nicely. I had a few general questions regarding the show, and would appreciate some answers.

1) What is the Night King's purpose? Is he gathering armies and dragons to march to King's Landing and sit on the Iron Throne? Does he want to rule Westeros or just wants to kill people?

2) The dragons are really cool and make for some epic scenes in the later scenes, but I dont understand why they are so liked. They come across as terrifying ""beasts"" and another reason is because they seem to be too powerful and anyone who has them becomes the strongest force. In a way I was happy to see the Night King get one dragon to balance things out.

3) This might be a controversial statement, but I was disappointed by the reveal that R + L = J. This is because it leads to Jon Snow being a Targaryean and not a Stark by blood. It also means that Jon Snow is the rightful heir to the throne and hence is a 'royal'. I liked Jon Snow as a bastard brought up by Ned Stark. This is because the best person on the show was just an ordinary guy who goes against great odds to prove himself as a great leader and someone we could root for. Knowing he is actually royalty affects that feeling to an extent. So my question is that what does making Jon the son of R and L accomplish for Jon and the overall plot?

4) Was the whole Essos storyline for Dany just to develop her and allow her to get an army? I understand this necessity, but was I the only one who found that plot the least entertaining?

Would really appreciate some answers.",gameofthrones,True,1517729757,2018-02-04

Personally I imagine him as an old man, with a face physically much like [Thedeon possessed by Saruman](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SFogXTIv3MY/maxresdefault.jpg) (something savage), but still with the body of a warrior, and every time I think about him I can't just help myself but seeing him shouting ""BURN THEM ALL"" while spitting around while shouting orders.",gameofthrones,True,1517771922,2018-02-04
[EVERYTHING] Game Of Thrones Provokes Strong Emotions.,"Can you guys name a scene in a episode, which made you feel happy,sad,excited,disappointed etc

The scene that made me the most happy would probably have to be when arya reunited with Sansa, either that or when Joffrey or Ramsay died.

Saddest moment was when rickon died, I saw it coming but it was still sad.

Most shocking moment was the red wedding. I had a feeling something was going to happen but didn't know exactly what. 

Most angry moment was when stannis agreed to burn shireen alive, like wtf you moron! Wake tf up!

Most confused scene is when petyr baelish gave Sansa to the bolton's

Most disappointed when theon betrayed the Starks.

[MAIN SPOILERS] Prince that was promised mistake.,"I have this idea.. And note that I have absolutely ZERO evidence of this. It's just an idea and I wondered what people thought. Okay so this whole prophecy of TPTWP and AA being Jon is probably legit. Even if it's not lets just say it is for this idea to work. 

Do you think it's possible that Jon is named this so called hero but in fact it was actually someone else who was the hero but Jon gets all the praise for it. Yes he fits the prophesy but what if the prophesy was confused with someone close to Jon? If you get what mean... 

Like think of it this way. Example. Back in season 7 when Jon and crew went beyond the wall what if somehow the Hound or Jorah managed to slay the nightking and ended the White walkers? But died in the process along with everyone else except Jon. 
 Then Jon makes it back to the wall as the sole survivor and is remembered as the one who ended the night. Or in the case Azor Ahai. 

I guess the point is, the prophecy could still hold meaning but I wouldn't be surprised if some twist like that happened and it was someone completely different, but still within reason like The Hound, Jorah, Jamie, Brienne etc... 
It's something GRRM would probably do and I can imagine Jon hating the praise that he gets when he knows it's undeserved as he is a humble type man. 

I just feel like there prophecy will just be extremely foggy by the end of it and perhaps circle the truth rather then just point right at it like Jon. ",gameofthrones,True,1517810600,2018-02-05

I haven’t heard this theory before and I feel like I have read through a lot of this sub. 

So I feel like it’s a pretty strong theory that Tyrion is a Targaryen but how do you think he got into lots Tywins hands?  Do you think when the mountain was supposedly killing the Targaryen children like all the stories say than Tywin actually saved the boy and that was Tyrion?  It would make sense with all the incest of Targaryens of why Tyrion is described as so grotesque in the books. I just don’t know why Tywin would want to keep him safe? Maybe he has a soft spot for kids? But then also how did his wife actually die?  We only ever hear from Cersei that it was from childbirth and she wouldn’t have actually been there to know so Tywin could have just been saying that. Or she actually could have died during childbirth and the baby also died and that’s why Tywin had a soft spot for babies and saved Tyrion.

It has been said that when the last dragon died, magic faded from the world, does that mean the children of the forest's magic faded too or are they seperate types/forces.

Thanks guys

[No spoilers] intro video request,"We have seen some great game of thrones intros with a cross of adventure time and other beloved shows.

My request is please someone who knows how to do this. Please make a Thomas the tank engine intro done game of thrones style with the theme song. 

Include locations of sodor, misty island and anything a Thomas buff would know of. 

Been watching Thomas with my toddler a lot and rewatching game of thrones with the wife, so I thought this would be a funny lil idea to try. 

I've looked online and can't find one like this and I am not saavy in the world of animation. The closest thing I've found is just someone using the Thomas song infront of the game of thrones intro.... that's the opposite of what I'm looking for hahaha.

If you can do this I would be so happy! And if you know anyone capable please pass this along. I don't have anything to offer with the new year being slow at work per usual but I will definitely smile and laugh and cheer and show it to all my friends and family that enjoy both.

[EVERYTHING] The Valonqar Prophecy if genetics works the same way in GoT,"**This is not a serious theory, just a thought experiment that occurred to me while reading about genetics and GoT in the same day**

Science part of reddit correct me if I am wrong. But since Jaime and Cersei are siblings, couldn't they have a 50% chance of producing a child that shares the exact same chromosomes as either of them.

Jaime has his fathers Y Chromosome

Cersei has her fathers X Chromosome, we will call this X^T
 
Both have 1 of their mothers X chromosomes, we will call these X^1 and X^2

Assuming that Jaime and Cersei both go the same X Chromosome from their mother (this completely falls apart if they didn't), making them:

X^1 + Y = Jaime

X^1 + X^T = Cersei

 then the 4 potential combinations they could produce would be:

X^1   +    Y = Almost genetically identical to Jaime.

X^2   +    Y = 1 Joanna Chromosome, 1 Tywin Chromosome.

X^1   +    X^T = Almost genetically identical to Cersei.

X^1   +    X^2 = Almost genetically identical to Joanna Lannister *their mother*. (wrap your head around that weirdness)

In any case *every* child that Cersei and Jaime has would by genetic standards be their siblings (as they would contain only genetic material passed down from Tywin and Joanna). Meaning if Cersei is really pregnant, and with a boy. Then if she were to die in childbirth, the prophecy could be considered complete, as her male children are genetically her little brothers.

[Everything] what's up with the hands?,"I've been mostly a show watcher for a few years now, but I decided to get back to reading the book series.  After re-reading the first book, I got to thinking about a weird connection.  On many occasions, it talks about Jon flexing his hand to help it heal from the burns.  In many of the Catlyn chapters it talks about her doing that as well, as she heals from the dagger wounds.  It comes up a lot, in both POVs.  I feel like it has to mean some kind of connection or foreshadowing or whatever.  It just struck me as weird how often and how similarly it comes up, especially for two characters that don't seem to have much of a connection. ",gameofthrones,True,1517875491,2018-02-05
[Main Spoilers]Anyone else feel that DnD are conflicted on how to write Dany's character?,"Throughout the show, there's been moments and hints dropped here and there, that Dany is walking a thin line between being a good ruler and being more like her father. This is not me calling her ""The Mad Queen"", this is just me acknowledging that the show has in fact at times brought it up with her character, even having other characters mention it to her. It was in Season 7 that we really got to see her thirst for conquest, her quick temper, and that she was willing to burn men without considering other options. 

It almost feels like in any other story, she would be getting set up as a villain. But instead we have a situation where the show will have her at times do cruel things, and have parallels between her and her father's behavior, and yet will still paint her as a hero and savior. Almost as if DnD want to show her as morally grey and a hypocrite, but don't want to fully go through with it, maybe due to the character's popularity. But in any other story, I swear it would be obvious to any viewer or reader that this character is going down a dark path at this point. But there's 6 episodes left, which seem like they'll be dedicated to the White Walker event, so I'm having my doubts. I'm not saying I want her to be a villain, but I don't want this series to end without all those moments of her doing cruel things having some kind of a point to it all.",gameofthrones,True,1517879923,2018-02-05

I mean its pretty common for people to have their fathers hair color, myself included. And seeing how Robert was all for killing Dany when she was a young girl there was no way he could have seen silver-haired Jon without going ballistic. 


What would Ned have done? Seems pretty unlikely that Ned would still raise him as his own, to me it feels like he would have hidden him from everyone or sent him far away because there is no way he could have lived with the rest of the Starks. 


Do you think Jon would ended up having a similar story to Dany? Sent as far away as possible from Bobby B?

I ask because I think of it in two different ways.

[Everything] Sansa and Gendry on the throne,"I’ve been thinking about this for awhile and think it’s at least possible. Sansa story has been about politics the way Jon’s has been about leadership and war, and Arya’s has been about being a assassin. Sansa has learned from a lot of people about how to be a good leader. From Ned she got her honor but has adapted it to fit in a place like kings landing. Little Finger she learned how to think like her enemies and play the game. Even from Cersei and Ramsay she learned important lessons. If she is the queen then who is the king? In the first episode Robert tells Ned they should join their houses and I think it would be fitting and surprising to see that happen. Gendry is a underdog but he is also the last of the Baratheons and has a claim through Robert. You may ask what about Jon and Dany.

For example: “Beneath the Brine” by The Family Crest seems like a good song for Theon and the Greyjoys in general.,gameofthrones,True,1517963854,2018-02-06
[NO SPOILERS] What are everyone's thoughts on the likely GoT prequel / spin off series?,"Keeping in mind that there hasn't been a huge amount of information released on this, i'm already in two minds. Obviously I love the Game of Thrones universe, so having an extension of that with more information, more backstory, more characters introduced, more of the lore brought to light, and just *more* in general seems fantastic.. However, at the same time I really am concerned.

I can't personally think of a spin off series I have legitimately enjoyed, or one that has even come close to being as good as the original series it was based off. I am doubly worried with that because of how high GoT set the bar in the first place, that I would be surprised if it could live up to that. I also feel like a lot of spin off or prequel series come off as quick cash grabs by being associated with the successful original series, and the potential of 'tainting' the series or running it into the ground over time is also a point of concern for me. I guess it also raises the question: Is it even necessary? Should we just let this wonderful series go out on (hopefully) a high note? Obviously it's hard to have a complete opinion at this point in time, but i'm already feeling conflicted.

What are your thoughts?",gameofthrones,True,1517966674,2018-02-06

"[EVERYTHING] Realistically, would the Dothraki willingly fight in...","...the great war to come against the White Walkers?  I get the impression that the Unsullied are loyal because they appreciate what Dany did for them, are grateful/indebted to her, and would do anything for her.  I get the feeling the Dothraki are only there because they were in awe of Dany's power and had something to gain. (look at how quickly they abandoned previous Khals when the Alpha Male no longer provided)  

Facing the WW risks a lot, and beating the WW gains them nothing--no land, women, money, horses...so how would she keep the Dothraki motivated?  Am I just missing the bond of loyalty that the show tried to portray?  Is glory in battle really enough for them?

[Everything] Who would you rather see as the 1000th Lord Commander...,"Would you rather see Jorah Mormont and Jaime Lannister take over the position as the 1000th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch. 

Argument for Jorah Mormont: He would take the same position that was held by his late father, Jeor Mormont. He would continue the legacy the of watching the realms of men. Just as Jeor joined the Watch when he realized Jorah should use have his time to lead, Jorah could see the future of his house is in strong, capabale by hand in the young Lyanna Mormont. We also saw him admit his guilt and say that Ned Stark was right in trying to take his head after he sold the poachers into slavery. As we know, joining the Watch would grant him a pardon for those crimes. 


Arguments for Jaime: All along the we have heard that the only woman Jaime loves is his Cersei, and now that he has left her this would be a reason to never lay with another woman again. Also, in the only interaction we’ve seen between Jaime and Jon Snow Jaime mocks his choice of joining the Watch. It would also be one last twist of the knife in the late Tywin Lannister who was deadset on relieving his treasured son from his Kings Guard vows so he could take over as his heir. Now that Jaime has left he could join the Nights Watch and fully remove himself from his fathers legacy. He also said he meant to keep his promise in fighting the Night King. That could possibly mean he takes the black even if they win the War for the Dawn. 


I think either of these men taking over the position could be a fitting end to their story arcs. What do you think? ",gameofthrones,True,1516651244,2018-01-22

[S2E10] Tyrell loyalties,"I'm going back through the show and it never occurred to me to question it until now. After repelling Stannis from King's Landing Margaery and Loras talk Joffrey into agreeing to marry Margaery, but why would Joffrey and the Lannisters allow an audience with the Tyrells in the first place? 

I understand that Stannis is a mutual enemy of the Lannisters and the Tyrells, but the Tyrells previously declared for Renly and supported his claim to the throne. It seems like Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin, and the others just forgot about the Tyrell's treason.

I understand that there are some advantages to allying themselves with the Tyrells, so I guess I'm just more annoyed that they didn't mention it at all, like nothing ever happened. At least I don't think they mentioned it. It seems more believable that Cersei, Tywin, or Joffrey would have them killed at first sight for supporting Renly and then a Tyrell cousin would take over the Reach, and that would have made things interesting.",gameofthrones,True,1516693304,2018-01-23

"[EVERYTHING] A theory/Prediction on Jaime, Bran, Azor Ahai, and The endgame","Today I am going to give you an updated version of a post that I made awhile back that stated why I believe Jaime could be Azor Ahai. This time I will have more evidence and I will also includes elements of a amazing theory I heard that the story of GOT takes inspiration from Norse Mythology mainly the story of Ragnarok. There are many parallels to Norse Mythology and Ragnarok in the story but today I will be mainly focusing on two Jaime and Bran.

I will also be explaining why I believe Jaime is Azor Ahai. So I will get to the evidence of why Jaime, one of the most complex characters in the series is the Prince that was Promised/Azor Ahai Reborn.

Evidence:

- Red star bleeding I think refers to either the Red Comet or the destruction of the sept as the Faith of the seven symbol is a red star. In the books case it could refer to the death of Oberyn as he is from House Martell and the sigil of House Martell is a red sun and spear which can be seen as a red star bleeding.

- Now being reborn admits salt and smoke can refer to anything, It could refer to when Jaime got his hand cut off as there was a fire set up there (fire as in campfire) which gives off smoke with the salt being Jaime's salty sweat or tears. It can refer to his bath where he stats he is Jaime (the smoke is the steam from the bath and the salt the water), it could refer to Field of fire 2.0 with the smoke from the flames and Jaime going into salty water, or maybe it will be a event that has not happen yet like maybe when Jaime confronts Cersei again he is killed but later resurrected by a red Priest on a funeral pyre near blackwater bay (I think it's obvious what the salt and smoke would be there), However in Alt Shift X's vid on Jaime he stats Jaime could be resurrected when the wildfire goes off in the red keep coming out unburnt. Whatever one is the salt and smoke he could fulfill or has already fulfilled this part of the prophecy.

- Now I do believe that Jaime is the bastard of the Mad King so that solves the blood of the dragon part.

- Some believe Jaime's hand is Lightbringer or Widow's wail is Lightbringer but I believe Ice will be reforged and in a poetic act a reforged Ice will be his Lightbringer. Or maybe Widow's Wail will.

- Of course Cersei is Nissa Nissa, and before you start YES I am aware Valonqar is not mentioned in the show but just because it was not does not mean Jaime will not kill Cersei.

- Also if we look at Jaime's Journey it fits with Azor Ahai. Azor Ahai first tempered his blade in water but it broke, then he tried again this time plunging the sword into the heart of a captive lion but the steel shattered again, Then finally with all his heart he made the blade again and tempered it into the heart of his beloved wife Nissa Nissa. Now in the books it may be different as the water could be Lady Stoneheart, The Lion could be Cersei or Tyrion, and Nissa Nissa is Cersei or Brienne. For the Show the water was when he told Brienne the truth in the bath, The Lion is when he helped Tyrion escape, and Nissa Nissa is not only when he left Cersei but when he will return and kill her.

Now I will get to how it relates to Ragnarok. So there are actually some parallel between GOT and the story of Ragnarok. I will not go into too much detail but I would recommend watching these two youtube videos as they are really good and give good analysis on the theory:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geqbQyx2Nug&amp;t=2105s

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4vG28iFpgg

I'd also recommend reading this:

http://gameofthronesandnorsemythology.blogspot.ca/2013/05/jaime-azor-ahai-god-of-war.html

So as I was saying there are some parallels. These include that the Mad King is Odin, Robert Baratheon is Thor, Cersei is either Frigg or Hela, in my opinion Euron is Satur (and I may make a separate post on why I think that), Jaime is Tyr, and Bran is Fenrir. Now in the legend Fenrir was chained to the earth by Tyr, this pretty much made him angry so be bit Tyr's hand off. Jaime pushed Bran out of the tower pretty much in a sense chaining him to the earth and while Bran did not bit Jaime's hand off Jaime did get his hand cut off. Now this is where the theory gets interesting because if this is correct then I think sense Fenrir was a dark character in Norse Mythology then Bran could become a villain near the end with Jaime of course as Azor Ahai.

The reason for this is because in the books Bran is pretty much told be the three Eyed Raven to go into the darkness and even has him drink a paste that may or may not be Jojen Reed. Now in the show I think it may have to be something different like maybe the Bran=Night King theory ends up being true or more likely Bran is captured by the Night King and is turned into a White Walker. But what evidence do I have for this...well not too much but enough:

1. Bran is being setup as a dark character in the books there is what I just mentioned and he has been acting alittle off in the show not to mention kindof creepy. While Jaime has pretty much been redeemed

2. It's obvious Jaime and Bran will meet again but Jaime I think will apologize to Bran which I think would make it harder for Jaime to have to stop him when Bran goes rouge.

3. Maisie Williams the actress who plays Arya stark stated that the ending will be something we don't expect. Yes we should never take what actors or actresses say as actual evidence (especially when this is the same person who claims to love Pepperoni and Cheese Pizza and yet in one interview I saw she says she does NOT eat dairy so...yeah who knows. also sorry for getting off topic) but she did read the script so she may be telling the truth. Jaime being Azor Ahai and Bran being the villain in the end would be a good twist.

4. It's been said there are three twist from the books that will happen in the show. So far those twist from what I understand are either Shireen's burning or Jon's resurrection and Hold the Door (Jon's parentage reveal does not count as we all saw that coming). The third twist could revolve around Jaime being Azor Ahai.

So too recap I believe that Jaime could be Azor Ahai and if the Ragnarok theory is true then Bran in the books could go dark from BloodRaven's influence and in the show could be turned into a White Walker by the Night King. Jaime would kill Cersei to forge Lightbringer and will drive back the darkness and be forced to kill Bran and the NK in order to save everyone.

[EVERYTHING] Craziest thing that happens in the books that doesn't happen in the show?,"I was trying to remember some of the nutzo stuff that takes place in the books that they left out in the show adaptations. Honestly seems like they are at a premium, but one that stands out to me is: 

The 1v1 between Biter and Brienne of Tarth. Dude was basically eating her face. 

The way Ramsay is revealed in the books is pretty awesome too, though I am a fan of the way it was done by D&amp;D also. Some of the Ramsay stuff in general is selective for this topic as well. Like locking that chick in the tower and she ended up eating her own finger tips.

[AGOT] Just started reading Clash... did the quality drop off?,"Hi!

I'm a pretty picky reader... I love SF and fantasy when I can get into it, but a lot of the time I read the first page and feel that it's just not *well-written* enough. Tolkien, Le Guin, Gene Wolfe always pass my tests... I wish more did. :(

Anyway, *A Game of Thrones* passed with flying colors. I absolutely loved it, cover to cover. But I'm 100 pages into *A Clash of Kings*, and it feels of much lower quality. The writing strikes me as clumsy; there's a lot of unnecessary obvious statements, often coming from characters' thoughts; the dealings at Dragonstone (prelude and the first Davos section) feel so obvious and heavy-handed.

So did the quality of writing drop off? Is there any conventional wisdom on this, like does the quality generally get worse over the series, or does it peak somewhere and then get worse? (I'm talking mostly about atmosphere and writing style, not plot or whether things are dragging.) I'm trying to decide whether to go on. The first book cast such a spell on me, and I'm worried the spell is breaking...

[EVERYTHING] An interesting theory I found about Howland Reed and Ashara Dayne,"Okay so I heard a very interesting theory online recently that stated that the true person to sleep with Howland Reed was not Brandon Stark or Ned Stark but...........Wait for it........Howland Reed. In reality he was the one that Ashara loved and was infatuated with. The rest of it goes that they met at Harrenhal fell in love and at some point either before or during Robert's rebellion married and conceived Meera. After the tower of Joy Howland picked up Ashara and the made up the story of her death and Ashara goes under the name Jeyna Reed.

Now I have left the link to where I found the theory up top and to be honest I like parts of it but idk it seems like a short amount of time to get married and conceive a kid, also for this to work I think it would've had to have been a secret marriage and they would have to fake Ashara's suicide somehow.",gameofthrones,True,1516750711,2018-01-23

BUT... the release of the white ravens also happens in season 6 ep 10, there's a scene of a bunch of them flying from the citadel and sansa is telling Jon about them and that winter is here. 

So I guess the questions would be:

Was this a goof of some sort?

If it wasn't a goof, does it mean that from the scene in s2 and scene in s6, that the timeframe between (a few years) is Autumn?

However, upon analyzing this statement I now realize that it was an early warning of Janos Slynt's betrayal of Ned. The one word that hints at this is *behind*. If Janos Slynt had said ""the men of the watch stand *with* you"" then that would have been better. The fact that he said *behind you* technically meant that they hadn't pledged to protect him and therefore the statement left the option of betrayal open.  ",gameofthrones,True,1516772690,2018-01-24

[Main Spoilers] Question about Jamie in latest seasons.,"I've been rewatching series 7 recently and had a thought regarding Jamie. At the beginning of season 7, would he be the great Lord of House Lannister? 

His father Tywin, the former lord of house Lannister passed away a couple of seasons ago when he was shot by Tyrion. If I remember correctly the title couldn't pass to Jamie at the time, because he was a member of the Kingsguard. But since King Tommen removed Jamie from the Kingsguard in season 6 (in response to Jamie marching against the Faith Militant), that obstacle no longer applied.

Obviously as of the end of season 7 the question is kind of moot. But I thought it was interesting to ask, and can't remember if the show confirms it- was our favourite golden-haired one-handed sister-shagging dragon-charging quipmaster briefly known as 'Lord Jamie of House Lannister?'",gameofthrones,True,1516781593,2018-01-24

[Everything] Book/TV differences: Are they important to the ending?,"Bear with me- this might get a bit long-winded. And please note, I have only read one of the chapters of The Winds of Winter as it appears at the end of the other books in the Kindle series, so I may be missing some bits that have been already published…

Anyway, moving on:

So, we know that GRRM gave D&amp;D the ending of the saga so they could get on with the TV series, and we also know that there are things missing and changed between the actual book story and the TV series. Here are my questions

a)How much of the omitted work is because of cost?

b) If something is omitted, can we assume that it has no bearing on the overall story as it works out?

c) Can we work out some of the things that will happen in the next book given what has been happening in the TV series?

If the answer is b- that things are omitted because they have no overall bearing on the story, does this mean that as book readers we can ignore the Young Griff/Aeron Targaryen story? If this is the case, then we know that he is not going to be the heir to the throne, as he would be Jon’s older brother if he was the real one, and integral to the succession in the TV stories as well as the books. In this case, we can possibly extrapolate that he will die in the books, and therefore play no part other than narrative expansion on the part of GRRM.

We can also say that Dorne is unimportant in the grand scheme of things, since the Dorne arc has been seriously played down through the whole TV series, despite the major parts it plays in the books. We saw Myrcella poisoned in the series, however in the books, she has an ear sliced off and her face disfigured by Darkstar before she is sent on her way home. So far, she is still alive, but can we assume that she will die before reaching King’s Landing, because she has already been killed in the series?

The same can be asked about Shireen Baratheon: In the series, she was burned by her father and mother as a sacrifice to R’Hillor, however in the books, she is still alive at the Wall. We do however have Val saying that she is a dead girl walking because of the Greyscale, despite her supposedly being “cured” of it as a child, and Val wants the Monster (Gilly’s baby) out of the same tower that Shireen lives in. In the books, Ramsey has also written to Jon Snow telling him Stannis is dead, so Stannis wouldn’t be around to sacrifice Shireen. Selyse is also alive, but in the series, she hangs herself after the burning of her daughter. Given that they are all dead in the series, but only Stannis is dead in the books, can we assume that an end will come for Selyse and Shireen, and them be irrelevant to the main story in the next book?

Similarly, I have seen a lot of theories about Patchface, Shireen’s fool, and how he is all sorts of different characters. Given that he doesn’t even appear in the TV series, can we write off all these theories as being fanciful, as he obviously has no part to play in the finale of the main story? All the theories I’ve seen make him a central character of some sort, and occasionally I’ve seen comments that he could be a god, father of the NK and all sorts.

Going on to other differences, we have the two babies, Dalla’s and Gilly’s, and someone did say that GRRM never really wrote anything without a purpose, so there must be some sort of story for them, although it’s not played out in the the TV series.

One other major difference is the Hound: In the books, Sandor Clegane is dead (or possibly retired to the Quiet Isle), but the Hound (as a helmeted man) lives on and is doing all sorts of bad things, last heard of as Rorge who bit part of Brienne’s cheek off, then passing to Lem Lemoncloak. Given that premise, I wonder why he is still alive in the series, and the only thing I can figure out is that they kept him because he’s a popular character who says “cunt” a lot, and they’re working up to a major fight with his brother, the stiff.

There are a lot of things that can be extrapolated from the omissions from the TV series as to what will follow in tWoW, but these are some of the few that stick out as being important differences and extrapolations, and indeed spoilers for the book, although we don’t know how some will play out.

I for one will be interested to find out what happens to Shireen, since she’s a likeable character in both mediums, and the comments from Val about the greyscale are intriguing. I really wish GRRM would get the book out instead of publishing excerpts in bits and pieces, like breadcrumbs to appease the starving masses though. What do other people think though- will the books and TV marry up in the end, or are they going to be vaguely similar, but not quite? Or something else entirely?

[MAIN SPOILERS] Why is Ice so much bigger than other valyrian swords?,"I have for a long time wondered why the Starks sword Ice so much bigger than all the other valyrian sword. Valyrian swords are expensive and rare but Ice is so big that it could melted into two, so one can be quite sure it's a very special sword. 

So why is it so big? What is the reason that the biggest valyrian sword is located in the North? It has been in Starks possession for centuries and I think that is there for a reason. 

One might think with all the history and tales of the North that the Starks needed a bigger sword for killing giants and what not living beyond the wall, but I have also read the comments on that Ice being to big to wield in actual combat. Ice being to big in man on man combat might be true, but what if Ice is not meant to be used for killing men? Surely there must be a reason that a sword is made that big? Well my theory is that Ice is a sword for killing dragons and I'll try to give an explanation for my wild theory.

First of all the NK was not that surprised that three dragons showed up to save Jon and his gang. My guess is that it wasn't the first time he came into contact with dragons, almost logical to think that he might have owned owned a ice dragon before. He was at least quite aware of them being around..

With the prophecy of hero reborn (AA) that once before won the fight against the NK after wielding Lightbringer. To my knowledge this fight ended at Winterfell, thus the name Winterfell.. 

Some say that Ice can't be Lightbringer because it is not old enough with it being forged in ancient valyria after the Long Night took place and after The Wall was built. Well I'm not that concerned about the historical details, not everything is that black on white in Westeros history. 

Well back to Ice being Lightbringer. If AA fought and defeated NK and the battle was won at Winterfell, wouldnt it be quite possibel that Ice would be left there? 

If you now take into consideration that Jaime is heading North with Widows wail, Brienne already on her way North with Oathkeeper, Gendry being a blacksmith and all also currently in the North. Taking all these things into consideration there must be a reason for this team up, there simply must be a reason for it and in my opinion there can't be any other than that Ice must be reforged. In my opionion there are very few alternatives that could end up being LB, I have read all the theorys about dragons, Jamie's hand etc. being LB but I personally think that Jaimes hand being LB would be quite lame. Would he use it to strangle NK or how would it work? I don't know, but I'm not convinced.

So why is Ice made for killing dragons? Well if you think about it, how could Jon and Dany actually kill an Ice dragon? Well if they risk it all and go up for a dragon fight in the skies they risk loosing another dragon thus giving NK two dragons and the chance of winning the war would be reduced to none. And to be fair, why would the series end with two dragons taking down the Ice dragon, seems a bit to obvious? This is why Ice has to be reforged imo. They will need a sword (Ice) big enough to kill (behead) the dragon with a single blow. I'm not saying there won't be a dragon fight, but I don't think the war will end by danys dragon killing the ice dragon in a dog fight. 

If I were to guess I think Ice will be reforged either because Brienne and Jaime thinks it's the right thing to do (knights honor) or Sam finds a text in his book revealing Ice history and importance in killing (ice)dragons.

So what do you guys think, is this to much of a tinfoil theory? I might have got some details wrong and only sharing this because I'm a big fan of the show and my intention is not to offend anyone. Cheers!",gameofthrones,True,1516828195,2018-01-24

[MAIN SPOILERS] Forshadowing Of Arya’s Death In A Game Of Thrones?,"I noticed this a while back now but I’ve never got around to actually writing it down. With all the theories that come up with ASOIAF I’m surprised I’ve never seen this come up as it fans tend to find clues in a lot more cryptic circumstances.

It comes in Arya’s first POV chapter in A Game Of Thrones when Jon and Arya are talking about Arya’s hate Of needlework as they watch the Lannister children spar with the other Stark children. 

“The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You’ll be sewing all through Winter. When the Spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.”

In regards to the hiding part, this is something I’ve only just realised now while checking the exact quote for this post. This could be a reference to Arya hiding by using other people’s appearances as a Faceless Man, with the reference to penance meaning her association with the Faceless Men will lead to her downfall. 

I think the other hints at her demise are a lot more obvious. Jon talking about her being found dead in Winter with a needle in her hands obviously refers to her sword named needle, and being found in Winter is likely referring to the coming war with The Others.

If the show has accurately portrayed the events of The Winds Of Winter, I’d like to see Arya’s death happen in the defence of Winterfell during a great battle with The Others that we will hopefully see during Season 8.

[NO SPOILERS] Game of Thrones Season 8 May Include a Pregnancy Storyline,"There may be a surprise pregnancy at the center of Game of Thrones‘ upcoming season 8. Little is known about what fans can expect from the popular fantasy series, which is not scheduled to return to HBO until sometime in 2019.

Based on the Song Of Ice And Fire saga by author George R. R. Martin, Game of Thrones has proven a surprising hit for HBO since it first premiered in 2011. A rare critical and commercial success for a show set in the sword-and-sorcery genre, the series has won 38 Emmy Awards including two consecutive wins for Outstanding Drama Series in 2015 and 2016. Among other honors, the show has won three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation and a 2011 Peabody Award.

The rumor was first reported as a Blind Item on TVLine‘s website. Without naming Game of Thrones specifically, the site claimed to have confirmed that “a wildly popular, Emmy-winning series on a premium cable network is plotting a pregnancy twist that promises to be… surprising is an understatement.” The report also said that this series was not planned to return until 2019. Game of Thrones would certainly fit the bill on both counts. The questions remains, however, as to which two characters are involved in the pregnancy and what would constitute this turn of events being so shocking as to render the word “surprising” an understatement?

I think there’s plenty of evidence out there that connects him to the prophecy, but I got to thinking about something that I don’t see mentioned that often. Melisandra first thought that Stanis was the prince that was promised, and then John, but what if the flames and visions were showing her Davos all along? Davos was there both with Stanis and John, but she would have completely overlooked him because he’s just a simple common man in her mind.

"[EVERYTHING] So you wake up in Jon Snow's body, how do you deal with the WW invasion?","First things first, knowing how the NK reinforces his numbers you'd need to find a way to group up the population. So if your army pushes them back the NK can't just leave, re arm off a few un/ lightly protected cities. I'd send word for anyone capable to retreat to these locations; 1. Dorne. Anybody from lands south of King's landing ie the Stormlands and the reach should bring their people to Dorne. The mountain pass acts similarly to the Neck in the north in that it's easily defendable. 2. Harrenhall. For the rest of Westeros, that doesn't have the natural protection of Puke/ the Vale, running all the way to Dorne would be a long trip in the summer. Harrenhall is a massive castle conveniently located in the dead center of Westeros. Men from all over could flock to Harrenhall, unlike other more easily defended smaller castles like the Eerie or Storm's end.

At this point you know the final battle will be humanity's final stand. You throw everything at the NK to try and kill the head. A shield wall composed of unsullied and Westerosi knights protect the main gate, baiting the NK's army against the walls of Harrenhall where militia will rain down arrow fire from the battlements. Also use any wildfire you can get your hands on from King's landing (where I'm assuming if I'm Tyrion that Cersei is still making the stuff after you find out she's not on your side), Ballistas to shoot at the NK's dragon and any other tricks like Lava pots you can think up. Viseryon's flames hopefully keep the NK from roasting the castle, especially if it's being controlled by warg Bran.

 As this happen you have to launch your Gandalf charge. The Dothraki and riders of the Vale charge from a hidden location on the frozen God's eye, led by a vanguard of Drogon/ Dany, Jon and EVERY knight with a Valyrian steel blade you can get your hand on. This includes all your living major characters; Jon, Jaime (or whoever takes his sword if he dies killing Cersei), Brienne, Beric (your red shirt), Arya and whoever Sam gives Heartsbane to (preferrably Jorah).

[S5] Finale - Just finished watching it and...,"Is me again. I've never watched Game of Thrones, I started watching it in 2017, don't know why I waited this long to do so. Is fucking good. I was the one asking a month ago about how Danery's was immune to fire, and how the many face man was captured when he was a pro. I almost got a mini heart attack when I saw the fake him die. I hope he is alive, whoever he is. Cersei Lannister got watch she deserved. Too bad she isn't dead, yet. What happened to Myrcella Baratheon was sad. She didn't deserve to die. Poor, Jaime Lannister after one of his children accepted him. I know that he crippled Brandon Stark, but all the same, I've forgiven him. I just like him ...don't know why.  I hope Stannis Baratheon burns in hell for killing Shireen, and that Melisandre will burn in the seven hells for this. Well, Jon snow isn't dead or is he? I know he comes back in Season 6.

Option 1: Whoever received the most votes wins.

Option 2: The percentage of votes received would equal the probability of that character winning. (Example: if a character received 75% of the total votes, they would have a 75% chance of winning.) A random number generator would be used to decide this. 1-75=win, 76-100=loss.

[MAIN SPOILERS] A couple of questions regarding the early scheming in season 1.,"1. If I understand right, based off Varys and Illyrios walk 'n' talk in the dungeons, Varys was loyal to the Targaeryns, and trying to keep the realm stable while the Targ's grew up and gained power for a long term invasion. With that in mind, why did he provide King Robert with Intel about Dany's pregnancy and endorse her assassination? I know he would have to play the 'role' of the loyal spymaster and therefore couldn't give obviously bad advice, but as this news came from Ser Jorah who I believe was reporting to Varys directly, couldn't Varys have just covered this piece of intel up?

2. Littlefingers strategy was to start a chaotic war with the intent of taking advantage of it to gain power for himself. To do this he pitted the Starks and Lannisters against each other in a plot that required Ned and Cat to play into his hands in ways that weren't guaranteed to happen. Yes, their behaviour was predictable, but not guaranteed. If littlefinger was wanting to cause chaos and was sitting on information regarding the bastard Baratheon children, why didn't he simply reveal that information to King Robert to instigate a Baratheon-Lannister war instead of the more complex plan to instigate a Lannister-Stark Civil War?",gameofthrones,True,1517085050,2018-01-27

[Everything] Cersei end of season 7,"Cersei is claiming to be pregnant again by Jamie, however I am very dubious about whether she is or not. The reasons I feel this are as follows:

First of all, the prophecy, which says she will only have three children, “gold their crowns and gold their shrouds”. I know she told Catelyn about the black haired baby, but in the books, she actually had an abortion, acquired by Jaime, on the only occasion that she became pregnant by Robert.

On the other hand, the pregnancy could always not go to term, still fulfilling the three children aspect of the prophecy, especially if it happens very early on.

Secondly, given the number of times she and Jaime had sex, and only three children being born, it makes me wonder about her fertility. Tommen was 9 in the books, and older if the TV series is to be used as evidence. Joffrey was 14, and Myrcella was a year older than Tommen, so there were 5 years between the three children. If you add in to that the amount that Cersei was drinking, the stress in her life, as well as the poor diet during her imprisonment in the Sept, it’s entirely possible that she is merely having irregular periods that she is interpreting as pregnancy. Even a hangover could be mistaken as morning sickness.

The period of time and the technology at hand is pretty much similar to the medieval period of Britain, and there weren’t any reliable pregnancy tests around at that time. Any missing periods could be seen as pregnancy, and quite famously, Mary Tudor had false pregnancies, one of which may well have been a tumour that eventually killed her. She had at least one period of lying in, when she was “due”, but no baby was born, and she eventually had to come out of her chambers as childless as she went in.

There is also the possibility of a phantom pregnancy. We already know that she has mental health problems because she suffers badly from paranoia, and having lost three children in pretty quick succession (one of which was directly caused by her actions, although she chooses to blame Tyrion instead), I would assume she is suffering from depression as well. It could be that she is so desperate to be pregnant that her body is giving all the signs without her actually carrying a child.

Finally, she seems to fear she is losing Jaime’s loyalty, as he has drawn back from her more than once, and while she was a prisoner of the High Sparrow, she messaged Jaime telling him to come at once, which he didn’t. Her paranoia will see him as possibly turning against her as so many others have already, and the news of another child could just be a way to try to bind him to her side. We know she is not above lying to get her own way, and this could just be another example of that.

I don’t know really. Is she pregnant? Is she faking it, knowingly or unknowingly? Could it be that she’s just mistaken because her periods are out of whack because of her lifestyle and incarceration? Could it be a deliberate lie, and the last straw that will see Jaime snap and kill her when he finds out about her duplicity, thus completing the prophecy about the Valonquar?

Personally I’m leaning towards her not being pregnant, but thinking she is, but continuing the lie to Jaime once she discovers the truth, then him finding out. Anyone else have any thoughts?

[S1] Robert’s instructions,"While rewatching season 1, I noticed a plot element that really didn’t make any sense. When Robert dies and gives his will to Ned, how the fuck was Cersei allowed to just straight up ignore it and tear it up? Robert clearly signed off on it, and the Baratheon seal was unbroken. Ned was supposed to be protector of the realm and serve as temp king till Joffrey came of age. Even though Ned wrote “rightful heir” instead of Joffrey specifically, he hadn’t made any indication yet that he was pulling for Stannis, so nobody should have questioned anything.

I just don’t understand how Cersei and Joffrey just instantly have complete power over Ned and could do literally whatever they wanted the second Robert died, even when Robert himself had a plan laid out that went against their motives.

It would have shown that despite how hard he fought he couldn’t survive in an open fight between two armies, subjecting people’s expectations as well since the scene was so similar to Jon’s in the Battle of the Bastards. I like Bronn as a character but I feel as though he has survived for way too long for someone that was only in it for money, plus it seems as though there are so many characters now who escape death on a regular basis that it would have been a good shock to the fans.

[EVERYTHING] Daenerys is a tragic destroyer.,"Before you attack me and call me a troll, let me explain. When I first started reading the books I realized that Daenerys was making a lot of mistakes in Essos ad I thought that those mistakes were completely understandable, she was a young girl, with no experience in ruling and it was normal to have failures BUT by the end of the saga she would have mature and turned into a solid and capable ruler and that would be her character arc. But then I realized that we are on book 5 of a series of 7, in the tv show we are going to the last and final season and she still isn’t a capable and reliable ruler. 

Daenerys went to  Astapor and took the city army and ordered all the slavers to murdered, she then left the city (since she had no interest at all in them) and the city fell apart. Daenerys destroyed the power structure of Astapor which is not a tragedy in itself because of how rotten it was. But then she creates an ad hoc council of people she barely know but think are nice and then leave them to their own device. Later when she went to Meereen she decided to stay longer, so that she could not make the same mistake that she did in Astapor. She ended slavery, crucified the master (burning every bridge and chance to ever have peace with the leaders of Meereen) destroyed the local economy and brought the city to their knees. Yes, ending slavery is a good thing, but it needs to be a lifelong decision, not a 6 project. She once again destroy what used to be a rich and prosper city. 

She then is taken as a captive by the Dothraki and while there she is strong enough to save herself, she kills all the Khals and literally BURN DOWN the temple and conquers all the Dothrakis. Daenerys “Blood and Fire” is the only way she is able to conquer. That’s is her gift and her tragedy!!!!

Daenerys is a good woman, with a kind and gentle heart, but she is also utterly incompetent when it comes to ruling. She had no formal education, her mentor was cruel Viserys. Her advisors are morally corrupted men that want either use her or sleep with her. Add to that the fact that she is hot headed and can be blind by anger. Her decision to burn down the Tallys will have a bad consequences, just like crucifying the masters in Meereen did. 


In the end of season 6, when Daenerys returned to Mereen, she wanted, and I quote:

&gt; “I will crucify the masters, I will set their fleet afire, kill every one of their soldiers and return the city to the dirty”.

It was Tyrion who convinced her that there was a better way that involved less carnage and death. Then as soon as she arrived in Westeros she mentioned that if Viserys was alive he would already burned down KL and taken the Iron Throne, Tyrion once again remind her that she was not in Westeros to be the queen of the ashes. Then as soon as her plans all failed and she lost her allies she once again wanted to use the dragons to take the Throne and destroy her enemies, this time it was Jon Snow who stopped her and proposed another plan. 

A Queen that has to be restrained over and over about burning down the country is not fit to rule and no, I don’t think Jon will calm her down (he is the ice to her fire, the fuck), this is a stupid idea. **The show is trying to show us that Daenerys is not fit to rule the Seven Kingdoms. She is short sighted, when Tyrion wanted to discuss succession she got mad at him and snapped, because this is a painful topic to her since she believes to be barren, showing once again that she is not mature enough to rule; She burned down the Tallys (just like her father burned down Richard Stark and his son); burned down the food from Highgarden; lost allies and in the end of the season she was literally ignoring her advisers and going with Jon Snow ideas because she was infatuated by him (again, not a good sign for a ruler).**

 Daenerys journey in Essos was made by destruction, pure and simple. Yes she had good intentions, but the consequences of her actions were disastrous. Thats why I think her character will take a turn in season 8. Her armies are not ready for the winter, she already lost one dragon and the Lords are not gonna love her and bend their knees at her sight. The cast is doing interviews about season 8 and most of them is telling that ""this wont end like people are expecting to end"". The audience left season 7 with Jon and Dany having sex and looking in love, I dont think this is how its going to end. I think they are preapring a twist for the audience.

[EVERYTHING] - In the defense of Tywin Lannister,"I always liked Tywin, he did some cruel stuff but I always found his motivation behind it pretty understandable. However I never really could excuse his hatred and mistreating for Tyrion. Tywin always said it was because Tyrion killed his wife at birth, but that felt like a weak excuse and like his real reason was that he just hated him for being a dwarf. However when watching some stuff back Tywin said the following:
'Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse'
This explained so much for me. I know that there are theories that Tyrion is actually the product of Aerys Targaryen raping Tywins wife, but this was never confirmed. But Tywin saying that he cannot prove Tyrion is not his confirmed that he himself is suspicious that Aerys is probably Tyrions father. And that suddenly makes it so clear why Tywin hates Tyrion. Just imagine after being laughed at most of your life, having a deformed child that you not only know will be the laughing stock of your family and killed your beloved wife at birth but also is probably not even yours, but then when instead of letting the child die, you raise him as your own and he doesn't even try to be a good son and goes around whoring and getting drunk whenever he wants.",gameofthrones,True,1515962085,2018-01-14

It got me thinking about what a sphinx is. In the book I believe its part human, lion, and hawk.

What if the three headed dragon is more of a metaphor. I think Daenerys loses another dragon before the end of the series.

I think three charactors with with three different beasts will make the three headed dragon.

I think two of the three is Daenerys with her dagon, Jon with his Dyre wolf. I just dont know what the third would be.

Diplomacy breaks down and the different trios of kingsguard draw their weapons to defend their leaders in an all out battle. This is a hypothetical so humor the various impossibilities/continuity errors. 

Team 1: Tywin’s guard consists of pre-zombie Gregor Clegane, two handed Jaime, and Bronn. 
T2: Daenerys’ guard is Greyworm, Jorah and Daario. 
T3: Jon’s guard consists of himself, Brienne and The Hound (they were all assembled at the dragon pit in season 7 playing for the same team so that’s why I put them together)
T4: Oberyn and his three daughters, the sand snakes, will be defending their king. 
T5: Khal Drogo shows up with his 2 best bloodriders.

[EVERYTHING] Why Are We Not Talking About the Possibility of a Political Marriage Between Jon Snow and His Cousin Sansa Stark?,"Having a Targaryen prince marrying a Stark girl, for duty not love, in order to rebuild and reunite the Kingdom that was destroyed by the war caused by Rheagar and Lyanna romance would be very fitting. 


I know that this couple causes a lot of drama here in the forums, but yes, we have to talk about the chances of a political marriage between Jon and Sansa. Ned Stark marriage to Catelyn was a political move did by duty, to united House Stark and House Tully, uniting Riverlands and North, mind you, because Cat had a sister that married Jon Arryn, the marriage end up uniting also North and Vale, something that its being very useful in the past seasons. And looks at that, Ned and Cat marriage turned out to be one of the most loving and healthy relationship in the books and show, producing 5 well-adjusted kids. 


The show has been hitting at the parallels between Jon and Sansa and Ned and Cat this past season; we saw Jon Snow  leave Winterfell to go find allies for the fight against the Army of the Dead while Sansa was left ruling the castle and taking care of the North and mind you, they make sure to show that she is doing a fine good job.
Sansa was caring about food supplies, armors, soldier’s vestments, provisions, not to mention she was quite good at calming the High Lords about their concerns over the KITN. This is all duties of a Queen and remember in the books she said it: If I am ever Queen I am make them love me. She is doing that, the Lords of the Vale and North all love her.

Jon would be a charismatic leader that unites the Kingdom and Sansa would be his consort Queen with experience in the Game of Thrones. They would be great for Westeros. Uniting House Targaryen with House Stark, North and South, bringing peace and stability to the Kingdom.


I know that after season 7 finale everybody  keeps on thinking that Jon and Dany will end up together in the end of the show, but several actors now have given interviews telling people that the end is not what people are expecting.

If Asshai is a great port city, there has to be something to the east of it, and it would have to be pretty big for it to be so great.

[EVERYTHING] HBO Confirms Game of Thrones Revival Will Never Happen,"Speaking to THR, HBO programming president Casey Bloys has promised that the show will not continue in its current form beyond its final season and that the network will never return to the Game of Thrones idea:

“That’s not happening. This story, A Song of Ice and Fire, is done. There’s no revival, reboot, spinoff talk.”

It is a double-edged sword, but there is a sense of reassurance that Game of Thrones will be preserved as is. However, even with HBO vowing to leave show where it ends, that won’t stop some far-off rights buyout and a different network remaking the story a la Lord of the Rings in a hypothetical future.

[Everything] Is Game of Thrones like real life?,"All right folks, tighten your boot straps and get ready for the craziest most ignorant question of your dang lives: is Game of Thrones anything like real life back in the medieval times?

""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and your handle is dumb too. Your question is bad and you should feel bad.""

Listen you aren't telling me anything I don't already know, but bear with me. I'm in season one of Game of Thrones (and loving it), and OBVIOUSLY a world of zombies, magic, dragon eggs, etc. is not indicative of good old Earth Prime. However, Game of Thrones has a certain.... unique feel to the community that goes beyond the mystical. Between the political structures, the judicial branches (or lack thereof), the roles of males and females, the interactions of the townspeople to the respective authority, the general community feel, the push to get married at 13, the general mannerisms of the people, etc... I would find myself thinking, huh, I wonder if the culmination of all of these things is what it really used to be like, or if this is an exaggeration or, even crazier, UNDER-exaggeration of the general feel and attitude of the time. 

Anyway, that's just a dumb question from your average internet user. ",gameofthrones,True,1516058487,2018-01-15

At the siege of Newbury castle, William, a young boy, was taken hostage by King Stephen to prevent his father from attacking. The king threatened to launch the boy from a trebuchet towards William's castle like Jaime threatened to Edmure. In both the show and history, the threat was definitely a bluff.

2) Telling her he thinks her pregnancy is faked: ""I don't believe you, there isn't another.""

"[EVERYTHING] Until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear...... I have a new theory on the Queen prophecy!!!!","It cant be Daenerys, is literally impossible to be her. Is Sansa Stark, I have no doubts anymore. The prophecy said that ""until it comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear. **We can summarize all Cersei holds dear in 4 points: her kids, her father, her lover and her power and crown.** I think we can agree that Cersei's kids, Jaime, Tywin and her power are the most important things in her life. 

 

Its literally impossible for Daenerys to be the queen in the prophecy, because she had nothing to do with Cersei's children's death or Tywin death and she also had nothing to do with Jaime leaving Cersei, this happens in the books wayyyy before Daenerys arrives in Westeros. Unless we are now pretending that Jofrey, Myrcella, Tommen, Tywin and Jaime are not things that Cersei holds dear and **I can not do that, that would be to ignore everything that the books have been telling us, or even the  tv show.**

 

It was Sansa who was brave enought to tell  Olenna Tyrell that Jofrey was a monster, after that Olenna organized for him to be murdered because she didnt  wanted Margeary to be married to him, that unleashed a chain reaction causing Cersei to lose all her children and her father. Jofrey trial caused Oberyn Martell to be killed in the Trial by combat fight against the Montain, which will eventually  lead to Myrcella death, the trial also causes Tywin to be murdered by his own son Tyrion (after he was wrongly accused of killing Joffrey). Later Tommen marries Margeary (because Jofrey was killed) making Cersei very worried and paranoid, which will bring down the Tyrells and Tommen himself. All because Joffrey was poisoned. 

 

Cersei is also going to lose Jaime to Sansa, remember that was because he made a promise to Catelyn Stark to return her daughters safe and alive to Winterfell that he met Brienne, and that relationship changed Jaime forever and made his affair with Cersei even more strained. In the books they are already separated way before what happens in season 7 and he mentions in one of his chapters in the books  **“Sansa Stark is my last chance for Honor”** . I now believe that he will ride North alone in season 8 and pledge himself to Sansa, offering his services to her. 

Sansa will marry her cousin Aegon Targaryen (I will talk more about this later) and in the end she and Arya will take the North, Vale and Riverland armies down south to get back the Iron Throne defeating Cersei and taking finally all the things she holds dear.

 

Cersei belongs to Sansa and Arya, she has no connection to Daenerys what so ever, Dany bringing down Cersei and the Lannisters would had no emotion payout for the audience, But the Starks girls?  after all Cersei had  done to them? After killing Lady? Killing Ned Stark?  torturing Sansa?  plotting and celebrating the Red Wedding? After trying to destroy House Stark for years??? 

 

Sansa Stark is the Queen, more beautiful, younger, who will cast Cersei down taking EVERYTHING she holds dear. BTW in the pilot in season 1, the very first thing Cersei says to Sansa after meeting her? ""What a beauty"" ",gameofthrones,True,1516115298,2018-01-16

[EVERYTHING] Game of Thrones: Liam Cunningham Didn’t Originally Audition for Davos,"HBO’s Game of Thrones boasts one of the most impressive rosters of actors on television – which is almost perfectly cast – but series regular Liam Cunningham has revealed that he didn’t originally audition for the role of Ser Davos Seaworth.

It is hard to imagine anyone other than the likes of Kit Harington or Emilia Clarke in their respective roles, and Cunningham’s part as Ser Davos is no exception. First appearing in the second season of the ice and fire epic, Ser Davos served as the loyal right-hand man of Stannis Baratheon. While Davos’ former employer and many other characters have been sent to an early grave on the show, Cunningham has survived the War of the Five Kings to become a major player in the show’s endgame.

However, even with Cunningham’s gruff sailor being a hardened survivor of the series, it all could’ve been so different. Speaking to GQ, the 56-year-old revealed that Ser Davos wasn’t the first role he set his sights on:

 “They said the old thing: ‘We’re going to go another way. But: We’ve got more characters coming in Season Two, and we want to see you.’ And I went, ‘Yeah, yeah. This is Hollywood letting me down politely.’ But sure enough, they came back.”

Upon being questioned about his sexual orientation, Varys claims that he has no interest in such matters. He concludes that ""the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."" Upon saying this he also stares casually at the Iron Throne. My initial reaction was to believe that he was hinting at his own desire to to take the Iron Throne for himself. However, after watching the following seasons I now realize that he never intended to sit on the Iron Throne. His comment to Prince Oberyn was linked to his desire to see someone *worthy* sit on the Iron Throne. ",gameofthrones,True,1516172308,2018-01-17

[BOOKS] Old Valyria....Dangers and Rewards,"I need some lore (show and book) savvy felliw GOT fans. Lets say you are (hopefully never) thrown into the world of A song of ice and fire. Skint broke, you hatch a plan to take the treasures of the Valyrian freehold as your own. You (somehow) manage to get a ship (on loan....or for laughs you steal Euron Greyjoys ship while his on land), you get a crew willing to sail you there (they must be high on that new Dothraki bush weed to actually take you near Old Valyria) and you arrive with no sea based accidents.

My questions should be easy to you guys. So here there are. Question 1-

What dangers are you facing there? Stone men being one of them, what else? I hear that the doom of Valyria was volcanic in nature, so poisonous gas and fumes? Molten lava? Scary GOT mythological creatures? (excepting dragons since they're all dead)

And question 2...what are the rewards?

So you survived all that ( God from our world must be really liking you, you know it ain't Rhill'or or The drowned god helping your ass out. And the Old gods be loving the stark club only.) What are the rewards?

Gold? Dragon eggs? Method to forging valyrian steel? Resurrected Targaryen Waifu? ;) White walker flame Bugspray?

(At this point walking out of there with a few trinkets and moving to essos would be a blessing.)

[Everything] Sansa's Marriage,"In the books and the show, Sansa is supposed to marry Joffrey, then gets put aside as he marries Marjorie, but Sansa is married off to Tyrion. As Tyrion is actually a nice person, he refuses to bed his wife until she says he can, so it's unconsummated as she disappears off after Joffrey's wedding and the subsequent fun.

Here's where it gets difficult... In the show, she is then married to Ramsey, but in the books, that part is taken by Jayne Poole, her childhood friend, who is brought out as Arya to seal the Bolton's hold on the North, so technically, Sansa is still married to Tyrion anyway. Either way, with Ramsey's death in the show, and Sansa not being married to him in the first place in the books, she's still legally married to Tyrion.

I keep thinking that Sansa and Tyrion would make an extraordinarily powerful couple if they got it together, not only because of their respective inheritances (since Bran doesn't want to take up the role of Lord Stark of Winterfell), but because of the way their characters are as people. I do think that without Sansa second guessing every nice thing Tyrion does for her, as she did in the past, wondering if it was a trap to get her to say or do something that could be considered ""treasonous"", she could actually come to enjoy being his wife.

I personally would like to see them reconcile in the last series. Anyone else feel the same?",gameofthrones,True,1516189446,2018-01-17

I need more opinions, so i'm doing a lil bit survey here. Thanks for your help.

p.s.2 : Any other idea what should be included in this presentation? and anyone know good source for statistic about fandom,fictional characters and stuff? are they exist? i need inspiration

[NO SPOILERS] How much does the tv show differ from the books?,"I've watched all the season of game of thrones but just started reading the first book, I was wondering how much the TV show stuck to the original story",gameofthrones,True,1516217945,2018-01-17
[EVERYTHING] Theories/Predictions on Sansa Stark,"Now I will be honest I was not a huge fan of Sansa when she first appeared in S1, Now I did not out right hate her character (for the most part) and it was hard to watch her be tormented by the Lannisters (minus Tyrion) and the Boltons but she was always my least favorite out of the stark children mainly because she always seemed like a pawn rather then a player. That was until S6 and S7 where she started to become more independent and seemed like an actual player in the Game of Thrones and I far cry from what she was in S1 (except for that S5 but we don't talk about that....Like...Ever), But how will her story end.

Now I did do something like this already with Arya but unlike Arya it's alittle easier to pinpoint where Sansa's story could end since her endgame is not a enigma as much as Arya's is but she still has some possibilities so let's take a look:

1. She dies- Now this one is a divisive option, Some people think it will happen while others no so much I fit in the category of people who don't think she'll die for a lot of reasons but mainly because it would make her entire arc and storyline a complete waste of time. That being said if done right it could work and in my opinion if it did happen here is how I think it would play out. There is only room for one more person for the wagons that will escort the Stark children so Sansa gives it to Arya (or Gendry if Arya already found a spot and Arya and Gendry hooked up at this point) and she chooses to stay at WF (a captain goes down with the ship situation), and she is killed by the NK.

2. Night Queen- On the other hand it is possible the NK could turn her into his Night Queen or if Jon makes a pact he could have to marry Sansa to the NK and have her become the Night Queen. Now I don't think any of that will happen either nor do I think there will be a Night Queen at this point and if there is I think it will probably be Cersei.

3. Queen in the North- Now this one makes the most sense as it has been set up the most, It does not seem like she wants to go back up South anytime soon, and she wants it anyways and I believe she could be queen in the north by the end if she is not queen of the Seven Kingdoms (weather or not she marries again, Well that is a different story). A lot of people are starting to think Arya could be Queen of the North but I think it will be Sansa.

4. Queen of the Seven Kingdoms- If Arya, Jon, or Gendry don't become rulers of Seven Kingdoms at the end then Sansa may be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Because out of all the people besides Arya who deserve the throne the most after what they've been through it is Sansa (Especially if Jon and Dany are not alive at the end and if Arya does not get the throne). There is actually a lot of forshadowing for this in the books with it paralleling the real Virgin queen of England. Now yes she is not a virgin in the show but that does not change the fact she could still be queen in the show.

5. She marries Podrick- Yes I am not joking either. Now a lot of people think she will marry Tyrion or the Hound I don't think her bound with the Hound was Romantic bound I think it was more of a brother/sister bound or a father and daughter bound like with Arya. As for Tyrion well they may be friends and I think Sansa does care for him in that way but I don't think they will re-marry. Some people think she will be with Jon but that is just fanfiction, In my opinion I think if she should be with anybody it should be Pod because she has always wanted to fall in the love with a Prince and I could not have gone worse for her, So if she found true healthy love in the form of a squire I think it would be ironic, show how much she has changed as a character, and overall be a fitting end.",gameofthrones,True,1516218335,2018-01-17
[EVERYTHING]Something that King Robert said at the very beginning that kind of put a major event at the end of S7 in perspective for me,"I don't remember if he says anything to this extent in the show, but in the first book when Robert first comes to Winterfell, it goes like this - Ned wants Robert to see the Wall, and Robert says: 

""The Wall has stood for what, eight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns.""

First, it just made me chuckle, because I pictured someone saying that the day before the NK blew it down at the end of S7. But it also made me realize that aside from most people not believing in the white walkers, most people take the Wall for granted. To most of Westeros, it really is an impenetrable force and most people can't even comprehend a situation where the Wall would come down. 

As readers/watchers, we know that the Wall would eventually come down. We've seen the white walkers, and because it's a fantasy story, we know that it will eventually end in a huge conflict. I knew that the Wall coming down was a big deal, but at the same time I knew it was coming, because that's where the story was headed. But ""in universe"", it's a _huge_ deal because people couldn't ever picture it coming down. It was just a really interesting moment that I wanted to share!",gameofthrones,True,1516218852,2018-01-17
[MAIN SPOILERS] Thoughts on Heroism,"Thoughts on Heroism

I think GoT works so well in some regards because we want, need, crave a hero of the story but we are never given one. All of the villains make us long for a hero but all of our heroes are chopped down or shown as flawed to some degree. This is the reverse of the well rounded villain who achieves redemption or has a slither of a good side underneath its the hero we want to root for but the harshness of Westeros shows every hero has a flaw, a dark side or a weakness.

To see our heroes as human with flaws, bad decisions and bad luck makes their triumph ultimately seem more real and more identifiable with

In essence it asks the question who is more heroic. The superhero or the Flawed Hero",gameofthrones,True,1516221267,2018-01-17

And 

* What do you think his chances would be like?",gameofthrones,True,1516291722,2018-01-18
[Everything] What was Robb doing there anyway?,"**Real Title: Why was Robb fighting a war in the first place?**

After being declared The King in the North, what did Robb have to gain by fighting a war. What justification is there for not simply returning back to the North. There's virtually no risk of being attacked, as I don't think Tywin would be fool enough to cross the neck. And I don't think a northern Siege of King's Landing was ever in the cards so rescuing his sisters was never going to happen. In fact, I'd say his best chances for getting his sister's back would be to sue for peace with a hostage exchange. Sure the Lannisters wanted the North but especially in S2 with virtually no allies, I think giving up the north in exchange for Jaime and one less front to fight sounds like a pretty good shake.

Robb said at different times that it's not for revenge, glory, not want of the Iron Throne, so what then? Justice? OK maybe that's feasible at the start when all the major houses are aligned against the Lannisters. But how about after Robb fails to make any strong allies beyond the Tullys? When the Baratheons destroy themselves, the Tyrells switch sides, and the Ironborne attack their home? What the hell is he doing down there? Is it really just that he's so green that he thinks he can probably still handle the South because of his battle record? And that he cares about Justice so much he's determined to see this through?

Some justifications I can think of: (1) Maybe he stays fighting because he believes once he travels North and his bannerman return to their homes that it would be too difficult to unify them again when Tywin marches North? or (2) That his going North will separate him from the Tully portion of the army and they'll get wiped or never be able to join again? So essentially just fighting for the reason of keeping the army together? Does anyone have a better explanation? I really think when the Greyjoys attacked he should have rallied to the North as he stands to gain very little in the South at this point beyond protecting the Riverlands from The Mountain.",gameofthrones,True,1516292466,2018-01-18

2. Losing his chance to ambush Gregor Clegane by not informing Edmure Tully of his intentions
3. Emboldening the Greyjoy's invasion of the North by sending Theon, their hostage, as the envoy
4. Putting too much trust in the Boltons despite his mother's warnings
5. Losing much of his army by beheading Rickard Karstark
6. Allowing Jaime Lannister to escape multiple times (the books and shows have slightly different reasons why this happened and Cat's betrayal was somewhat unexpected despite her urging, but this should never have been allowed to happen as this prisoner was one of his biggest cards)
7. The lack of a stronger response to the Greyjoy's attack on his homelands (I suppose this coincides with #4)

The book and show start with White Walkers throwing their weight around, was this just because the Nights Watch had gone too far north into their territory? But then what triggers the push forward from the ""Night King""? 

Or did they just get to a stage where the army was big enough to start moving south?

There are so many questions that I don't think the show will answer. And that's not a dig against the show, I love it but there is only so much they can do without over complicating things of having too many loose ends to explain/tie up by the end.

Loras Tyrell’s surprisingly MAJOR impact on the overall plot of the entire series,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1516322063,2018-01-18
[EVERYTHING] Loras Tyrell’s surprisingly MAJOR impact on the overall plot of the entire series,"Looking back, so many things would have gone drastically differently if it weren’t for the minor plot point of Loras’ sexuality and his relationship with Renly.

-**Loras is the one who first suggests to Renly that he should be king.** Renly initially argues to him that he’s 4th in line for the throne and has an older brother. Loras convinces him that this shouldn’t stop him because he would be a good, fair ruler and he would be adored by his subjects.

-**Loras’ relationship with Renly resulted in the Renly/Margaery marriage.** Loras probably sold the idea to Mace that Margaery should marry Renly to support his claim to the throne, because if he was successful (very possible with the Tyrell support) she would be Queen. This would be best case scenario for Loras and Renly to be together, because Margaery knew of their relationship and was fine with being in a sham marriage considering it meant she got to be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Olenna disagreed but clearly the men got their way.

-**After Renly dies, Loras is heartbroken and joins the battle against Stannis - his lover’s killer.** Stannis would have won the Battle of Blackwater if the Tyrells hadn’t joined the Lannisters. This point alone alters the entire story:

* Northern rebellion dies down/ends, no Red Wedding, no more Stark death;

* Sansa probably allowed to go home, her life drastically improves;

* Arya eventually hears the war is over and makes her way home;

* Cersei and her children killed (Stannis probably kills Cersei and Joffrey… Cersei would have already poisoned Tommen…. Maybe Stannis lets Myrcella live/maybe not). However, maybe Jamie and/or Tyrion find a way to not get killed by some plot twist.

-All that aside, another Loras impact is that **the buzz of his marriage to Sansa results in the Lannisters marrying Sansa to Tyrion.** (I realize in the books its another Tyrell brother, but for the show, this applies). So if Loras wasn’t going to marry Sansa, she might not have been forced into her marriage with Tyrion as a Lannister counter-move. And, her marriage to Tyrion linked her to the Joffrey murder, so everything about her escape might have gone down differently or not happened.

-Finally, **Loras’ homosexuality led to his, and then Margaery’s arrests, which ends in their deaths** (and the annihilation of the entire Tyrell house), which results in Tommen killing himself, making Cersei Queen. The remainder of the impact of Cersei being Queen is still TBD.

I think it's pretty impressive and interesting for a relatively background character to have made such an unintentional impact over 6 seasons of the show.",gameofthrones,True,1516322526,2018-01-18
[EVERYTHING] Two of the missing links in the Bran/NK theory possibly explained.,"Hey everyone. I suppose a lot of you are familiar with the theory that Bran is the Night King. If you're not, here's a quick TL;DR.

The theory goes, that Bran accidentally became the Night King, trying to save the world from the White Walkers. He warged into the into the human who later will become the Night King, and due to the fact he's gone too far into the past, for too long, he's stuck there. The quote supporting that is “It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, you’ll drown.”


Now! That's a really really basic overview of the theory, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6vifi4/main_spoilers_the_brannk_theory_explained/) is a great post explaining the ins and outs of the theory, quotes included. BUT, I'm assuming you, the reader, know the theory in all it's entirety and I'm now going to address some of the main missing links from the theory!


MISSING LINK 1 - Why didn't Bran just kill himself when he became the Night King?

A quote from Meera in S4E2 says - Bran will ""forget what it's like to be human."" if he wargs too long. She goes further to say he'll forget his friends, family and Winterfell etc. The 3ER also seconds this, but with less detail. This could be what happened, Bran's mental state completely deteriorated when he became the NK, due to having warged too long, or the magic of becoming the NK corrupting his mind. 


The supporting evidence as to why the NK is Bran, is how the NK knew exactly where young Bran was going to be in one of the first visions, to mark him at exactly the correct time. Then another time, when the NK seemingly lets Jon Snow free at Hardhome. This could be the Bran in the NK being awakened slightly, causing inner conflict.


MISSING LINK 2 - ""The ink is dry"".


""The ink is dry"". The line from the 3ER that possibly corrupts this entire theory. The past cannot be changed, according the 3ER Number 1. However Bran is special. Bran isn't like Jojen or the 3ER. He's a warg AND a greensee-er. He turns Wyllis into Hodor and makes his father look at the tower of joy. It could be a point of interest.



I really only glossed over these because it's 1am and I'm excited. The Bran=NK theory could be complete BS. But I think it makes sense, and is a great plot twist. There's loads more hints and stuff that could explain it but I'm too tired to write them all, feel free to rip me to shreds in the comments, add more to the theory or just be your usual jolly selves.",gameofthrones,True,1516324262,2018-01-18

[MAIN SPOILERS]A theory on the Wall's real magical powers,"Theory: Wall's magical power has something to do with the horn. 

So at the end of Season 6 Benjen told Bran that the Wall has powerful magic that prevents wights from coming across the wall, but Jon and co. brought a wight to King's Landing in S7 and the wight was perfectly fine south of the Wall, therefore we can probably assume that the magic wasn't like a invisible barrier like the one at 3er's cave that kills everything dead going through it. (or maybe Daenerys flying past the wall doesn't count as ""going through it"")

However, at the very end of S7 when the army of the dead finally reached the wall, and the night's watch and wildlings blew the horn three times, every single one of the wights stopped in place immediately after the third blast. If you look closely, not one of them moved at all until the night king emerged from the deep forest and melted down a huge chunk of the wall.

Therefore, I believe the wall's real magic was that three continual blasts of horns would freeze every wight that heard it. I mean, why else would the nights watch have a specific ancient rule to blow the horn 3 times for wights when 2 blasts serves an essentially same function as 3 blasts if not for the magical effect.

TLDR: The Wall's real power is that blowing the horn three times would freeze every single wight nearby that heard it. ",gameofthrones,True,1516335477,2018-01-18

[EVERYTHING] On Arya and Cersei's intertwined fates,"Hello /r/gameofthrones,

I am going to present to you, both show and books, why Arya and Cersei's fates are intertwined.  Or why Arya, not Jaime, is going to kill Cersei.  I have split it into three parts, the first post is the foreshadowing in the show while the last two posts are the instances of foreshadowing, prophecy, and such in the books. The first part is basically a simple show version of my theory, so you can just do part one and be done with it.  But if you like it or would want more detail, then you can read the in-depth analysis of the books in the last two parts of this post.

Before anyone says anything, D&amp;D have said that they are going to end the show the same way as the books.  I use the analogy of the interstate and highway: they wander different paths but they can take you to the same destination.

____

#Part I: Show Evidence for Arya killing Cersei

____

Before we get started, there are two things from the books you must know: the valonqar and lightbringer.  Lightbringer is the sword the Prince that was Promised will wield while fighting against the Great Other (Night King and his company) while valonqar is ""Little Brother"" in High Valyrian and comes from the prophecy Maggy the Frog gave to Cersei.  [The show version does not actually say anything about valonqar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6kQJ9HPpQ4).  And the show does not say much about the Legend of Lightbringer. But the important parts about the prophecy and the Legend are:

&gt;___

&gt;[PROPHECY]:  ""Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds,"" she said. ""**And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you**.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

&gt;___

&gt;[LEGEND]: Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. **Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart**, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;___

Now you have the context, here is the evidence in the show that Arya is going to kill Cersei.

1\. [Syrio Forel trained Arya by catching cats.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUjPBtlhBls)

 - This actually has more depth in it in the books.  Arya has been described on numerous occasions as a rat and she has self-described herself as a mouse. [Here's an image with most of the references](https://imgur.com/a/bp3OF).  A Lannister lion = cat. Thus the old cat-and-mouse literary trope.  This goes even further with the fact that the Hound is a dog.  So you have the triad of cat, rat/mouse, and a dog.

2\. [The Hound taught Arya how to euthanize someone by showing her where to find the heart with the dagger](https://youtu.be/EroNA0WdIww?t=31)

 - Maester Lewin was euthanized the same way. The show doesn't give a name to the act of euthanizing someone by stabbing him/her in the heart, but in the books it is referred to as [""the Gift of Mercy""](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gift_of_mercy).

3\. [Jon Snow's First Lesson to Arya ties to number 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFdu_lvCTJA)

 - ""Stick em with the pointy end"" - This is, in fact, [one of two of GRRM's favorite lines in the books/TV show](https://today.tamu.edu/2013/03/22/author-george-r-r-martin-is-visiting-texas-am-talks-game-of-thrones-and-texas-am-libraries/)

4\. [Arya was sent on a redemption mission the kill the actor who played Cersei Lannister](https://youtu.be/rz9HviABPgE?t=39) (The Important part is 0:39-3:30)

 - Arya gives Lady Crane advise on how to play Cersei.  Lady Crane asks for her name and Arya says ""mercy""

5\. [For Hands of Gold Are Always Cold But a Woman's Hands are...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BOneWHLaPQ&amp;t=2s)

 - When Ed Sheeran sings the refrain with the rest of the Lannister men ""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm"" they sing it again ""For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are..."" and they stop to look at Arya. The song comes from the books and is a song that is used to blackmail Tyrion.  It is a song about him visiting Shae at Chataya's, and the singer threatens to sing the song to Cersei and Tywin. The hands of gold in the refrain refers to the chain of the hand that is a link of golden hands [which Tyrion used to strangle Shae](http://quizinsight.com/images/how-would-you-die-in-game-of-thrones/strangled600.jpg).  But, given an outside look, when referred to ""golden hands"" not only can it refer to the Chain of the Hand, but also Jaime's golden hand.  And the scene with Arya, Ed Sheeran, and the rest of the Lannister soldiers with Arya saying **""I'm going to kill the queen""**.

Arya is going to give Cersei the gift of mercy by plunging Widow's Wail (Jaime's sword) *as* Jaime. Needle or the catspaw dagger would also work here.  The whole series, in fact, started off with Ned giving Cersei mercy in hope that she would save her children from Robert's wrath.

____

#Part II: Arya as Ned's Mercy

&gt;____

&gt;What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey's birth?"" 

&gt;[Varys asked]

&gt;""**The madness of mercy**,"" Ned admitted.

&gt; - Eddard XV

&gt;____

&gt;""A very skilled assassin.""

&gt;""There are such. I used to dream that one day I'd be rich enough to send a Faceless Man after my sweet sister.""

&gt; - Tyrion X ACoK

&gt;____

The show Ned goes on to elaborate the unspoken truth of why he gave Cersei: that it was to save her children. When Ned stumbled upon the truth while reading *the Lineages and Histories of the Great Seven Houses of the Seven Kingdoms*:

&gt;____

&gt;Yet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegar’s children. Lord Tywin had laid the bodies beneath the Iron Throne, wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard. That was clever of him; the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth. The little princess had been barefoot, still dressed in her bed gown, and the boy…the boy…

&gt;Ned could not let that happen again. The realm could not withstand a second mad king, another dance of blood and vengeance. He must find some way to save the children.”

&gt;Robert could be merciful. Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned. Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys the Spider, Lord Balon Greyjoy; each had been counted an enemy to Robert once, and each had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty. So long as a man was brave and honest, Robert would treat him with all the honor and respect due a valiant enemy.

&gt;This was something else: poison in the dark, a knife thrust to the soul. This he could never forgive, no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar. *He will kill them all*, Ned realized.

&gt; - Eddard XII

&gt;____

Ned could not keep the truth secret, yet he had fear of what Robert will do of Cersei's children once Ned told Robert. So Ned gave mercy to Cersei, hoping that she would flee for the children. Robert then was gravely injured because of Cersei's plotting and ends up dying before Ned could tell him the truth.  Ned then presents Robert's will to Cersei, after having it witnessed by Ser Barristan, and Cersei refuses to give and ends up getting Ned imprisoned which would result in him being imprisoned and then beheaded.

Re-reading Ned's chapters, protecting children is a strong theme very likely because of Tywin's ""presents"" of the two slaughtered bodies of the Targaryen children to Robert.  Ned protects Jon by taking him in as a bastard child of his, he tries to protect Daenerys by protesting Robert's decision to assassinate her, and he calls for justice when Tywin presented the dead children of Rhaegar Targaryen.

Additionally, there is a theme with Ned trying to give justice but failing.  At the sack of King's Landing, Ned wanted to bring Tywin to justice.  But Robert refused. When Jaime slaughtered Ned's men, Ned wanted to bring justice to Jaime.  But Robert refused.  When Ser Gregor burned, raped, and slaughtered in Wendish Town and Mummer's Ford, Ned Stark sent Ser Beric Dondarrion to bring justice to him by sentencing him to die.  Yet again, justice has yet been brought.  And lastly, when Ned Stark found out about the truth of Cersei, Jaime, and their children, he confronts Cersei and tells her she needs to leave before Robert's wrath kills them:

&gt;___

&gt;How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood, he could not say. It was peaceful here. The thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle, and he could hear birds singing, the murmur of crickets, leaves rustling in a gentle wind. The heart tree was an oak, brown and faceless, yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of his gods. His leg did not seem to hurt so much.

&gt;She came to him at sunset, as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers. She came alone, as he had bid her.

&gt;“Why here?” Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him.

&gt;“**So the gods can see**.”

&gt; - Eddard XII AGoT

&gt;____

Robert is gravely injured, dies, and Ned brings Robert's will to Cersei which she promptly shreds to bits.  Ned tries to bring justice to Cersei and Joffrey, but is betrayed, imprisoned, and later beheaded.

Ned has plenty of parallels with the Father in the Faith of the Seven, whom has a beard on a long and stern face and is prayed for for judgement, justice, and when to recognize it.  But, I believe the show provides the description that fits the theme: the Father's Divine Justice.  Arya, one of the two people who has experienced Ned Stark's beheading as well as the Red Wedding, is going to deliver the justice Ned tried to bring Cersei. Except it is not going to be a vengeful Arya, but one who gives the Gift of Mercy. But how? The valonqar prophecy states that it is the *little brother* that will kill Cersei.  Tyrion knows of Maegor Targaryen's tunnels in the Red Keep and Arya knows the ways of the faceless men.  Jaime will inevitably die, by justice or by battle:

&gt;___

&gt;That night Tyrion Lannister dreamed of a battle that turned the hills of Westeros as red as blood. He was in the midst of it, dealing death with an axe as big as he was, fighting side by side with Barristan the Bold and Bittersteel as dragons wheeled across the sky above them. In the dream he had two heads, both noseless. His father led the enemy, so he slew him once again. Then he killed his brother, Jaime, **hacking at his face until it was a red ruin**, laughing every time he struck a blow. Only when the fight was finished did he realize that his second head was weeping.

&gt; - Tyrion II ADwD

&gt;_____

The Lannister dreams are very important, there are four:

&gt; Jaime VI ASoS

&gt;Cersei I AFfC

&gt;Jaime VI AFfC 

&gt;Tyrion II ADwD

Jaime's second dream reveals how their father never liked being laughed at. Tywin made sure to put an end to the mockery of House Lannister that his father, Tytos set themselves up to.  Tywin did not want the family to be laughed at, and in Jaime's dream Joanna Lannister made it clear *twice* that people laughing at the family was something he hated.  Which is why you see the laughing head in Tyrion's dream. Him laughing at his father's wishes, and the face that is crying that is probably the more literal aspect of Tyrion's emotions of his brother dying.

One will have to take my word for it, else he or she will have to sift through numerous quotes in asearchoficeandfire, when I say that there is a strong connection with Arya, rats, and mice.  (Note: Lannister Lion = cat. Thus the old cat and rat literary trope). The mice bit is usually Arya calling herself that, while others have called her a rat on *numerous* occasions. 

In Cersei's dream:

&gt;_____

&gt;She dreamt she sat the Iron Throne, high above them all.

&gt;**The courtiers were brightly colored mice below**. Great lords and proud ladies knelt before her. Bold young knights laid their swords at her feet and pleaded for her favors, and the queen smiled down at them. Until the dwarf appeared as if from nowhere, pointing at her and howling with laughter. The lords and ladies began to chuckle too, hiding their smiles behind their hands. Only then did the queen realize she was naked.

&gt;Horrified, she tried to cover herself with her hands. The barbs and blades of the Iron Throne bit into her flesh as she crouched to hide her shame. Blood ran red down her legs, as steel teeth gnawed at her buttocks. When she tried to stand, her foot slipped through a gap in the twisted metal. The more she struggled the more the throne engulfed her, tearing chunks of flesh from her breasts and belly, slicing at her arms and legs until they were slick and red, glistening.
And all the while her brother capered below, laughing.

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;____

She then wakes up and finds out about Maegor's tunnels:

&gt;____

&gt;Her twin's face had a haggard look. ""The shaft goes down to a chamber where half a dozen tunnels meet. They're closed off by iron gates, chained and locked. I need to find keys."" He glanced around the bedchamber. ""Whoever did this might still be lurking in the walls. It's a maze back there, and dark.""

&gt;**She imagined Tyrion creeping between the walls like some monstrous rat**. No. You are being silly. The dwarf is in his cell. ""Take hammers to the walls. Knock this tower down, if you must. I want them found. Whoever did this. I want them killed.""

&gt; - Cersei I AFfC

&gt;____

But this still does not fulfill the valonqar prophecy.

##Arya as Ned's Gift of Mercy

###The Gift of Mercy

_____

&gt;Men of a hundred different nations labored in the mines, and each prayed to his own god in his own tongue, yet all were praying for the same thing. It was release they asked for, an end to pain. A small thing, and simple. Yet their gods made no answer, and their suffering went on. Are their gods all deaf? he wondered . . . until a realization came upon him, one night in the red darkness.

&gt;All gods have their instruments, men and women who serve them and help to work their will on earth. The slaves were not crying out to a hundred different gods, as it seemed, but to one god with a hundred different faces . . . and he was that god's instrument. That very night he chose the most wretched of the slaves, the one who had prayed most earnestly for release, and freed him from his bondage. The first gift had been given.""

&gt; - Arya II AFfC

&gt;___

&gt;And she had prayed. Oh, how she had prayed. Prayer was what they wanted, so she served it to them, served it on her knees as if she were some common trollop of the streets and not a daughter of the Rock. She had prayed for relief, for deliverance, **for Jaime**. 

&gt; - Cersei I ADwD

&gt;____

&gt;His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine. ""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;....The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man.**""

&gt; - Arya XII ASoS

&gt;____

The gift of mercy is when one drives a sword through another's heart.  Maester Lewin received it and it has been referenced a few more times.

_____

##Lightbringer

____

As weird and far-fetched as this seems so far, yes Lightbringer comes into play.  Ned Stark's Ice is going to become Lightbringer.  After Ned's beheading (as in, the very next chapter), the comet appears and its importance later emphasized in ACoK. George RR Martin could not have screamed that Ice is going to become Lightbringer any louder:

&gt;____

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword**,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. **When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after.**

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;_____

I will go further into depth about Lightringer, but only later:

&gt;____

&gt;Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke

Ned Stark's Ice is ""broken"" into two swords: Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper.  Brienne has Oathkeeper and Jaime has Widow's Wail.  If Jaime is executed or killed in battle, Arya using his face would mean she would also have Widow's Wail.

&gt;He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. **To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered**. 

Arya is going to give Cersei the gift of mercy.  The reason why the valonqar prophecy says that the valonqar will put his pale hands around her and choke the life from her is because she is going to become a *captured lion*. Syrio Forel taught Arya to capture cats (/u/dixonblues shoutout for the reminder):

&gt;____

&gt;Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cook’s huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day and night. 

&gt;The Red Keep was full of cats

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

&gt;____

Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon's army will slowly close in on her and Arya will be sent in to prevent further conflict or prevent Cersei from blowing up King's Landing.  And Arya giving Cersei the gift of mercy makes Jon Snow's lesson **MUCH** more significant:

&gt;____

&gt;""First lesson,"" Jon said. ""Stick them with the pointy end.""

&gt; - Jon II AGoT

&gt;____

&gt;Needle was Robb and Bran and Rickon, her mother and her father, even Sansa. Needle was Winterfell's grey walls, **and the laughter of its people**. Needle was the summer snows, Old Nan's stories, the heart tree with its red leaves and scary face, the warm earthy smell of the glass gardens, the sound of the north wind rattling the shutters of her room. Needle was Jon Snow's smile. He used to mess my hair and call me ""little sister,"" she remembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.

&gt;Polliver had stolen the sword from her when the Mountain's men took her captive, but when she and the Hound walked into the inn at the crossroads, there it was. The gods wanted me to have it. Not the Seven, nor Him of Many Faces, **but her father's gods, the old gods of the north**. The Many-Faced God can have the rest, she thought, but he can't have this.

&gt; - Arya II AFfC

&gt;_____


Plus, just to give you a tidbit from my Lightbringer tinfoil, a needle is used for sewing things together and fixing clothing.  Arya's sword is called ""Needle"". Similarly, reforging Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper is fixing a thing that was broken.  It's a wonder why the second paragraph of Arya's very first chapter in AGoT described her hands as that of a blacksmith:

&gt;____

&gt;#Arya

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**."" 

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

&gt;___

but I digress.  The real wonder is why Arya calls herself ""Mercy"" in TWoW. Maybe after Cersei loses all her children, goes mad, and is surrounded at King's Landing, Mercy is what she will need.  After all, it was the children which moved Ned to grant Cersei mercy.

&gt;____

&gt;""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""

&gt; - Cersei VIII AFfC

&gt;____

&gt;""For hands of gold are always cold, **but a woman's hands are warm**""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;____

The golden hands song refers to Tyrion visiting Shae at Chataya's.  The ""golden hands"" is the chain of golden linked hands the Hand of the King refers to.  I'd like to think this is one GRRM's cleverness. What if the ""golden hands"" also includes Jaime because he has a golden hand, and the end of the refrain saying ""but a woman's hands a warm"" to say that the valonqar is not the one of Cersei's two little brothers, but a woman?

##The Legend of Lightbringer

_____

&gt;___

&gt;Melisandre was robed all in scarlet satin and blood velvet, her eyes as red as the great ruby that glistened at her throat as if it too were afire. ""In ancient books of Asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him."" She lifted her voice, so it carried out over the gathered host. ""Azor Ahai, beloved of R'hllor! The Warrior of Light, the Son of Fire! Come forth, your sword awaits you! Come forth and take it into your hand!""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;____

It was Arya's chapter in which Ned Stark is beheaded.  At the beginning of the very next chapter:

&gt;___

&gt;“For a certainty,” Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, **measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky.**

&gt; - Bran VII AGoT

&gt;___

&gt;That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. ""**The Red Sword,"" the Bull named it; he claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn't a new sword, it was Ice, her father's greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard's blood on the blade after Ser Ilyn the King's Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after**.

&gt; - Arya I ACoK

&gt;____

&gt;""I have attended to it, good ser. Though His Grace frowns so whenever he does see me that I tremble to come before him. Do you think he would like me better if I wore a hair shirt and never smiled? Well, I will not do it. I am an honest man, he must suffer me in silk and samite. Or else I shall take my ships where I am better loved. That sword was not Lightbringer, my friend.""

&gt;The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. ""Sword?""

&gt;""A sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a burnt sword serve Stannis?""

&gt;""A burning sword,"" corrected Davos.

&gt;""Burnt,"" said Salladhor Saan, ""and be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero's blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.

&gt;""Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by plunging it through the beast's red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.

&gt;""A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. 'Nissa Nissa,' he said to her, for that was her name, 'bare your breast, and know that I love you best of all that is in this world.' She did this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of the forging of Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes.

&gt;""Now do you see my meaning? Be glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled from that fire. Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire burns."" Salladhor Saan finished the last grape and smacked his lips. ""When do you think the king will bid us sail, good ser?""

&gt; - Davos I ACoK

&gt;____

Salladhor San doubts Stannis' sword is lightbringer and goes on to tell the Legend of Lightbringer.  Meaning that this is *how* the sword Lightbringer shall be made.  There are three instances of an attempt to make Lightbringer: tempered in water, driven through the heart of a captured lion, and into Nissa Nissa's chest. 

____

##The Making of Lightbringer

____


What I have found is that the prophecy needs *two* read overs for it to fit nicely.  Possibly hinted at by the name of Azor Ahai's lover: ""Nissa, Nissa"".  The first read over points to the sword *which* shall become Lightbringer the second instance tells us *how* Lightbringer shall come about. The first read-through connects with King Joffrey's swords with rubies. First sword, Lion's Tooth, thrown into the Ruby Ford:

&gt;___

&gt;""Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.""

&gt;""Rubies,"" Sansa said, lost. ""What rubies?""

&gt;Arya gave her a look like she was so stupid. ""Rhaegar's rubies. This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown.""

&gt;...

&gt;“That was my lady’s sister you were hitting, do you know that?” A bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycah’s flesh, and a slow red line trickled down the boy’s cheek.

&gt;“Stop it!” Arya screamed. She grabbed up her fallen stick.

&gt;Sansa was afraid. “Arya, you stay out of this.”

&gt;“I won’t hurt him…much,” Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking his eyes off the butcher’s boy.

&gt;Arya went for him.

&gt;...

&gt;Then a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly Nymeria was there, leaping, jaws closing around Joffrey’s sword arm. The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet, and they rolled in the grass, the wolf snarling and ripping at him, the prince shrieking in pain. “Get it off,” he screamed. “Get it off!”
Arya’s voice cracked like a whip. “Nymeria!”

&gt;The direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Arya’s side. The prince lay in the grass, whimpering, cradling his mangled arm. His shirt was soaked in blood. Arya said, “She didn’t hurt you…much.” She picked up Lion’s Tooth where it had fallen, and stood over him, holding the sword with both hands.

&gt;Joffrey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. “No,” he said, “don’t hurt me. I’ll tell my mother.”

&gt;“You leave him alone!” Sansa screamed at her sister.

&gt;Arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into the throw. The blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. It hit the water and vanished with a splash”

&gt; - Sansa I AGoT

&gt;___

The second instance, Azor Ahai captured a lion and drove Lightbringer into its heart.  Before the Battle of Blackwater:

&gt;___

&gt;""My uncle's the one who will need mercy, but I won't give him any."" Joffrey drew his sword. The pommel was **a ruby cut in the shape of a heart**, set between a lion's jaws. Three fullers were deeply incised in the blade. ""My new blade, **Hearteater**.""

&gt;He'd owned a sword named Lion's Tooth once, Sansa remembered. Arya had taken it from him and thrown it in a river. I hope Stannis does the same with this one. 

&gt; - Sansa V ACoK

&gt;___

And Tyrion recounts the Battle of Blackwater:

&gt;___

&gt;""I knew Ser Mandon died in the battle."" **Shoved into the river by Pod, half a heartbeat before the treacherous bastard could drive his sword through my heart**. ""Who else was lost?""

&gt; - Tyrion I ASoS

&gt;___

The third instance, King Joffrey gets Widow's Wail, one of two swords derived from Ned Stark's Ice:

&gt;___

&gt;Sansa remembered Lion's Tooth, the sword Arya had flung into the Trident, and Hearteater, the one he'd made her kiss before the battle. She wondered if he'd want Margaery to kiss this one.

&gt;The guests were shouting out names for the new blade. Joff dismissed a dozen before he heard one he liked. ""Widow's Wail!"" he cried. ""Yes! It shall make many a widow, too!"" He slashed again.

&gt; - Sansa IV ASoS

&gt;___

Widow's Wail has rubies in the eyes of the golden lion heads for the cross guard.  The reason why Tywin chose rubies instead of any other gem:

&gt;As he entered his lord father's solar a few moments later, he heard a voice saying, "". . . cherrywood for the scabbards, bound in red leather and ornamented with a row of lion's-head studs in pure gold. Perhaps with garnets for the eyes . . .""

&gt;""Rubies,"" Lord Tywin said. ""**Garnets lack the fire**.""

&gt; - Tyrion IV ASoS

&gt;___

Rubies are gems that luster like fire.  Which is probably why Targaryen kings chose the gem for their crowns, and why followers of Rh'llor, like Melisandre, wear the gem.  The name of the series is *A Song of Ice and Fire* with *A Game of Thrones* being the first book, with Ned Stark's *Ice* on the front.  Perhaps, like /u/SchmedStark suggests, Lightbringer's actual name will be *Fire*.  That way the series name, *A Song of Ice and Fire* is very significant.  Not to mention the description  of the two derivative swordsin Jaime's dream:

&gt;___

&gt;“Stay with me,” Jaime pleaded. “Don’t leave me here alone.” But they were leaving.“Don’t leave me in the dark!” Something terrible lived down here. “Give me a sword, at least.”

&gt;“I gave you a sword,” Lord Tywin said.

&gt;It was at his feet. Jaime groped under the water until his hand closed upon the hilt. Nothing can hurt me so long as I have a sword. **As he raised the sword a finger of pale flame flickered at the point and crept up along the edge, stopping a hand’s breath from the hilt. The fire took on the color of the steel itself so it burned with a silvery-blue light, and the gloom pulled back**...

&gt;From behind came a great splash. Jaime whirled toward the sound... but the faint light revealed only Brienne of Tarth, her hands bound in heavy chains. “I swore to keep you safe,” the wench said stubbornly. “I swore an oath.” Naked, she raised her hands to Jaime. “Ser. Please. If you would be so good.”

&gt;The steel links parted like silk. “A sword,” Brienne begged, and there it was, scabbard, belt, and all. She buckled it around her thick waist. The light was so dim that Jaime could scarcely see her, though they stood a scant few feet apart. In this light she could almost be a beauty, he thought. **In this light she could almost be a knight. Brienne’s sword took flame as well, burning silvery blue.** The darkness retreated a little more.

&gt; - Jaime VI ASoS

&gt;____

Now, for the second read through of the Legend of Lightbringer, tells us how Lightbringer will be made.  First instance, tempered in water, is Ned Stark's Ice being broken into two.  The second instance, Arya will give Cersei the gift of mercy as Jaime with Widow's Wail, Oathkeeper (I'd say Widow's Wail because it is appropriate given Cersei is a widow), Needle, or even the catspaw dagger, if the show the fate of the dagger is to be believed by the show. The third instance, Nissa Nissa.  I will get to the third part later, but Gendry is going to reforge Ned Stark's Ice into Fire/Lightbringer.. Why? Tohbo Mott, Gendry's master, was the one who reworked Ned's Ice into Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper.

&gt;___

&gt;Q:Did Tohbo Mott ever teach Gendry the secrets of reworking Valyrian steel?

&gt;A:Interesting question.

&gt; - So Spake Martin, The Citadel

&gt;___

And plus Gendry was the one who described the comet as ""Red Sword"" when Arya thought it looked like Ice after Ned's beheading.

Catelyn also describes the Smith in the Faith of the Seven as one:

&gt;____

&gt;..**who fixed things that were broken**...

&gt; Catelyn IV ACoK

&gt;____

Ned Stark's Ice is something that is broken. Which is why, I believe, ""Needle"" is significant. Jon and Arya decided on the name because Arya did not like Needle work.  It was even said of Arya's hands:

&gt;_____

&gt;#Arya

&gt;Arya's stitches were crooked again.

&gt;She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. ""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,"" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. ""She has such fine, delicate hands."" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. ""**Arya has the hands of a blacksmith**.""

&gt; - Arya I AGoT

&gt;____

Needle is something that mends things together, much like Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail is something that needs to be brought together.

[MAIN SPOILERS] (TV Only) Could Cersei's three children...,"... be the rightful/legitimate/trueborn sons of Robert? This post talks only about the show.

So, when Ned ""reveals"" the ""truth"" in Season 1 he starts to name previous Baratheons describing them as black haired and blue eyed, which isn't as specific as ASOIAF's version where he describes all Baratheon-Lannister children, where the reader gets to see that all stag and lion children always have these traits. The purpose of this scene in GOT was to say that all Baratheons are black haired and blue eyed, and thus, Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella aren't Baratheons but Lannister bastards. But when we take a glance at Renly, and later, Stannis and Shireen this statement doesn't add up:

Stannis has the black hair but brown eyes, Shireen has blonde hair and blue eyes and Renly has hair and eyes both brown.

Since the Baratheon trait isn't that strong the possibilites of them looking like that are high enough.

Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen have blue eyes and not green like a Lannister would. If their father, mother, granmother and grandfather had green eyes and golden hair they would have the green eyes too, but they have it blue, like Robert had...

Some people would see Cersei's dialogue with Jaime and Eddard as evidence to them being incest bastards, but how can we take her word for truth? She drinks way more than Robert ever could have and she always tries to look away from the truth when it doesn't favor her, does she know they're Jaime's or does she just believe it to hide from the ""cruel"" truth?",gameofthrones,True,1514938418,2018-01-02
[Main Spoilers] Need help with a ASOIAF game,"So, I make board games in my spare time, just for fun to share with friends, usually pen-n-paper RPGs but am currently working on something that would be best be described as a Civilization type game where players start at static points and try to accomplish goals, usually war-type things. Most of the main scenarios are in the World Wars (A good example might be Fall Weiss or Brusilov Offensive, things for two-four players to play through in an evening or two).

My beta-testers are all huge ASOIAF/GOT fans, keeping up with the wikis and such, so I thought they might have more fun testing Westeros scenarios instead of World Wars. Only thing is, I really have no idea what I could make for them that would fit the bill. Something like Aegon's Conquest is probably too big for what I'm intending, but something like the Faith Militant Uprising seems a bit too small? Although if someone has any ideas for making both of those work, I'm all ears.

I only have one GoT scenario so far, but you could probably use it as an example of what I'm thinking of. With 2-5 players, it's Robb Stark's campaign against Tywin, Robb winning by capturing Casterly Rock but is fighting against a slowly dissolving army and Tywin wins by capturing Robb. So here we have one player as the Stark's side and the other as the Lannisters, but can be added to have one as the Tullys and the other as Joffery (If there's only two players, Tywin controls the Crownlands and Robb controls the Riverlands) with a player optionally playing as Renly or Stannis with extra rules if they want to do that.

Over the last couple seasons (not sure how much time has passed), he's grown as far as honor.

I don't have any grand theory, I'd just like thoughts about the reunion of Sansa and Tyrion and them possibly ending up together as Lord of Casterly Rock and Lady of Winterfell or simply moving on seperately.",gameofthrones,True,1514942816,2018-01-02

[S6]Does It Keep Getting Worse?,"So I really enjoyed the books, or at least the first, second and third. The fourth was okay, I suppose, and the fifth was better. For years, I intentionally ignored the TV show and avoided most of the spoilers, but a while back I decided to take the plunge and give it a shot, especially because it might now be the only way to ever get some kind of resolution to the story.

The TV show is, of course, very good. I'm now about halfway through season 6. I was excited but also apprehensive, since it's the first time the story will really be going beyond the books, and so far I'm actually rather unimpressed.

It's like the writers have taken leave of their senses. The explanation for the whitewalkers is both completely unimaginative and totally pointless. Everytime the Sand Snakes are on the screen, I feel like I'm watching an episode of *Hercules: The Legendary Journeys* with Kevin Sorbo. Don't get me wrong, I like that kind of pulp trash, but I didn't want it in my *Game of Thrones*. Each episode, it just becomes more like a Saturday morning kids cartoon. At this rate, I expect by the final season Daenarys, Jon, and Tyrion will all place their magic stones together to become Mecha-dragon to fight a giant whitewalker and show us all the power of teamwork.

One of the great things about the books is that they don't give into that temptation to wrap up every narrative thread with a pretty ribbon on top. Increasingly, however, the TV show isn't passing up any opportunity for some kind of melodramatic reckoning between characters, and every battle is beginning to feel like a videogame where the hero fights through all the disposable henchmen before a boss battle, replete with cheesy one liners and ironic deaths.

I mean, some of this is expected, but it's being layered on thick and fast now--way more than before.

I'm still enjoying it, and I'll continue to watch it, but is it all like this from here on? Should I be adjusting my expectations?",gameofthrones,True,1514950798,2018-01-02

[S1E2] Daenarys is the Moon,"I'm new to GOT (just finished the second season) but I already love analyzing it.

I THINK Dany and Doreah's discussion from S1E2 was a form of foreshadowing. In S1E2, Doreah tells Dany one of the legend of the dragons which is found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_h0egj9YY

In short: There were two moons in the sky, one wondered too close to sun and it hatched due to the heat and out of it pored thousands of dragons (essentially the moon was a dragon egg) and they drank the suns fire. The other reply by saying that the ""Moon is no egg, it is a goddess and wife of the sun.""

I think this is foreshadowing because in the show Dany calls Drogo her ""Sun and Stars"" and Drogo refers to Dany as ""Moon of my Life."" Dany is the moon that hatched the dragons due under Drogo's heat (she hatched him with the fire used at his funeral.)

As for dorne I think she will either leave dorne in anarchy or she will install a noble/puppet dictator from the crown lands as well or she will have a house not loyal to house Martell installed.

[EVERYTHING] Theory/Prediction on Arya,"So I saw a video on youtube several hours ago that in thought was interesting, I'll leave a link for it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcOf3uVbTJg&amp;t=1s

The theory goes is that Arya will kill Tyrion before she heads more west (or Rejoins the FM). Now the reasoning for this is that she has not seen Tyrion's good deeds she only saw what was represented at the stage play in Braavos. So she will not be please with Tyrion at WF (well she will have problems with some of the people there ins general), So she will kill Tyrion and every last piece of the Arya we knew in S3 will be officially gone and it will be Bitter that way but sweet because she will be sailing more west.

I don't think this will happen in that way mainly because I think Tyrion will live to the end first of all (but his tongue I think will be cut out), and also I think Sansa would clear up that the play was BS. However if Arya is still skeptical (for some reason) and something like this still happens then maybe I can see her trying too perhaps during a meeting on the strategy to defeat the WW's but the wine glass that was suppose to go to Tyrion instead goes to Sansa, Sansa then ends up accidentally getting poisoned and she dies. Arya realizing she let her vengeance get the better of her this time and she will either go into self-imposed exile or Varys and Tyrion will find out via Varys skills as a ""Spider"" and Tyrion will demand Jon banish her (Remember Tyrion actually cares about Sansa) and Jon will reluctantly banish her with Arya not being able to live in WF after what she did.

But she will sail more west or marry Gendry and be lady of Stormlands which would be the Sweet part of the Bittersweet ending. Now I don't think it will go down like that either sense I still don't think Arya would try too kill Tyrion but maybe like it could happen like maybe Jaqen actually does too frame Arya so she can get her to rejoin the FM or something.",gameofthrones,True,1515029147,2018-01-03

[MAIN SPOILERS] How I Think Game of Thrones Ends,"First-time poster here so please go easy on the criticism!

I believe the TV show will end with Daenerys voluntarily sacrificing herself to become the Night Queen.  She is the princess who was promised, to the Night King, in the original pact between the First Men and the Others.  By becoming the Night Queen, Dany will fulfill her destiny of being the savior of Westeros, honoring the pact and bringing an end to the White Walker invasion.  

In addition, I also think that Jon will have to ""create"" Dany as the NQ her by inserting the catspaw dagger, currently held by Arya, into her heart.  It is this dagger specifically that can be used to create the Night Queen, because it is made from the same piece of dragonglass that the COFT used to create the original Night King, as seen in ""The Door"" episode via Bran's vision.  This is why this dagger is so special and was featured prominently in an ancient text read by Sam and Gilly at the Citadel (in the Season 7 premiere, ""Dragonstone"").  Jon's creation of Dany as NQ will mirror the AA legends regarding Nissa Nissa.  It is a very tidy ending. 

I have seen theories online that get at parts of this potential ending, but I think they are missing some key evidence.  For example, we see the White Walkers begin their march southward at the end of season 2, paralleling the end of season 1 which is when Dany becomes the mother of dragons. Dany unlocks her magic with the birth of the dragons, and her arrival signals to the NK that his bride has finally arrived. More importantly, though, are the events in S7E4, The Spoils of War.  I think this title is a hint, and refers not only at the wars directly shown and alluded to in the episode, but also to the great war between the First Men and the Others.  The spoils of that great war included the pact requiring the delivery of a human queen to the Others (the princess who was promised).  Not just any queen, but a magic queen - the first and only human who would someday give life to dragons.  

In The Spoils of War, the evidence for this theory was strengthened to a point where I now consider it more likely than not.  The cave drawings under Dragonstone are shown, depicting the truce between the First Men, COFT, and the Others.  Why is this at dragonstone?  Because this is the place where the pact was made, and where the princess who was promised would eventually be born.  

At the 23:28 mark of The Spoils of War, we are quickly shown a distinct image of a pair of thrones carves into the wall.  One is occupied, and one is empty.  Above the thrones is the sigil of the Others.  I believe the empty throne is waiting for Dany.  I have submitted this link separately as ""Dany NQ Cave Drawing"". 

So in short, 

- Dany is the princess who was promised, to the Night King

- The pact is clearly documented beneath Dragonstone, which is Dany's birthplace

- To fulfill the pact and end the war, Dany will have to become the NQ

- Dany will sacrifice herself to be the savior of Westeros, and Jon will be the one create her 

I have other ideas for the ending beyond those, such as what happens to Westeros going forward (namely, democracy and president Tyrion) and what the implications are for Jon's role in the story, but am far less confident in those ideas.  I am really confident in D=NQ.         ",gameofthrones,True,1515098224,2018-01-04

[EVERYTHING] Best resources/Maps for season 3 and foward,"I was wondering if maybe I could get a little help from reddit. You see, my dad is watching Game of Thrones and so far he has almost ended the 2nd season, however, things are starting to get complicated for him, such as where exactly in the world characters are or what certain things means, such as events from the past or which characters belong to certain houses.

For instance, he was certainly surprised when I explained to him the House Mormont situation, that Jeor and Jorah are actually parent and son and that they are in differents parts of the world because Jorah's slave trader background got him exiled after Jeor abdicated his titles to him and joined the Night's Watch. He did, however, connected the dots when I told him this, because he did know that Jeor had a son that got exiled, as he remembers Jeor metioning this to Jon the moment he gave him Longclaw. Then I showed him a Westeros Map, which surprised him even more when I told him where Jorah (and Daenerys) was and where Jeor is at the moment.

However, the maps I found are pretty low quality and you cant really read the legends on it, so I was wondering if any of you got quality maps, maybe one with both big and small houses on it? Or any other resource that makes it easier to understand the series, such as a family tree (I actually believe this is better) Thanks!

[Everything] Born amidst salt and smoke...,"I was reading SOS yesterday and came to Davos chapter. In this POV chapter Melisandre said she knew Stannis was the Prince Who was Promised because she saw it would be the Prince of Dragonstone and other reasons.

It got me thinking about the whole prophecy. I think the most logical person for this to be I think is Jon Snow but I was never able to see how he fit in with the ""salt and smoke"" line of the story.

However, I think it could simply mean that his life resulted in the massive war that was Robert's Rebellion. After Rhaegar and Lyanna eloped war erupted throughout Westeros. In war, people use fire to destroy crops, homes, and entire towns. Salt can also be used to damage lands.

What if ""born amidst salt and smoke"" simply refers to the fact that his parents actions simultaneously led to his birth and a huge war that tore through the countryside?",gameofthrones,True,1515110590,2018-01-04
[EVERYTHING] How to properly watch Game of Thrones,"Sooooo about a year and a half ago I took an interest into watching A Game of Thrones because I kept hearing about it. It was Tuesday before one of the new season 6 episodes and my brother jokingly said I should just catch up with the show before Sunday. So I did. I proceeded to watch 54 episodes in 5 days. I was impressed with my ability to binge a show that much, but I didn't think that was as fast as I could've. Since then, I've proceeded to binge the show 3 times. I literally can't watch the show again 1 episode at a time, only all at once. Here are my thoughts on how to get the full experience out of the show:

1) Watch at least 18 episodes a day (Depends how many interruptions you get per day). Things need to be moving. 18 episodes in the realm will be more eventful than whatever else you planned to do that day.

2) This is related to #1. sleep about 6 hours a night. Watching absurd amounts of TV makes you more tired than you think. Especially if you do it for several days. If you watch at least 18 episodes per day and get only 6 hours of sleep per night, you will catch up in less than 4 days (Only 4 days!!!). 

3) Eat cheese and drink wine. Stopping to cook food is a liability. You'll do pretty well for yourself just eating cheese so don't worry about your bladder. Of course you wine too for nostalgia purposes.

4) Invite friends to come over and watch the occasional episode. It's more fun with friends, but I'm sure not all your friends are as hardcore as you. They might also bring snacks besides cheese so you can balance your diet.

5) Cry. A lot. I binge the show twice a year to get all of my TV watching desires out of me before a new semester at college. I associate a lot of good feels with this show and usually end up crying.

6) Post on the Game of Thrones subreddit about how you watched all the seasons (1-7) in under 4 days time because you are strangely proud of this achievement. ",gameofthrones,True,1515111035,2018-01-04
[EVERYTHING] Who would win: Knights of the Vale or The Dothraki (calvary vs. calvary),"Just finished re-watching the series (tv and book) and I was wondering; who would win in an open-field battle? Jorah mentions that when he first saw the Dothraki he'd say that well armoured knights would beat them quite easily, but after spending some time with them he isn't so sure. 

We've seen them fight against the Lannisters in S7E4, but those weren't knights - just normal soldiers, not battled hardened veterans (and of course the scare-effect is huge when facing them).
 
I'm still thinking Dothraki since they'd probably go for the horse rather than the heavy-armoured knight, but I have an open mind.

[EVERYTHING] So about Tywin's thoughts on Tyrion..,"Why was he so opposed to naming Tyrion the heir? Because that would mean Cersei would be his heir. The same Cersei he later wanted to marry off to Loras. Now, if that wasn't a matrilineal marriage, then not making Tyrion his heir would make the new Lord of the Westerlands a Tyrell. And surely he *noticed* Tyrion's talent for politics? He has to know Tyrion is good at it, because he named him Hand of the King for a reason. Once Tyrion asked to be made heir, Tywin also said he'd find a 'suitable position for his talents'. So he also recognizes he *has* talents.

To sum it up: Tywin claims to care about the family name, but would rather have the family lose Casterly Rock through marriage than to appoint his clearly more competent son who might bring a couple of hookers.",gameofthrones,True,1515119982,2018-01-04

 Then there is the Stark slaughter which is just brutal and terrifying, the baby eddard thing is the cherry on top of all the misery.. truly one of the most difficult episodes of tv for me to watch if not #1... I cant think of anything else that I dread as much, seldom does TV produce a story that gets to a point where it has such a powerful episode. Shoutout GRRM for the plantin the seeds of this greatness I really have come to love majority of the people its so sad watchin them go.

Will the book still have great sales no matter when it's released? I think it will. But especially after the show ends, a lot of hype will decay and die off and he'll definitely lose some sales.

[EVERYTHING] Olly is a servant for the lord of light?,"Ok this just a theory that Olly may be the lord of light or at least a servant for him. Everywhere the lord of light worshippers goes there is always chaos. Just look at King Stannis, who worshipped the god for many years and what did he gain in return? Absolute destruction of his army and family. Stannis first lost a brother and his army to the lord of light for misleading him. Then it started an all out war in Westeros, Stannis lost a lot of men in Kings Landing to fire and what is lord of light? Right a fire god. Later on Stannis, kept losing, lost half his army for sacrificing his daughter and was then ultimately defeated in Winterfell to Ramsey Bolton. Only for him to be killed by the witness of Renly murder.
Now where do this leave Olly? There is a lot of similarities to where Olly went. He first got his own village killed, because he is the lord of light. Then he went to the Night's watch and soon after they took him in. He started causing chaos by misleading people into thinking Jon Snow was a bad person. Later on he started a war with the freefolk and killed Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow's life. He soon took Jon Snow life by betraing him with other members of the Night's watch, to take control, again chaos has happened because of Olly. This path lead down into more chaos where Jon Snow was revived, thanks to the lord of light and was forced to hang the traitors. Now Jon Snow took a chaotic path too by leading a army against Ramsey Bolton the true warden of Winterfell. Jon Snow was now the main reason thousands of soldiers was killed in the Battle of the bastards and soon Jon Snow started 2 all out wars in Westeros. One by claiming him to be the King in the North which leads to huge battles where many soldiers were killed in battle against the rightful air to the Iron Throne Cersie Lannister. The second all out war is against the Night King which is only here to bring people back together in a peaceful way, but Jon Snow is too desperat to sabotage the Night King plan and Jon Snow only did this because he wanted more power and become the King of westeros.

When Jon Snow died and was resurrected by the lord of light, it was then Jon Snow became a servant of the lord of light. Just look at all the destruction he has caused and misleading people. Just like what the lord of light servant did to Stannis and what Olly did too Jon Snow. 
My conclusion is Olly must the reincarnation of the lord of light, because he never studied the practicing of becoming a lord of the light priest. So the only way for Olly to cause this much destruction was to either have died, which he did not or being the reincarnation of the chaos god. Only after his purpose was completed he died.

So are there anything else that could prove this theory correct?",gameofthrones,True,1515175802,2018-01-05

[SPOILERS S1E8] Question about the how the wight-turning process works.,,gameofthrones,True,1515193608,2018-01-05
[MAIN SPOILERS] A question about the wight-turning process.,"In S1E8, when the Night's Watch recovered the bodies of the men who went missing with Benjen Stark, Sam comments that they don't smell of rot. I took this to mean one of two things. Either a) the bodies froze quickly and were preserved by the cold, or b) they had already been turned into wights by a White Walker, which magically stops their decomposition. 

If A is true, how did they later become wights and attack Jon? If B is true, were the wights playing dead? Is that something they can do? 

Jafer Flowers has dark eyes, not blue ones, so I'm inclined to think option A occurred and they were somehow raised later, but that doesn't make sense as it would mean there was a WW south of the wall. We never see a delayed raising of the dead in the rest of the series, or a WW raising someone from far away, so I wasn't sure what exactly happened in this episode, and some clarification would be appreciated.

[EVERYTHING] How possible is it that Tywin purposefully orchestrated the Defiance of Duskendale to either displace Aerys or drive him further into madness?,"According to the books, Tywin discouraged Aerys from going to Duskendale, which you would think dismisses him from blame.  
However, also according to the books, up until this point, Aerys and Tywin's relationship had gone really sour and Aerys was deliberately doing the opposite of everything Tywin counseled to him as Hand of the King. I find it hard to believe that one of the Realm's most successful and tactical military leaders had absolutely *no* idea Aerys would disobey his advice and go to Duskendale.  
If anything, isn't it possible Tywin told him ""explicitly"" not to go, precisely so that he would?  
Of course, Tywin cannot predict what would happen and that Aerys would be captured, but he was firm in not negotiating with Lord Denys. In fact, the books explicitly state that Aerys' paranoia was a result of Tywin not negotiating to save him. It can even be argued that Tywin felt that Aerys would in fact be killed by Denys and was not negotiating with them specifically to encourage it from happening.  
The next question is, why? Well, at the tournament to honor Viserys' birth, Tywin asked Aerys to marry Cersei to Rhaegar and unify their houses. Aerys rejected, calling Tywin a servant to the king, and again, the books state that it was an insult that Tywin would never forgive. This literally was the last thing to happen before the conflict with Duskendale started.  
Once he realized that Aerys as king would cause irreparable damage to his house (something he literally all but killed his own father to restore), he knew he needed to displace Aerys as soon as possible.  
It's widely accepted that Rhaegar attended the Tournament in order to speak to other Lords about replacing his father. I think that by this point, Tywin wanted plausible deniability, so when Aerys finally insulted him a last time by naming Jaime to his Kingsguard, he resigned from his post. By then everything had been set in motion and Aerys was spiraling out of control.  
And what was the result of this madness? Tywin's daughter marrying Robert Baratheon and becoming Queen.  
Oh and, a lot of people say that Aerys was mad even before the Defiance, because Barristan Selmy specifically says so, however it's important that we consider that the Defiance of Duskendale made him much much worse. He was crazy before, but most believed Tywin and Rhaegar could keep him together at least until Rhaegar came into power. But I think Tywin stopped believing this when Aerys started making plans for Tywin's children which would affect the future of his house. What difference does it make if Rhaegar takes over after Jaime is sworn to the kingsguard and Rhaegar is married to someone else?  ",gameofthrones,True,1515231492,2018-01-06

[Main Spoilers] Did Littlefinger believe Jon Snow?,"Ok, first of all, I find it a bit hard that all those Lords gathered in Winterfell believed Jon Snow's story about White Walkers so easily. But maybe they had faith in their King in the North, so ok. What about Lord Royce? Being from the Vale, and judging by his behaviour, I believe he would believe in and follow a trueborn Stark instead. And the North would believe these stories better.

Anyway, what about Littlefinger? This is a man who only concerns himself with manipulating the living, and turning them against one another, so that he could accumulate human power, and all that. How did he believe Jon Snow so easily? Shouldn't he be secretly thinking that Jon Snow is trying to manipulate the Lords into following him out of a fear of an unknown enemy that doesn't really exist? 

With Daenerys and her dragons, we see that he at least truly believes that, and was concerned with Tyrion being her Hand, and was considering how to tackle her. If he honestly did believe in White Walkers, how was it that he was still concerned with human politics? Shouldn't he AT LEAST, think of a way to ensure just HIS own survival? We of course wouldn't expect him to look out for others.

Maybe he knows they exist, but doesn't think that they're a big threat? ",gameofthrones,True,1515233800,2018-01-06

[Everything] Why Craster could be Rhaegar Targaryen?,"This is just a theory but Craster could be Rhaegar Targaryen, because Jeor Mormont shared an alliance with him to give him information about the wildlings. What did Rhaegar Targaryen gain in return? Safety beyond the wall where he could start a new family, after gaining knowledge about what happened to his family. Of course he was furious and wanted revenge? What was the best way to get that revenge? Support the White walkers with sons. Jeor Mormont suggested that Rhaegar Targaryen should change his name, because even among the Night's watch his safety was not guarenteed. When they visited his cabin for info. Jeor Mormont and Craster shares a mutual friendship. So How could Rhaegar Targaryen have escaped from the rebellion? He found one who looked like him and paid him a fortune to be him. So the fake one died at the battle of the Trident, while the real one fleeing north, the fake one thought he would be rich and a king now but his poor battle strategy lead him through his downfall, now Rhaegar Targaryen safety was almost secured. Craster is a bitter cruel angry old man, no wonder after what happened to his family. He only have respect for Jeor Mormont and dont trust anyone except Jeor Mormont. Rhaegar Targaryen may have had visions about the white walkers and the the 3 headed dragon who will save the world with fire. He already had a son and daughter but was about to get another one so the prophecy could come true, since what happen he no longer believes in the prophecy about the 3 headed dragon. What do Craster have now? Lots of children, the family Rhaegar Targaryen wanted for so long. What do the Targaryens and Craster have in common? They have several inbreeding children and dont think it's wrong. Who is at the Castle black? Aemon Targaryen which died some episodes ago. What do Craster thinks about himself? He thinks he's a god while Daenerys followers think she is a god. So this prove that at least some Targaryen have escaped, so maybe Rhaegar travel with him to Castle Black and made the deal with the Night's Watch to protect him from the several lords and kings who wanted him dead. So know that the Night King is gonna ride a dragon, this lead me further to believe that the Night King and Rhaegar Targaryen have the same blood line, because Craster gave all his sons to the Night King and the Night King most have Dragon blood in his veins. What did Karl Tanner do to Craster? He killed him and John Snow got revenge on him later on. That must have been a hint that Craster is Rhaegar Targaryen. I think i have made several proof that Rhaegar Targaryen could indeed be Craster, but who cares now his dead. What does this mean for the future?

[MAIN SPOILERS] Opinions of Lyanna Stark?,"I have very conflicting views of Lyanna.
On the one hand, I admire her for what a strong-willed ‘she-wolf’ she is, who ultimately followed her heart and put herself first, when eloping with Rhaegar, especially in a world that is difficult enough for women as it is. 
   Though, I can’t help but feeling that surely, as an honourable Stark woman, she should of known of the consequences of her actions? A betrothal, after all, is a very serious thing. Their secret ultimately started a war, and killed Rhaegar, as well as her own father and brother and Rhaegar’s family, including Rhaegar’s innocent children and Elia. If she had survived the birth, surely she would’ve never been able to live with herself.
Then again, if they had restrained how they were feeling and she had married Robert and Rhaegar stayed with Elia, neither one of them probably would’ve been happy. (And no Jon!)

[MAIN SPOILERS] Is Jon Snow Overrated as Hero?,"While I do think he's a very well written character, particularly in the show (book Jon Snow is difficult to care about in my opinion), is he truly a 'hero'? If anything, he is usually the one being saved or bailed out of a situation. It has required a heavy reliance on others to get him to where he is now in the show. Let's look at his resume.

1. Karl Tanner beat him. He was saved by one of Crastor's wives last minute. 
2. The countless times Ygritte saved him from being fucked up by the wildlings while he was undercover.
3. That time he died and the red woman bailed him out of death. 
4. BotB one - when Ramsay's cavalry almost wrecked him and his cavalry came in last minute.
5. BotB two - when Sansa and the Knights of the Vale rode in to win the battle. 
6. When north of the wall Dany flies in on her dragons last minute.
7. When he falls through the ice and Benjen Stark saves him. 

From the top of my head, his best credits are Hardhome and saving Mormont from the wight earlier in the show in terms of saving others. You could argue he saved Mance from a worse death than was coming to him I guess. 
I just can't help but think the only really awesome thing he did was kill the white walker at Hardhome. Even his 1v1 with Ramsay was tainted with his entire army watching on, ready to fill Ramsay full of arrows. Just seems to me like his best traits as a character are without heroism. He seems more like the guy we admire for his honor and bringing the best out of others (Sam, Pip, Grenn, Tormund, etc).

"[EVERYTHING] Brad Pitt Bid $120,000 to Watch ‘Game of Thrones’ With Emilia Clarke","Pitt offered to pay $120,000 to watch an episode of “Game of Thrones” with Emilia Clarke — but he was outbid.

Pitt bid six figures to watch a “Game of Thrones” episode with Clarke on Saturday night during a silent auction at Sean Penn’s annual gala for Haiti, held at Milk Studios in Los Angeles, California.

During the charity gala, the auctioneer announced the opportunity to watch an episode with Clarke, who was in attendance at the A-list event, along with her “Game of Thrones” co-star Kit Harington, though the cast members were seated at separate tables.

The auction to watch the episode with Clarke started at $20,000, but the race quickly escalated. At one point, the auctioneer yelled out “Is the King of the North here?!” But as it turned out, Harington had stepped out of the gala to go to the restroom.

Meanwhile, Pitt bid $80,000 to watch an episode of “GOT” with Clarke. Then he outbid himself to $90,000. When Harington came back into the room, the actor offered to also sit in on the episode viewing. And that’s when Pitt raised his own bid to $120,000.

In the end, Pitt was outbid by a gala-goer who ended the auction at $160,000.

[EVERYTHING] The Correct Theory of Lightbringer,"[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/7ojsts/main_spoilers_what_is_your_favorite_game_of/) has discussed many theories of lightbringer.  But they are all wrong.  Ned Stark's Ice is going to become Lightbringer.  Ice is going to become Fire.  Which is why you see Ice on the front cover of the first book of *A Song of* **Ice** *and Fire*.  Ice is going to become reforged into Lightbringer, making *A Song of Ice and Fire* title much more significant.

____

#GRRM's inspiration

___

&gt;I revere Lord of the Rings, I reread it every few years, it had an enormous effect on me as a kid. In some sense, when I started this saga I was replying to Tolkien, but even more to his modern imitators.

GRRM's biggest inspiration/influence of ASoIaF/GoT is no doubt is Lord of the Rings.  GRRM even stated that he was aiming for a similar bittersweet ending like LotR.  Ned Stark's Ice becoming reforged into Fire reflects Narsil being reforged into Andúril:

&gt;""Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Andúril, Flame of the West.""

______

#The Legend of Lightbringer

_____

The Legend of Lightbringer requires two read-overs, likely implied by the lover's name ""Nissa Nissa"", in order to understand it.  The first read-through points to which sword is lightbringer (the rubies, gems that have fire to them, point the way), the second read through tells us *how* Lightbringer is going to be made.

First time Lightbringer is tempered in water, and Joffrey's first sword was thrown into the Ruby Ford by Arya.

Second time it was tempered in a lion's heart, Joffrey's second sword is hearteater and it had a heart-shaped ruby inside the lion's jaws. He commanded Ser Mandon Moore to kill Tyrion.

&gt;""I knew Ser Mandon died in the battle."" Shoved into the river by Pod, half a heartbeat before the treacherous bastard could drive his sword through my heart. ""Who else was lost?""

&gt; - Tyrion I ASoS

Joffrey's third sword is Widow's Wail, which parallels with the lover Nissa Nissa crying out in ecstasy and it cracking the moon.  It had rubies in the eyes of the lion. First Nissa in Nissa Nissa is Catelyn Stark.

This is the first read over and it tells us which sword is Lightbringer, the second readover tells us *how* it will become Lightbringer.

First time it was tempered in water and broke - Ned Stark's Ice was broken into two.

Second time it was tempered it was in a captured lion's heart, Arya is going to give Cersei the gift of mercy as Jaime (since Jaime has Widow's Wail).  The gift of mercy was taught to Arya by the hound.

&gt;One day, in an earthen hollow made by the roots of a fallen oak, they came face to face with another survivor of the Twins. The badge on his breast showed a pink maiden dancing in a swirl of silk, and he told them he was Ser Marq Piper's man; a bowman, though he'd lost his bow. His left shoulder was all twisted and swollen where it met his arm; a blow from a mace, he said, it had broken his shoulder and smashed his chainmail deep into his flesh. ""A northman, it was,"" he wept. ""His badge was a bloody man, and he saw mine and made a jape, red man and pink maiden, maybe they should get together. I drank to his Lord Bolton, he drank to Ser Marq, and we drank together to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin and the King in the North. And then he killed me."" His eyes were fever bright when he said that, and Arya could tell that it was true. His shoulder was swollen grotesquely, and pus and blood had stained his whole left side. There was a stink to him too. He smells like a corpse. The man begged them for a drink of wine.

&gt;""If I'd had any wine, I'd have drunk it myself,"" the Hound told him. ""I can give you water, and the gift of mercy.""

&gt;The archer looked at him a long while before he said, ""You're Joffrey's dog.""

&gt;""My own dog now. Do you want the water?""

&gt;""Aye."" The man swallowed. ""And the mercy. Please.""

&gt;They had passed a small pond a short ways back. Sandor gave Arya his helm and told her to fill it, so she trudged back to the water's edge. Mud squished over the toe of her boots. She used the dog's head as a pail. Water ran out through the eyeholes, but the bottom of the helm still held a lot.

&gt;When she came back, the archer turned his face up and she poured the water into his mouth. He gulped it down as fast as she could pour, and what he couldn't gulp ran down his cheeks into the brown blood that crusted his whiskers, until pale pink tears dangled from his beard. When the water was gone he clutched the helm and licked the steel. ""Good,"" he said. ""I wish it was wine, though. I wanted wine.""

&gt;""Me too."" The Hound eased his dagger into the man's chest almost tenderly, the weight of his body driving the point through his surcoat, ringmail, and the quilting beneath. As he slid the blade back out and wiped it on the dead man, he looked at Arya. ""**That's where the heart is, girl. That's how you kill a man**.""

The captured lion is going to be Cersei and Arya was taught by Syrio Forel to capture cats:

&gt;Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cook's huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day and night. When she'd run to him with her hands bleeding, he had said, ""So slow? Be quicker, girl. Your enemies will give you more than scratches."" He had dabbed her wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip to keep from screaming. Then he sent her out after more cats.

&gt;**The Red Keep was full of cats.**

&gt; - Arya III AGoT

If, indeed, Arya gives Cersei the gift of mercy, it makes Jon Snow's first lesson: ""Stick them with the pointy end"" much more significant.  [Stick them with the pointy end is even one of two of GRRM's favorite lines in the books](https://today.tamu.edu/2013/03/22/author-george-r-r-martin-is-visiting-texas-am-talks-game-of-thrones-and-texas-am-libraries/).

[If you are interested, click here to read my ""Arya is Ned's Gift of Mercy to Cersei"" theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/7jpr67/spoilers_main_arya_is_neds_gift_of_mercy/)

The third time where he tempered it is where I'm unsure about.  But one thing I am sure about is that the third time is when it actually becomes lightbringer.  I believe, personally, the third time he tempered it is just saying Daenerys is going to die around the time it is made.  Why?

&gt;""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,"" said Mirri Maz Duur. ""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""

&gt;**Glowing like sunset**, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow.

Oldtown is where Ice will likely become reforged into Lightbringer.  The sun rising in the West is it becoming forged in Oldtown (which is the location of the astrolabe that is used as the sun in the intro of game of thrones) and the sun setting in the east is when the Others are defeated.

I also believe that Ice will become named ""Fire"" when it becomes Lightbringer.  Making the title ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" much more significant.  I mean, Ned Stark's Ice is even on the cover of the first *A Song of Ice and Fire* book.  So I definitely think it's heading in that direction.

[MAIN SPOILERS] Give me some sick Tywin quotes.,"My favourite quote is ""Any man who says 'I am King' is no true king"". I love it because pretty much most characters in a high position such as Cersei, Dany, Joffrey, Stannis, Tommen,etc. All proclaimed they are King/Queen, yet Jon's always saying he's a bastard and not taking his ""King in the North"" with pride. He takes it as honour which I love. 

Now, I haven't watched the show in a while. And I want to know if there are any more sick quotes that you think is meant for this character but, refers to another. For example: When Robert Baratheon said he has a son, and Ned has a daughter, they would join houses. You'd think it meant Sansa and Joffrey, but imo right now it refers to Arya and Gendry.

[MAIN SPOILERS] The Hodor Paradox,"Usual spoiler warning stipulations. 

TL;DR - If present-day Bran’s affected Hodor’s past, fans he change almost anything? Is what we are watching just Bran’s altered world?

By now, I can’t be the first person to consider the following, so if there’s a good thread kindly direct me to it. 

If Bran can influence the past, he can undo a lot of story thus far, provided the change doesn’t preclude his becoming the Three-Eyed Raven.

But (everything before it is bull$#!+ amiright Ned?)  IMHO most of the story wouldn’t change Bran’s path. So couldn’t he compose a version of events that nullifies quite a lot of the show’s story?

I’m guessing most of us don’t need a deep lecture to appreciate a time paradox. If no such paradox exists, wouldn’t it stand to reason Bran has been orchestrating quite a bit of the entire show?

How have folks reconciled / tried to rationalize this?

(Hope I did this right I’m unfamiliar with posting on Reddit lmao)


I’ve been binge watching the entire show for the first time and the show has been awesome so far. I think everything was great (except maybe the 2nd half of Shae’s storyline but I’m starting to understand the reasoning behind it now)

Throughout season 4 and the beginning of season 5, it looked like Sansa was finally becoming a player of the game and she was learning from Littlefinger. I know Ramsay Bolton is already a bad sign for Sansa, but I was under the impression she was going to take Winterfell from him eventually with her newfound confidence.

But then she goes right back to being a victim like she’s always been for the entirety of the show. Why? Is there a payoff to this?

Another thing that irks me is that when making Theon watch, I feel like they’re making this story about him. So was all that development of Sansa unimportant? Or am I missing something?

I’m not outraged at the fact she was assaulted, I’m mad because now she appears to be scared and timid again when she was finally becoming confident and stronger",gameofthrones,True,1514053651,2017-12-23

Here is the scene: https://youtu.be/ozPholpWbCw?t=184 When I google this specific scene, people just say it is Jojen seeing his own fiery death, Craster's Keep burning down, other things similar, etc. But, I feel like it means a lot more. Like, something with a hand on fire will be ""The End"", meaning the End of the war with the White Walkers.

A hand on fire could mean two things in my opinion: Something with Jaime and the wildfire. There's a strange and important connection between Jaime and Bran and the wildfire and the White Walkers.

The other one is potentially a ""hand"" burning, and by ""hand"" this could be Tyrion burning towards the end. But this is much more tinfoil. I definitely think it relates to Jaime more.

[EVERYTHING] What will come of Petyr Baelish?,"Sorry for my formatting. My phone is not cooperating. Now....I'm not a fan of bringing characters back for the sake of shock value; however, if it benefits the narrative, I'm all for it. Having said that, I'm not necessarily in favor of resurrecting him...it's just that...I feel his story hasn't truly come to a close. Now I know that he will be mentioned in Season 8 due to the fact that he was so instrumental in the chaos that is the ""game of thrones"", but it goes beyond that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm convinced that we will see Littlefinger walking upright once more (and not in the form of Arya wearing his face). One option: he is reanimated as a wight once The Night King lays siege to Winterfell. Option 2: Melisandre needs him alive in order to help R'hllor see things through. Option 3 (which stands at a 0% chance of occurring ): They borrow elements from one of the characters in the books and apply it to a different character on the show. That character? Lady Stoneheart. I'm not saying that he'd end up leading The Brothers Without Banners or anything. I'd just love to see Littlefinger 2.0. He'd be unstoppable and a small part of me could truly see it working if done correctly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now I know that they don't have enough time to introduce a Petyr Stoneheart storyline, but it's Christmas goddammit and a boy can dream.

[Everything] An observation about the Citadel,"I'm not sure if this is just plain obvious, but it occurred to me that the reason Sam found out about Jon's legitimacy is that the Citadel wanted him to. 

1. They probably know Sam and Jon are close friends.

2. There was probably a maester  at the ToJ, since Ned called for one and it would make sense for Rhaegar to have arranged one to be there to deliver his child, which means they know Jon's true parentage and claim.

So they put those pieces together and they give Sam the high septons diary which chronicles the event, whilst frustrating him into leaving the citadel with a bumbling old bunch of beaurocrats act. They also give him access to the area of the library with WW information because he would be unlikely to leave without something to help Jon.

The motivation is what has already been revealed about their quest to rid the world of magics and the reference to them eliminating the dragons that once were. The warlocks of Qarth said Dany's dragons brought magic back into the world, so it would make sense that the citadel would want to do what they did before and eliminate the dragons. It would be reasonable of them to assume that if Jon knows about his claim it might cause a conflict between himself and Dany that will at least weaken her position.",gameofthrones,True,1514321239,2017-12-26
[EVERYTHING] Targaryen line of succession...,"I think a case can be made that Jon Snow is not, in fact, the rightful heir to the Targaryen throne. It has been recently accepted that since Jon Snow is a legitimate son to Rhaegar, that it is Jon who is the rightful heir to the Targaryen throne, and not Dany. I don't think so. This is why....

1. Aerys II (aka the Mad King) was on the throne with an heir in place.

2. Aerys' heir was Rhaegar.

3. Had Rhaegar outlived Aerys, Rhaegar would have been the king and his heirs (Jon Snow) would have been in line for the crown. 

4. *BUT*... Rhaegar died at the Battle of the Trident, slain by Robert Baratheon.

5. Because Aerys was killed by Jaime Lannister *AFTER* Rhaegar's death in battle, the line of succession would have gone to Aerys' oldest living child, which at the time would have been Viserys.

6. When Viserys got his golden crown, this would have passed down to Daenerys.

I think a reasonable argument can be made toward Dany being the rightful Targaryen heir to the Iron Throne.

[MAIN SPOILERS] How would you rate the season 4 episodes?,"I have been trying to rate all the episodes in the show from worst to best, which is actually pretty hard.

The most trouble i've found is with season 4, in my opinion by far the best season. It has so many good episodes i'm unable to say which one is the best.

Especially the episodes, 2, 8, 9 and 10 are hard to put in order.

Right now I would say my list is like this:

1. E10: The Children

2. E2: The Lion and the Rose

3. E9: The Watchers on the Wall

4. E8: The Mountain and the Viper

5. E1: Two Swords

6. E6: The Laws of Gods and Men

7. E7: Mockingbird

8. E5: First of his Name

9. E4: Oathkeeper

10. E3: Breaker of Chains

When Talisa comes into the picture, Catelyn does not tell Robb to man up and keep his promise to the Freys as Ned would have done.  The saddest part, however, was to watch the way Arya and Sansa behaved in Kings Landing.  Ned was entering a dangerous territory when he accepted a position as Hand of the King.

[MAIN SPOILERS] What is the meaning of the Night King and the White Walkers?,"Alright this is a long one. So bear with me and hear it out:

The greatest question in Game of Thrones is simple: What is the meaning of the White Walkers? Many people don’t think twice about their meaning, they have accepted that the WW only service the storyline as simple, mindless, absolute evil beings. Yet this is not consistent with GRRM’s writing style. Most things in this story (everything of importance) have a deeper meaning: every character, every name, even minor details can have hidden truths behind them. These deeper meanings are revealed as twists in the story line, and these reveals are part of the reason GOT is so popular. There are countless examples:

The name’s of the Dragons and the significance of their riders is one of my favorites: Drogon (rode by Dany, named after the man who spurred her real character arc). Rhaegal (presumably will be ridden by Jon, named after his father). Viserion (is killed and “betrays” her for the NK, named after her brother, Viserys, who also betrayed her). GRRM could’ve named them anything but he gave them deeper meanings that included incredible foreshadowing. The same is true for Hodor, he could’ve been named anything, but GRRM used his name as a mechanism to advance the plot. Hell, he could’ve actually made Jon Ned Stark’s bastard and the plot could’ve advanced the exact same way up to this point. But the point is, this is how GRRM writes. Every major plot twist in this story reveals that it is more complicated than we can imagine, Martin has woven these stories incredibly deep and thought of every aspect, and each of these twists are carefully, perfectly foreshadowed so that everything comes together once its revealed, making perfect sense. Which is why the many question marks surrounding the Night Kings actions and intentions lead me to the following conclusion…

My theory is that the NK is not an absolutely evil being, his goal is not to destroy life, his goal is to unite the people of Westeros, whenever they are most divided, by being a common enemy. My theory is not only foreshadowed, but it functions perfectly when thinking about the purpose of the story:

First we must look at why they were created: To protect (The children of the forest) against mankind. We all know they went on to turn on the COTF, and this ended up uniting the COTF and the First Men against the WW. But looking at this from a wide narrative perspective, did they actually fail their duty? Had they done what the COTF wanted, no outcome would have been favorable: Either 1) the First Men defeat the WW and then view the COTF in a much more intensely negative light. Or 2) the WW and Children prevail and take over Westeros, and face threats from foreign invaders for the rest of time until one finally conquers them. Instead, the WW chose to fight both the First men AND the COTF, forcing them to make peace and unite against a common enemy. So in the end, the NK didn’t protect the COTF from mankind, he protected ALL sentient beings from themselves by ending their trivial bullshit wars and creating one that wasn’t just a simple struggle for power.

This is exactly what he’s doing now. Westeros has become a mess again. Greedy lords fighting for power at the expense of their people and even themselves in some instances (RIP Olenna). Simply put, everything that the NK has done in the books and the show can be rationalized by this theory: Every action the NK takes will help the seven kingdoms unite themselves against him. Most of his questionable actions fit perfectly with this theory:

Why didn’t he have his wights chase Bran (a great threat to him) and Meera after Hodor died? He needs Bran as the TER so he can spread the word of the dead coming and so he can assist Jon in the Great War.

Why did the WW spare Sam in S2? The NK knew Sam would go on to discover the significance of Dragon Glass, as well as play a vital role in revealing Jon’s true identity.

Why didn’t he kill Drogon, even though he was significantly closer to him and he is a much stronger dragon? He needed a dragon to break down the wall, but if he had killed Drogon, he would’ve also probably ended up crushing any chance of the living stopping him, considering everyone who will presumably unite the Seven Kingdoms (other than Tyrion) needed Drogon to escape the battle.

The reason he can see these things is because I assume he’s a greenseer (how else can he touch Bran in Bran’s vision?).

From a narrative perspective, this theory works perfect. Before I thought of this theory, I was extremely conflicted. By the end of season 7 we don’t know who the true antagonist is. Is it the NK or is it Cersei? I believe there is a single answer to that question, and I believe it’s Cersei. She has one of the highest airtimes in the show so we have been able to observe why and how she develops into the monster she is today. We know and understand her better than the NK, and at this point I believe she has, and will continue to, become the embodiment of absolute evil, and the downfall of humanity. She doesn’t represent a supernatural evil, or magical threat to humanity like the NK. She represents a very real tangible evil and greed that we have seen throughout real-life history and still see today. This evil, evil and greed among the human race is actually the biggest threat to humanity. Cersei is the antagonist, she embodies “The Game of Thrones”, or “The Wheel” Dany references, she perpetuates the suffering of the common people in an effort to keep herself and her family in power. The NK being the main antagonist as a totally evil being would be too simple, and wouldn’t work as a metaphor for the story (we know GRRM uses his stories as real-life metaphors, and his stories definitely aren’t simple). Anyways, at this point in the story Jon and Dany are heading North to fight the NK, indicating Cersei will probably die last assuming both of them do die.

Lastly: this theory has been foreshadowed. Old Nan says that Bran’s favorite story was always the Story about Bran the Builder, the man who united the living against the dead and through this created peace, and also happened to found the greatest house in the North, House Stark. But the real foresight has been hiding in plain sight since the first scene of the story: the mysterious symbols of the dead. We know the spiral is an ancient COTF symbol they used for rituals. So why would the dead continue to create this symbol? Maybe to show that in the big picture they actually have been doing the COTF’s bidding the whole time: protecting the living against the living themselves. But here’s the kicker: what is the meaning of the “phi” symbol the WWs like to leave around (the circle with the line through it, seen in the opening scene in episode one, and also seen in the caves under Dragonstone)? The symbol phi is an ancient symbol for the golden ratio, it represents universal harmony, creativity, and balance. So if the NK was a purely evil being who wants to destroy all life and completely disrupt universal harmony, why would GRRM associate him so closely with this symbol? Because he doesn’t want to destroy the living, because he isn’t an absolute evil. He wants to scare the living hell out of everyone in Westeros and remind them that the trivial political conflicts they engage in everyday are worthless and costly in the grand scheme of things, and he wants to demonstrate to them the power of a united people. Not only would this be a jaw dropping, perception changing, plot twist. The likes of which we would have never seen, not even in this show. But this would also be a beautifully fitting metaphor that happens to be extremely relevant to our world today. There’s a good chance I’m wrong, but I would be disappointed if the meaning of the NK was as simple as most people think. Yet, knowing George RR Martin’s style and love for using his works as real-life metaphors, I wouldn’t be surprised if I’m close to the mark.

TL/DR: To me it's pretty clear that at this point, the NK is no longer the main antagonist in the story, it's definitely Cersei. This means the NK must have some other meaning. I believe he is not an absolute evil being like most accept he is, but in fact the whole purpose of his life is to help unite the people of Westeros whenever the Game of Thrones becomes too costly (The Long Night, and now).

[EVERYTHING] The Night King's creation and possible foreshadowing.,"   Sorry for formatting. My phone makes it difficult to make new paragraphs more often than not. Now, I was just watching season 6 again and can't help but to be drawn to one scene in particular: the creation of The Night King.

   Bran watched as the Children of the Forest pierce a piece of dragon glass into the heart of a man. A part of me feels as though Bran will draw inspiration from this and come to the realization that, in order to defeat TNK, one must repeat this process with The Children of the Forest....especially if they want to have any chance of coming out victorious. If this dumb theory is correct, it could explain why The Night King seems to have it out for Jon Snow (if he is indeed destined to undergo this ritual). It could, however, be Dany. 

   If it is Dany, it would fit quite nicely into her aspirations of becoming queen and her affinity for granting freedom to those who are enslaved. She ultimately replaces the Night King and, as the ""breaker of chains"", allows for the wight walkers to move onto the peaceful afterlife that has eluded them.

[EVERYTHING] Theory: The Seed Is Strong,"Hi fellow crows, 

&amp;nbsp;

I have a theory about Game of Thrones that has not been well received in the past, but I keep coming back to it for some reason. I want to share it one last time, because on the off chance there turns out to be truth to it, the internet remembers, right? 

&amp;nbsp;

The easiest way I can explain this theory is to use the guide of the spiral symbol that plays such an important role in the series. In other words, I’ll start from the outside (current situation in Westeros) and gradually work my way into the heart of the theory as clearly and concisely as possible. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Westeros is fucked.

&amp;nbsp;

### Westeros is fucked because of the return of magic.

* In case you didn't know, an army of the dead is coming to kill everyone. 

&amp;nbsp;

### At the same time, the return of magic has directly benefited Bran, Daenerys, and Jon. 

* Bran becoming the three-eyed raven and having the ability to warg.

* Daenerys awakening the dragons from stone and being impervious to fire.

* Jon returning from the dead and being able to fight the White Walkers.

&amp;nbsp;

### The return of magic can be traced back to Stannis Baratheon.

* Melisandre first predicted that after a long summer, ""the cold breath of winter shall freeze the seas and the dead shall rise in the North."" She and Stannis worked together to bring black magic back in order to help Stannis' cause. Ever since Stannis' death, Melisandre has talked about how what she did was a terrible mistake, suggesting that she feels partially responsible for Westeros being, again, fucked. 

* Remember this? “My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.” 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; You think some fire god commanded all of that? It was Stannis! Only Stannis. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Because of his connection to the return of magic and the return of magic being terrible for everyone except for these select few characters, I think Stannis is linked to Bran, Daenerys, and Jon.

* In support of this, the red comet, which is associated with the return of magic, only appears in conjunction with their storylines during the episode where we see Stannis for the first time (first Bran at the Godswood, then Daenerys at the Red Waste, then Jon Beyond the Wall, then, finally, Stannis at Dragonstone). 

* The link is strongest between Stannis and Jon when they're together at Castle Black (also seen in details as tiny as the way both characters say the word ""battle""), but it's also suggested in Daenerys' ability to take Dragonstone (and her mastery of the word ""fewer""), as well as Bran's apparent connection to the White Walkers and mysterious significance in the overarching conflict (making Bran's horrifying discovery of the Army of the Dead that much more powerful in retrospect). 

&amp;nbsp;

### Bran, Daenerys, and Jon can also be linked to Cersei — through Tyrion, the Gift. 

* Tyrion visited Bran at Winterfell after his fall and reported back to Cersei about it after. 

* Tyrion advises Daenerys, and helped bring her home safely.  

* Tyrion oversaw Jon's journey to Castle Black and reported back to Cersei about it after, and has been advising Jon since Season 1. 

&amp;nbsp;

### Stannis and Cersei both have emotionally revealing scenes where they talk about a parent’s love for their children and their lack of choice when it’s between their children and everyone else, which sound like responses to Maester Aemon’s “love versus duty” question. They chose love over duty. 

* Maester Aemon: “If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do? ... Love is the death of duty.""

* Stannis’ conversation with Shireen: “...if a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is no choice at all.”

* Cersei’s conversation with Sansa: “...love no one but your children. On that front a mother has no choice.”

&amp;nbsp;

### Therefore, I believe that Stannis and Cersei are the parents of Bran, Daenerys, and Jon, and that they’re the reasons why a) Westeros is fucked and b) those three are still alive.

* GRRM has warned fans repeatedly that he strives to tell stories with morally grey characters/situations, and that good and evil are two sides of the same coin. The ""song of ice and fire"" encapsulates this idea of our least favorite characters being on the same side as our favorites, as well as this idea of both the horrors and wonders of magic. 

* We've been shown time and again that there's always more to the story than it seems. We still have an entire season to go, and a lot of questions need to be answered, which is why I believe there's room for this theory to come to light in the final season.

&amp;nbsp;

### If this theory holds true, then Westeros’ only chance is if Bran, Daenerys, and Jon choose duty over love, potentially sacrificing themselves in the process. This has been foreshadowed in the scenes where Bran, Daenerys, and Jon each venture beyond the Wall to unknown futures. 

* Bran going North of the Wall to find the Three-Eyed Raven 

* Daenerys going North of the Wall in her vision at the House of the Undying 

* Jon going North of the Wall after the Battle at Castle Black

&amp;nbsp;
	
**And that, folks, is how you break the wheel.** 

&amp;nbsp;

You probably don't believe this theory. I don't even want to believe it. Come the dawn, we shall see.

&amp;nbsp;

*In order to keep this post short, I had to omit a great deal of evidence that supports this theory by casting doubt on the generally accepted notions of the story. If you have any questions (like why I believe Cersei would lie to Jaime, or why Bran/Daenerys/Jon would have false identities), just ask.* ",gameofthrones,True,1514495907,2017-12-28

Like are people really needing to be spoon feed are they that...Like What!? However I do like the idea of Bran being responsible for his creation. So maybe instead of Warging into the NK and becoming the NK he instead he goes back in time and speaks/whispers into one of the first men to get him to warn the children (similar to how he calls out to his father in the tower of Joy), and this First man ends up being captured and has Dragonglass pierced into his heart by the children and Bran realises this first man he tried to convince to save the world is the NK.

And that Bran is responsible for his creation, He is the one who caused his creation, he is the one who ultimately led to the NK's creation. So I believe it will go full circle and I picture it is that right after the First man gets turned into the NK he realises he caused his creation and in a full circle the NK arrives at the WF tree and NK kills his unknowing metaphorical creator Bran.",gameofthrones,True,1514519371,2017-12-28

[NO SPOILERS] New GOT viewer - Just started Season 1. Anything I should know of before continuing?,"(NOTICE: Please do not be a selfish jackass and ruin the show for someone who hasn't seen it. You wouldn't like it if someone did that to you. Be a good community member, and respect others wishes. Thank you)

Okay, so I just started Game of Thrones. I recently finished The Last Kingdom (a BBC historical medieval drama), and thought to start this show since it is somewhat similar. I loved the first episode. Sean Bean - who voiced Martin Septim in Oblivion - has an outstanding performance! Ned Stark is my favorite character by far. He reminds me of a Norse warlord. Definitely going to grow on me as the series goes on.

Is there anything that I should know of? I will not be reading the books until I am done with the series. I'd like to know a bit about Ned and his family, the Starks. I have a feeling that I will eventually become a huge fan, this show is like a ten star movie from what I've seen in episode 1. It's in my tastes, being a medieval fantasy fan!

[EVERYTHING] The real secret of the Night King. He broke his oath (Theory),"The real secret of the Night King is in the Night's Watch oath. Falsely it talks about the men at the wall, but the pledge is actually about the Night King itself. 

&gt;""Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come"" 

The Night King is not supposed to be the Enemy of men, but the Shield of men, he is basically breaking his Ethernal oath, by attacking men and entering their realm.

Personally my theory is that the ""Night's Watch"" is the job of the Night King. There must always be a Night king. The one who kills him have to take his place, and serve his duty. Just like the Captain of the flying Dutchman. This ship / realm always need a Captain / King.

The Nights King is the watcher of the darkness and the night. ",gameofthrones,True,1513270965,2017-12-14

[MAIN SPOILERS] Samwell Defeating the Night King?,"I havent heard anyone talk about this point, but I couldve easily missed it as I have not been a fan for that long.

When Samwell goes beyond the wall as part of the Knights Watch there is a scene wherehe is huddled up behind a rock as the NK and WW are approaching. The NK stops next to him, stares him down, and then does nothing to him at all.

Is there any significance to the NK and WW choosing to not kill Samwell and just let him be? Possible foreshadowing? Anyone have anyone to say about this or have any theories about it?",gameofthrones,True,1513308068,2017-12-14
[EVERYTHING] A theory on Bran,"Okay so this is going to sound really crazy but I believe that Bran is going to be the hero of our story and be the one who defeats the NK. We all think it will be Jon or Dany or Jaime or Jorah but I believe it will be none other then our favorite creepy, Green seeing, and not able to use his legs Stark Bran Stark. I believe at the end of the books and show he will be the one who takes down the NK and defeats the WW's. So what evidence do I have for this:

Evidence:

- A lot of people believe that it will be Jon, Dany, or Both who save the day but I believe that is the point. To make us believe they will be the heroes and in reality it will be someone else in this case Bran.

- There is obviously a connection between Bran and the NK. For one Bran saw his origins (or what we are led to believe is his origins) back in S6, Then he was touched by the NK which allowed the NK to find him, Bran can see his armies approaching, and the NK can sense when he is warging into something as seen in S7.

- Jojen was very determined to bring Bran to the three eyed Raven and for a good reason. But what was that reason maybe he knew that Bran was the key to defeating the NK and needed to bring him there so he could be ready.

- Bran I think is obviously very important to the story as he has been given a lot of screentime, He is the very first character to be introduced after the Prologue in the book and the show, and in the show if the showrunners did not know he was that important they would've killed him off in S6.

- Now in Lord of the Rings (the film by the way) after the prologue we are immediately introduced to Frodo and depending on how you look on it Frodo was the main character of the Lord of the Rings. In Game of Thrones after the Prologue Bran is introduced and with this parallel into consideration Bran may be the main hero of our story.

- Now you are probably ""But Darryl Bran was acting creepy last season"" Well this creates another parallel to Frodo as Frodo started acting very creepy when he had the One Ring with him.

- Also it would fit the Bittersweet ending if the hero was someone who became this person who does not seem to have emotion (granted I think Bran still does but you get the point).

- Bran also ironically enough fits part of the AA/The PTWP prophecy. Bran Was reborn admits Salt and Smoke when he emerged from the crypts after WF was attack all those years ago The Salt being salty tears and the Smoke from the chaos, He was under the Red Comet and woke up not too long before it appeared (in S2 by the way if you are curious) making the Red Comet the bleeding Star, If Bran Wargs a Dragon he would in a metaphorical sense have the blood of the Dragon, That Dragon would be his Lightbringer (either that or a Weirwood at the God's Eye), Meera is his Nissa Nissa, and Awakening Dragons for stone could be when he reveals to Jon his true parentage.

- Three Eyed Raven if Bran got touched and knew he was more important then just being a Greenseer and the next three Eyed Raven he would want him to trained/learn as much as possible before the NK could reach the Three Eyed Raven's tree.

- I feel it be fitting that while Bran never became a knight like he dreamed but he ended up not only becoming something more powerful but also became a hero.

Now even if this ends up not being true you have to admit I think that Bran will have a important rule to play in the endgame of the story ",gameofthrones,True,1513308262,2017-12-14

[EVERYTHING] Galla Placidia: The Inspiration for Daenerys Targaryen?,"I was listening to Mark Duncan's History of Rome podcast, which I highly recommend to any and all, and I started to learn about the exciting life and times of one Aelia Galla Placidia and couldn't help but notice the parallels between her story and that of Daeny. Now, George R. R. Martin is a well known student of history and has talks about dozens of different influences and sources he's pulled from to make various characters and events. But I haven't been able to find anyone else mention this anywhere else, so I wanted to share some of her story.

Aelia Galla Placidia was the grand daughter of the Emperor Valentinian the Great on her mother's side and the daughter of the Emperor Theodosius the Great and half-sister to the Emperors Arcadius and Honorius. She was born in 388AD and was in Rome when King Alaric of the Visigoths showed up and began besieging it. Through means and reasons unknown, Placidia ended up captured by said barbarian horde before they ended up famously sacking Rome in 410AD. She was carted around with them for a while until Alaric died and Ataulf became king. Ataulf was trying to find a place for the Visigoths in the Roman empire and after killing off the right people to win the Emperor Honorius' favor, married her in a lavish ceremony. So, woman of imperial blood married to a barbarian king, sound familiar?

But it gets better. Not for Ataulf sadly. Galla Placidia only had one child with Ataulf, a baby named Theodosius, which Ataulf certainly hoped would cement his people's bloodline in the Imperial court. This child would not live past it's first year and die tragically when Placidia was 27. That same year, Ataulf would be assassinated in the bath by a rival tribe member leaving a power vaccuum. First born son and husband die tragically before their time? Check.

The Visigoths were momentarily ruled by the assassin's brother, Sigeric. I say momentarily because he's only recorded as ruling for approximately a week. Sigeric apparently treated Placidia terribly because of her ties to the old king and reportedly made her walk 12 miles on foot while chained up to his horse, along with several other slaves. Being chained up and treated like dirt by the same people who she had once been the queen of? Check.

Sigeric was murdered and replaced by Wallia who quickly surrendered himself to Constantius III, the effective ruler behind the throne of Honorius. Placidia was returned to the royal court in exchange for rights to settle in Roman territory and food. Placidia was then married off to Constantius III, apparently at the request of Honorius, but she apparently hated the idea of marrying him. 

She didn't hold much sway, being a woman in these times, and suffered through the marriage. She had two kids with him, one of whom would end up being the Emperor one day. Valentinius. Through various political machinations I won't get into because this post is already really long, Constantius III was named Augustus of the Western Empire and she gained the title of Augusta at the age of 33. Following the suit of Ataulf sadly, Constantinius would die in less than a year. After some weird incestuous bout with her brother, the emperor Honorius (even more familiar considering how Viserys treated her), she packed up and left to Constantinople. 

A lot of complicated things happen up to this point, but I'll cut to the chase and say that eventually Placidia found herself as the Queen Regent for Emperor Valentinian III while he was underage. This set her as the acting ruler of the Western Roman Empire for 12 whole years which she apparently maneuvered deftly and wisely. So, going from a captured bride who was sold off for grain to one of the most powerful and influential figures in the western world? Pretty familiar.

So there all that is. Obviously, I have no direct quote from George R. R. Martin saying ""this was an inspiration,"" but there's enough correlations between their stories that makes it kinda hard to believe that he didn't at least read up on her before writing the books. I really like finding these inspirations in history and there are already so many I've found listening to the History of Rome. I might write something up for the other ones I've found if I have the time. ",gameofthrones,True,1513375154,2017-12-15

What I actually think will happen: I predict a Lord of the Rings type of ending, with the good guy (Jon) winning but the effects still lingering on giving a bittersweet feeling. This would entail that Dany dies either in battle or giving birth. Jamie kills Cersei and also dies at some point while the Night King is barely defeated.

I feel like it wouldnt be emotionally rewarding to have Arya killing Cersei and Im curious about the fans who consistently say Arya will kill her. Is it just because of the list? Are there subtle clues I didnt catch pointing to it? Why would you like to see that happen?",gameofthrones,True,1513448086,2017-12-16

[MAIN SPOILERS] Game of Thrones Theory: Daenerys Rebirth (Hints in the Books/Show),"-&gt;Daenerys will die in battle against the white walkers, but is resurrected after being burned&lt;-

Here is how/why:
Remeber Jamies monologue while having a bath with Brienne?:

Jamie:"" First, I killed the pyromancer,and then when the king turned to flee I drove my sword into his back.""Burn them all"", he kept saying.""Burn them all."" I DONT THINK HE EXSPECTED TO DIE. HE MEANT TO BURN WITH THE REST OF US AND RISE AGAIN REBORN AS A DRAGON AND TURN HIS ENEMIES TO ASH. I slit his throat to make sure that didn`t happen.""

So the theory is that this exactly will happen after she has died and been burned. She already has shown that she is a ""real"" dragon unlike other characters who have claimed this for themselves e.g. Rhaegar ""the last dragon"", Aerys the Mad King and viserys -&gt; but unfortunately ""he was no dragon. fire cannot kill a dragon"" :) . But it could give Rebirth to a dragon, just like the burning stake for Khal Drogo gave life to Daenerys dragons. And after her cremation Daenerys will turn into a ""REAL"" dragon and fight the last battle against the white walkers, maybe killing Viserion and the Night King and maybe die again...",gameofthrones,True,1513468723,2017-12-16
[EVERYTHING] Tyrion in Season 8,"I feel like after everything that has happened in Season 7 with his mistakes, I don't think he's going to be in a very good place mentally at the beginning of the last season. I think after he let his queen; Dany down with his mistakes, after noticing that he is already being replaced by Jon as the person she listens to the most and with failing to win over Cersei's support in the Great War. I think he is going to be very unsure himself again bringing him back to how he was in the beginning of Season 5.

I just can't help but feel bad for him throughout the entire time I was watching Season 7, he wanted to win the war against his family with minimal amount of violence as possible where they'd be forced to surrender. But when none of that works, it only starts to divide him away from both sides more and more. I can only imagine the emotional roller coaster he must be on.

I really would like to think that the writers did all of this with them knowing what they have planned for him, one where it doesn't involve him leaving Dany's side for his sister's (which seems very illogical and OOC IMO) and involves him redeeming himself for his failures coming out of it in a way that really benefits him and Dany. 

I think while S7 focused a lot on how much Dany can trust him and where his loyalties lay, I think his story in S8  will focus on his redemption and how much he really means to Dany.",gameofthrones,True,1513480139,2017-12-16
"[EVERYTHING] A Theory/Prediction on Jon, Sansa, and Daenerys.","Okay so with being revealed to be named Aegon I think it is possible we may see a parallel between Jon and Aegon NOT the conquering part but I think in who he marries. Yes I believe he will have two wives just as Aegon the Conqueror had his sister wives Rhaeneys and Visenya. Now the first one is of course Daenerys who I think is the Rhaeneys of this for one her name sounds like Rhaeneys (Daenerys Rhaeneys) so I think Jon will marry Daenerys and she will be pregnant with his child.

But who is the Visenya....Well I believe it will be Sansa, Why well for one Sansa name sounds like Visenya (Sansa VisenyA), Also let's think about how the last few seasons have gone between her and Jon, For one in the original outline Arya and Jon were to fall in love and Sansa and Jon's reunion felt more like a couple reuniting rather then siblings, Also when they are near the fire place the lightings says it all as it is lite like a romantic scene sort of, Also I want to bring up a interesting parallel.

Jon when to Dragonstone to meet with Dany who he would later fall in love with, Dragonstone has Dragon in it's names and Dragons in the story represent Fire, When Jon reunited with Sansa in last year's season they were at the Wall which guards against the WW's, The WW's represent Ice in the story. Jon meets Dany in Dragonstone (fire) and Jon and Sansa reunite at the Wall (Ice). Also there is a very great post that my friend DarrylthedudeWayne made awhile back I will leave a link to it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/61b97a/everything_my_theory_on_sansa/

In that he mentions that Jon got the Pink Letter from Ramsey he at first does not want to go but is convinced by Sansa, Maybe Jon did not do it just for family love but may have saw something in Sansa he has not seen before. Also fair to mention when Jon and Sansa argued in this season it sounded like couples arguing in my opinion and also the show has made visual parallels between them and Ned and Cat, Speaking of Which all the way back in the first book of the series (and also the first season) Ned tells Sansa when they return to WF (if they return) He will pair her up with someone more fitting Honorable, Gentle, Strong. Jon is Honorable, Gentle, and Strong depending on how you look at it.

Now before I continue I just want to say I don't think Arya will be Jon's Visenya for a lot of reasons but mainly because 1. Arya is way too young and Jon I don't think would be comfortable marrying someone who is like a kid 2. Arya and Jon have seen each other as Brother and Sister as Jon was her fav sibling but Jon and Sansa have never been that close meaning they probably never saw each other as real siblings 3. If Arya is too end up with anyone in the story it would most likely be Gendry and 4. In the first season the line that Ned said to Arya you will marry a King and rule his castle was change too you will marry a High Lord and rule his castle meaning if Jon is king at the end he is not the High Lord but Gendry would be a High Lord if he is legitimized.

But the fact that the original outline had a Stark on Snow/Targaryen romance could mean that GRRM and maybe D&amp;D will retool that into a romance between Jon and Sansa. Finally if Jon marries Dany and Sansa he have control over the north and also all of Dany's allies. Now for Dany there has been forshadowing that Dany would marry Jon I will not get into all of it but I will mainly focus on the forshadowing in the show and the books from the House of the Undying. When Dany goes into there she has visions one of them being a WF Blue Rose on a thing of Ice this could mean the son of Lyanna is at the wall, Also in the show Dany has a vision beyond the wall where she enters a tent where she meets Drogo could this symbolize her love (NOT Drogo but Jon) beyond the wall as Jon was beyond the wall at this point in the story.

Finally for both of these Jon's true Targaryen name is Aegon. So if my theory is true next season Jon may marry Dany at a Weirwood in the White Harbor (if they are that madly in love) and she will be pregnant with his child, and later he will marry Sansa maybe Sansa will also be pregnant with his child, and like Aegon had his sister wives Jon will have his aunt and cousin wives. However it will not last long as Dany will either die in childbirth or not die in childbirth but will be sacrifice to forge lightbringer, Jon and Sansa would be king and queen of the Seven Kingdoms with Jon and Dany's child being heir to the throne and Jon and Sansa's children being Heir to WF.",gameofthrones,True,1513480487,2017-12-16

Had he not killed those prisoners Robb would have never had to kill him for treason, and, after all, killing those squires wouldn't have been productive at all. No, your son isn't coming back to life if you kill them. No, your troops won't get Jaime Lannister sooner if you do that.

[TV] Why didn't D&amp;D focus on plots they didn't film when they didn't have TWOW?,"We've all seen how much of a mess D&amp;D made of Dorne, probably because they didn't have enough episodes to fill in the complexities of Dorne in the books, but there's one thing I don't understand. We all know how many important plots in the books weren't televised by D&amp;D, but if they were finding it hard to write episodes without The Winds of Winter during Season 6 and 7, why didn't they just focus on plots that they didn't do, like Aegon Targaryen's invasion, or the Martells' revenge for 1 or 2 seasons until GRRM finished The Winds of Winter, then they would be able to use the last novel to create one of the greatest final seasons of any TV programme with the amazing, astonishing style of GRRM's writting.

[S7] Ghost,"It's been a while since S7, but I'm still pissed off that Ghost was not in S7 at all. Jon is the only one to still have his direwolf by his side, which should be important. Ghost is a character, as far as I'm concerned, and he is more than just Jon's pet. He is far less expendable than the writers and directors treated him.

The writers and directors of the show have said it would have been too expensive and difficult to put Ghost in, but that is total bs. Arya's direwolf, Nymeria, makes an appearance in S7 and looks pretty realistic as far as I'm concerned. So the 'creating a realistic giant wolf with visual effects is too hard' excuse seems like a cop out to me.

As far as budget goes, I think there was plenty of room for Ghost after some adjustments. I could've done without the polar bear scene. Some might disagree with me on that point, but if given the choice - Ghost or the polar bear - I'd pick Ghost without hesitation.

I'm hoping to see more of Ghost in S8. With the scale of GoT's final season, I think it is very likely that we do.",gameofthrones,True,1513550122,2017-12-17

[MAIN SPOILERS] Olenna's Wardrobe.,"I know a lot of the wardrobe in Game of Thrones gets helluva lot of praise (Cersei's armor embroidered gowns, Dany's dragon accessories, Sansa's furs, etc). However, despite how great those are, I think the one that I like most was the drastic switch of Olenna's ensembles from seasons 3x3-6x7 to 6x10-7x3.

We were accustomed to her wearing the greens, yellows/golds, blues, and a number of assorted colors that correlate with House Tyrell/The South. Yet once the main branch of her family gets burned alive in the Sept of Baelor does her attire take a turn for almost an entirety of blacks. It's very clear it's meant to emphasize her being in mourning, and it lasts from the moment she hears the news up until her own death, but I also enjoy the thought that it's very much a liking to a withered rose.

I enjoy the series's use of the color black for empowerment and dominance, especially for the likes of Dany and even Cersei, but I also enjoy the mourning/tragedy aspect it holds true with Olenna. I'll always feel upset about the missed opportunity that D&amp;D had with her discovering what happened to her family, but the wardrobe alone (along with the wonderful Dame Diana Rigg's acting) provides more than enough emotion to make up for it.",gameofthrones,True,1513557359,2017-12-17
[NO SPOILERS] Something about the show!? Looking for vindication re: actors' mispronunciation of a certain word,"EDIT: SOLVED!  See Edit 2 below for dramatic conclusion.  Hint: I was right!  And I was wrong.  Which one more so, though?  Wrong, I was more wrong 

- - -


So I mentioned this a long time ago and everyone sneered at me for failing to understand the concept of accents.  But after another rewatch, I'm beyond convinced that I wasn't crazy.

We all know there are characters in GOT known as maesters; they're the castles' resident bookkeepers, scientists, healers, confidants, usually all-around good bros (except Pycelle).

So for the entirety of the first season and most of the second, everyone on the show pronounces it ""MYE-ster"", to rhyme with ""scheister"" and ""mice fur"". 
But somewhere before season 3 they start pronouncing it the way they have since: ""MAY-ster"", which rhymes with ""baster"" and ""face fur"". 

So my question is: did anyone else notice this?  Will someone please confirm I'm not losing my mind?  Or will you disagree again, and call me ridiculous names like ""obsessive"" and ""weird"" and ""who gives a shit dude""?

Thanks.  Please help.  

Edit: I'm going to open up the damned .srt files, ctrl-f 'maester', check em in video, and post the results.  I realize this maester up some negative feelings but I need to know the truth that killed Jon Arryn

- - -

Edit 2: Well folks.   As u/aardvarkyardwork has said, both pronunciations did happen, but I was wrong, there was no split point where they corrected pronunciation, with 100% version A before, and B after.  I just went through Season 1 checking maesters, and the final count stood at 17 mentions, with 12 being Mayster, 5 Myster.  Only one was tricky, with Bran jumping over the word quickly, but I had to give it to Mayster anyway.  

So there you have it.  I now can say with confidence that 1. I know the uncomfortable feeling of being proven wrong about something after being absolutely sure of it before, and 2. I just wasted probably 20 minutes of my life proving to eight strangers online how much of a fool I am.  With that said, it's not a total washout... more than a third of the maesters actually were the wrong pronunciation.  So there's that. 

Time to go commit seppuku, I'm a man of my word.  You think my life is some precious thing to me?!  I'm not gonna kill myself.  Not because of this, at least. ",gameofthrones,True,1513564243,2017-12-17

[MAIN SPOILERS] Is Tyrion...,"a Targaryen? I️k this may seem crazy to some but I️ was reading more about this popular fan theory and was curious to see if most of you thought the same. People believe that Joanna, wife of Tywin Lannister and mother of Jaime and Cersei and Tyrion (as we know), had an affair with the Mad King. The mad king had always had infatuation over her and maybe it’s possible that he took her, either with force or not, and that resulted in Tyrion. Making Tyrion a Targaryen and half-brother to Daenerys and uncle to Jon. Some clues were hinted such as Tywin saying before he was killed by Tyrion “You are no son of mine” because he really wasn’t his son and the dragons allowing him to touch them and free them in Ep 6.02. There’s a lot of evidence that goes against this too, like why doesn’t Bran know and if he was a Targaryen why didn’t Tywin kill him as a baby.

[MAIN SPOILERS] Jonsa marriage symbolism:,"In the show the blue winter rose (symbolising Lyanna and Jon) only shows up a couple of times -

*The first time it shows up is when Robert wants to kill the rest of the Targaryens -
 
1 [Robert and Ned](http://78.media.tumblr.com/0084d64485e62eaed21a50cd24e10973/tumblr_inline_oxyb8kW02y1uko8lz_500.png)

Its almost as if Jon is in background behind Ned and Ned is in front, protecting Jon from Robert.

The second time it shows up is when Varys and Littlefinger are talking about power and ruling -

2 [Varys and Littlefinger] (http://78.media.tumblr.com/3af889d6f2eda5001cb5b15cc2ee67dc/tumblr_inline_oxyb8lFSWH1uko8lz_500.png)

This symbolises that Jon is the rightful heir to the iron throne and he should be the one wielding power.

The third time it shows is when Dany is in her house of undying visions -

3 [Dany in the throne room] (http://78.media.tumblr.com/7ce8801089ebeb711ba57d83d8b5789d/tumblr_inline_oxyb8l9P2s1uko8lz_500.png)

The blue winter rose is shown in the throne room as well as *snow* (Or ash from burning the red keep being burnt I don't know) covering the floor. This once again shows that Jon is the rightful king.

Lastly we have Sansa being cloaked...

4 [Sansa in the throne room] (http://78.media.tumblr.com/5aff3c17be444210b053d3ab144ad102/tumblr_inline_oxyb8lnloZ1uko8lz_500.png)

Cloaking symbolises marriage and in Westeros its a common marriage tradition. We see Sansa being cloaked with the blue winter rose (Jon) right behind her. 

The book version is Sansa getting covered with a white (colour of snow) cloak stained by fire and blood, words of house Targaryen...

[MAIN SPOILERS] S7 The Gold Wagon,"Question: What happened to the gold after the Lannister forces were destroyed by Dany and her dragon? We clearly see Jaime open up the wagon full of gold and give Bronn his cut. Directly afterwards, the Lannister force is set upon by Dany and her forces which resulted in a complete defeat. Later, we can see the Dothraki sifting through the spoils and the entire Lannister force being forced to bend the knee. It would seem unlikely that a single wagon could have slipped out of the massacre unnoticed, making it's way all the way back to King's Landing without a guard.

In the same episode, we see Cersei talking with the Iron Bank rep and she is assuring him that the debt is being paid in full with interest and the gold is on it's way (in the wagon). The Iron Bank rep says multiple times that she will have the backing of the bank ONCE the debt is payed and not before.

At the end of S7, Cersei says that she wants to let the Northern forces fight the Walkers alone and then mop up whats left. Jaime protests her and asks how she intends to do this. She says she has the Iron Bank at her back and intends to buy the Golden Sun mercenaries to fight for her and bolster her forces. Jaime flees in horror to join the Northern Forces.

How exactly does she intend to pay for the mercs if she never received the gold, thus never receiving the backing of the Iron Bank? If the gold did arrive, how the hell did it manage to escape the ambush of the Lannister forces by Dany's forces?

Is this a major plot hole or did I miss something?

[EVERYTHING] Why does Cersei REALLY hate Tyrion? Is it as simple as what she claims?,"In Season 7, Cersei hated Tyrion because he killed their father, Tywin, which set all sorts of bad things in motion for the Lannisters. But Cersei's hatred of Tyrion was first voiced early in the first season (IIRC) when she revealed that he ""killed"" their mother during his birth. Cersei is about 10 years older than Tyrion and even if she believed that as a 10 year-old, I doubt someone with her upbringing would continue to believe that a newborn was responsible for a death during childbirth as she got older. There has to be another reason, *I think*.

Was it to do with Tyrion ""bad-mouthing"" Cersei to Tywin about a servant-girl who stole a necklace?

Was it something else?

In the books... I don't think Stannis and Mel were bumping uglies. I think Stannis' motivations on the surface were to save the realm, follow the laws and act justly.

In the books I find Samwell to be a kinder character, while in the show he seems to be more motivated by sex. In the show he's constantly talking about how he misses women and wants to have sex and on and on. But in the books, while he does touch on these subjects it's not a major motivating factor for him. I think it changes the tone of his character a lot. 

Like, in the books, when he gets to Craster's keep and he helps out Gilly, I very much feel that he helped out Golly because he's a kind person and felt sympathy for her and her situation. In the show it feels like he helps Gilly because he wants to get laid. 

He does more or less all the same stuff, so far, it just seems like his motivations are different.",gameofthrones,True,1513706732,2017-12-19

[EVERYTHING] I think it would be anticlimactic,"If the Night King and the Army of the Dead don't make it to King's Landing and are killed off in the first half of Season 8. It would be so much more interesting if everyone did end up being involved in the Great War in some way (Cersei included even though it's not by choice). I feel like people are only focused on the idea (the characters as well) that the North will be their primary target before moving on to other locations in Westeros. 

I think the Night King will only send enough wights to take on the forces that are gathering together at Winterfell to distract them, while he himself along with Viserion and the rest of his soldiers will head to a location that has a very big population (King's Landing). I guess I'm just eager to see elephants as wights since Cersei is having Euron bring the Golden Company to the city, but coincidentally she's only brought the Night King more soldiers for his army.

All this just seems more interesting to me, then Cersei being the 'final' boss. It just makes it feel as if this 7 season build up of the WW threat would be wasted if they were already dealt with in the first half of the last season rather than being a dangerous conflict for all the living characters in the entire season.",gameofthrones,True,1512331526,2017-12-03

[EVERYTHING] A Theory on Khal Drogo,"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before. This is the prophecy of Mirri Maz Duur and what has lead me to believe that Khal Drogo could return in the final season. Now before I begin the show has past the books and I will be mainly using evidence from the show so this will be a show only discussion.

Okay so first when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east I think actually means the SON sets in the west and rises in the east. Sun=Son the Son is Jon Snow, When the seas go dry could refer to Euron and the Ironborn, And the Mountains blow in the wind like leaves could refer to the mountain beyond the wall or the eastwatch falling (which can also refer to the seas going dry) or maybe something later in the Story like Cleganebowl (Get Hyped). Baring a living child refers to Dany most likely being pregnant with Jon's child which would finally lead to Khal Drogo's return.

Now this is where things get interesting because I think when Khal Drogo returns (which I can imagine being him stepping out of a hearthfire in Dragonstone or maybe stepping out of a Pyre similar to how his body left the world) I don't think it will all be happy and stuff. I believe if he does return he will be pissed that Dany had hooked up with Jon and had a child with him and will probably become a villain. Perhaps try to kill Jon and Dany due to Dany ""Betraying him"" for Hooking up with Jon maybe he will side with Cersei and will marry Cersei (let's hope if that is the case she can calm him just as Dany did).

Or maybe he will be Azor Ahai even though I don't believe that. But personally this is just a tinfoil theory I have and I don't think it will actually happen but it is fun to theorize.",gameofthrones,True,1512355559,2017-12-03

I get the fact that she still believes her “truce” with Cersei is still going on, and also that she has seen the possibility Night King’s army, or maybe even her love for Jon. But those still don’t seem like enough of motivation for her.

Hello redditors and GOT fans,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1512428172,2017-12-04
[EVERYTHING] What Happened Before Season 1 of the Show and General Questions about Everything.,"I'm kinda new to the show and still had a couple questions about the Show and books. So I kinda just want to know what happened before season 1 other than Robert's Rebellion. I have watched a few of the actor narrated animated videos but i'm not a big fan of those. So if you want, you can answer all of them or just one. Thanks.

-What was before Aegon's Conquest in Westeros? (Government, people, houses etc) 

-Stuff about the fighting between The First Men, The Children of The Forrest, and The Andals. What came first, why were they fighting, how was it resolved or was it even really resolved?

-What was Valyria all about and why is it the way it is? 

-When did magic disappear in Westeros. Meaning when did all the dragons, giants, children of the Forrest, and other magical being die off or disappear in mainland Westeros. (Up north is kinda different since nobody really travels up there and makes it back down living) 

-What was the main religions in Westeros prior to Aegon and during the Targaryen dynasty?

-Did previous religions have things like faith militants or armies? 

-Wildling wars with the Nights Watch. I think Jon told Ygritte there have been like 7 or 9. When did they happen and to what scale. (Like the season 4 war was maybe 100 Nights Watch against 100,000 Wildlings)

-Geographical Things like how the Children formed the Neck and other areas.

-Why/How/When were White Walkers created? (Do we even know?) Also how big was their army against Azor Ahai a couple thousand years ago during the long night?

-How was the Nights Watch formed? 

-How was the Wall created?

-How is Essos governed, or is it even governed at all?

[EVERYTHING] Battle of Winterfell,"Okay so I think it is save to say there may be a battle at Winterfell and in the North but how will it go down. Well for one I think there will be a big battle between Jon and Dany's forces and the NK's forces before they can reach KL but it will be brutal and I think it will result in the deaths of Bronn, Ghost (Sacrificing himself to save Jon), Tormund (if he lives to this point), Grey Worm and most of the Unsullied, Yohn Royce, and most of the Northern lords. I also think both sides will have heavy casualties and Jon and Dany forces will fall back.

I also think back at WF anyone who can't fight will be evacuated too one of two places The Vale and the Riverlands. Sansa, Sam, Gilly, Missendei, Meera (if she is even in S8 and those rumors are not true), Brienne (to protect Sansa), Pod, Lyanna Mormont, and Bran stay at WF helping evacuate or (in Bran's case) warging into one of Dany Dragons. However I think the WW's will reach WF but Jaime, Beric, Arya, and Gendry will make it back there too get them out but Brienne will stay to hold off the last Wagon (which contains all the characters I just mentioned or maybe Tyrion comes in on Rhaegal to get them out) and Brienne will hold off the WW's and Wights breaking down the gates as they escape on the Wagon to the Riverlands.

It is also possible one of the Stark girls could stay but I think all three starks will live.",gameofthrones,True,1512434270,2017-12-04

[MAIN SPOILERS] Some SIGNIFICANT details that should be important in S8,"1: Cersei is either not pregnant, or will never have her baby.

-The witch she visited said she'd only have three children (Joffrey, Tommen, Myrcella), so I feel it is likely she dies, or is humanized (A LITTLE BIT, SOMEHOW) and her child dies.

2: Jon Snow is not the heir to the iron throne

-Rheagar died before Jon was born, so the the heir would become Vicerys, and then Dany after he died.

3: Tyrion could definitely be the reborn ""Azor Ahai"" 

-based on the fact that he (as did Azor Ahai) already killed his lover Shae, and ""awakened the dragons"" when he approached and touched them in their chains, after this they were magically tamed.

4: If instead Jamie were the reborn prince (likely, since it is very realistic he could kill Cersei)

-the"" awakening dragons from stone"" doesn't entirely fit, but I read an *unconfirmed* post claiming there is a painting or drawing of Azor Ahai with his sword in his left hand while all the others in the depiction were right-handed (someone please find this to confirm).",gameofthrones,True,1512442551,2017-12-04

[NO SPOILERS] GoT themed cat names,"
Hey!

I just rescued a 10 year old Russian Blue and the shelter didn't have a name for him. He's kind of timid and only likes certain people, but once he warms up to you he's a real lover. He also loves to hide in secluded, small, dark places. I was thinking of naming him after one of the Targaryens, but I'm not sure.

Anyone have any suggestions?

[EVERYTHING] Varys,"*""Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said? Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?""* - Kinvara to Varys, S6 E5 

Heading into the final six episodes where presumably most foreshadowing has already been laid out in the previous 77, is it possible that this conversation holds a deeper importance to Varys' role in the Great War? I know, it's a stretch but seriously, what did that voice say and why was it worth mentioning? Just to freak Varys out a bit? Kinvara does mention 'there's still so much' Varys doesn't know - and it seems Melisandre is in the loop as well. 

*""I have to die in this strange country, just like you.""* - Melisandre to Varys, S7 E3

My guess is Varys' death will be important to the plot, maybe somehow linked to the Lord of Light as a payoff to that repeatedly mentioned story of how he was cut. A lot of secondary characters are going to die next season but the writers decided to explicitly foreshadow Varys' out of all others.  *tinfoil hat off*

[EVERYTHING] A thought/prediction I had for next season,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1512483451,2017-12-05
[EVERYTHING] Gendry's true parentage,"A couple of years ago there was a fan theory trending through the internet: Gendry being the son of Robert and Cersei.

This possibility banished later on, but I still think it would've been a great reveal. In the show, Cersei states she and Robert did have a son, who died. Not Jaime's but actually Robert's. He either died before birth or soon after. I think this whole thing is never mentioned in the books (not that I remember).

Fans theorized maybe Varys took him away and faked his death, to have a heir to the throne in his pocket just in case he ever needed one. Or maybe Cersei tried getting rid of him as he reminded her of Robert and she didn't want him, maybe she only wanted to have kids with Jaime (she's always felt quite proud about those kids being her brother's).

Imagine this: if this had turned out to be true, and Gendry and Cersei had eventually been told about the truth, everything would change. Cersei would have a non-bastard son to take care of and even love if she wanted to. Stannis would no longer have a claim on the throne, as Robert's real son sat on it. He would probably even serve Gendry; after all, he'd be a Baratheon and the Heir to the Iron Throne. I think Stannis would be satisfied with seeing a true Baratheon wearing the crown.

And this is the biggest deal: Jon Snow and Gendry would probably become enemies. When Jon finds out he's Rhaegar's son he COULD claim the throne, although I don't think he would. Jon does, however, support Daenerys, who people think is the heir after her family's death, which would technically make Jon and Daenerys rivals to Gendry. Gendry's father overthrew the Targaryens and now our main characters are supporting a Targaryen who claims the throne on the basis that she's a Targaryen. And Cersei would be on Gendry's side here. And Stannis.

I would have LOVED to see Gendry, Cersei and Stannis against Daenerys, Jon and the rest. The conflict would be much more heartbreaking, and even would make more sense.",gameofthrones,True,1512485809,2017-12-05
[MAIN SPOILERS] How are these guys killed?,"These guys I mean the undead army in the white walkers army. I have a few questions. I used to think every undead and the white walkers were only killable with fire or dragonglass. Then in the penultimate episode of s7, John and his pals kill like a hundred of them and a the hound wasn't using dragonglass, valerian steel, or a flaming sword. Brings me to my next question isn't valerian steel able to kill them as well? I remember john taking one out with his longclaw, why didn't he tell the lannisters during their finale meeting that val steel  can kill them? He demonstrated dragonglass and fire but not that steel. 

So if someone could explain, can anything kill the undead but only those 3 things can kill white walkers?  And one more thing, how many white walkers are there? I've only ever seen like 6 of them but read an article saying there's probably 100 white walkers each commanding 1000 undead to make an army of 100,000 undead.

The board consists of hexes which show where the resource came from (ex: wool comes from a field of sheep, lumber comes from forest, etc.) so for my game I was thinking the hexes could be different locations in the show, such as Braavos for gold, and Dorne for wine, etc. but those are the only two good ""resources"" I have come up with so far that have a particular location tied to them. I also wanted to incorporate ravens and horses as possible resources but I don't know what the hexes would be for those.

"[EVERYTHING] the three heads of the dragon theory - why just because the dragon must have three heads, doesn't mean those heads have to be on the same side.","So the dragon must have three heads. We know this. We also know there are 3 dragons and thus there must me 3 dragon riders. The common theory is that it's dany, Jon, and Tyrion or Jamie or Arya or whoever the fuck else making up the third head.... 

But hold on a minute. 

None of those people are dragon riders. 

**Dany rides the dragon named for the man she loved.** 

**Jon will likely ride the dragon named for the brother she admired.**

**And The Night King rides the dragon named for the brother who betrayed her.**

The three heads of the dragon are Jon, Dany, and the Night King. 

What this could mean is that the Night King, in his human life, may have been a distant relation to the Targaryens, or was perhaps a Targaryen himself. 

Dragonriding is a thing that historically only Targaryens could do. That cannot be a coincidence then - the guy who is the Night King just happens to know how to ride a dragon? Just because he can control it doesn't mean he can ride it. That shit ain't easy. 

So that's my theory. ",gameofthrones,True,1512587248,2017-12-06

“Did you have a nice dream? You must dream of wonderful days… beautiful moments… so do I. I often dream of you.

It feels like that more and more.

One day… I’ll have to tell you many stories. Where the scar on your uncle’s face came from, where to my hand went, about Brienne… about your mother. I don’t know if I want to talk about your siblings much…. I don’t want you to be just a little as sad as I am whenever I think of them. Maybe some stories about people being brave, or strong, of great adventures and battles… and how thankfull I am that no one has come here yet to ask me to endure all these things again.

So many people fought for so many things… even for that our family can live here once again, and in peace. Maybe you’ll have to fight as well when you’re older, probably many times … life doesn’t know that one needs rest, that’s what I learned. But when it comes to that… remember… not to let them convince you what is worth fighting for. You got to convince yourself.”

[MAIN SPOILERS]I just binged on all 7 seasons. My complaint with Season 7.,"Let me start off by saying that pacing is an issue on this show.  It's agonizingly slow at times, but Season 6 and particularly 7 accelerated that pace to the point that its created some missteps.  My biggest complaint is after 6 Seasons of watching Daenerys Targaryen build her army,  Season 7 should have been her time to shine.   My biggest complaint is that her storyline converged with Jon Snows and they forced a romance between the two.   She should have taken the Iron Throne from Cercei *AND THEN* united with Jon Snow and fought off the army of the dead in Season 8 with him.   The romance is fan servicey but doesn't work.  Jon's characterization is not a guy who knocks on the door wanting sex, and she is not the type to fall in love.   The end game should have been the two of them *finally* crossing paths and becoming good friends/allies, but they put all of their eggs into one basket with Season 7 and are rushing to the finish line now.

[MAIN SPOILERS] Jon And Daenerys,"In season 7 episode 5 there comes a scene where Daenerys gives Randyll and Dickon Tarly the choices to bend the knee or be burned alive. Why this is significant to Jon and Daenerys relationship
Randyll and Dickon Tarly are the father and brother of Jons best friend Samwell Tarly. In season 6 episode 6 we see Sam interact with abusive, berating Randyll Tarly which some might argue that it would not effect Jon and Danys relationship because Sam must be ok with his father being burned alive because he was abusive towards him and will just give Daenerys a pass for burning him for not bending the knee which is simply not logical, as it was his father and his sibling. Jon has always been protective of Samwell since his joining in the nights watch and would be horrified by the pain that Daenerys has caused him over the loss of his family members, as Jon has known Samwell for years and Daenerys only days.

I haven't heard anyone talk about this fact and would like to hear other opinions on it because it seems like it would significantly effect their relationship as a whole in a bad way. Looking to hear others opinions on it.",gameofthrones,True,1512708061,2017-12-07

[Everything] Theory: Why was jaqen h'ghar in the black cells?,"So I know that it has been a really long time since it was relevant but I came up with a solid reason for jaqen h'ghar being in the black cells.

For this theory to work 2 unconfirmed things would have to be true:
1) Varys is a blackfyre supporter
2) He knew abour R+L=J

My theory is that Varys hid jaqen h'ghar in the black cells to get him to the wall, and have him assasinate Jon Snow

Varys support Dany and her brother to get a second mad king on the show and than have the realm be rescued by Aegon (who I think is a Blackfyre in some way).
A plan which would probably fail if the true heir would still be alive (namely Jon Snow).

The only other people who knew about Jons parents are Ned Stark and Howland Reed. Varys certainly knew about Cerceis and Jaimes relationship and that non of the kids was from Robert.

When Jon Arry died and Robert chose Ned as his new Hand Jon started to get dangerous. Varys mentioned not meeting many truly honourable man to Ned, so I think it to be likely that Vary was afraid of Ned. Afraid that he would reveal the true heir to the Iron Throne. Knowing that Jon became a member of the NS and knowing that Ned would certainly allow men to join the NS Varys placed jaqen h'ghar in the black cells.

But PotatoSenp4i why would Jon than still be alive?
Well after Neds death there was no real danger coming from Jon anymore. Nobody knew who his parents were so why kill him?

Anyway that would be my theory. I would be happy if you guys shared your thoughts :)",gameofthrones,True,1512832192,2017-12-09

"[TV] Fixing ""Game of Thrones"" Season 7 - Changing the Story Structure","My intention is making the finale conclusion same as the original: Dany realizes the Night's King is real, loses one of her dragons, and falls in love with Jon. The Wall is destroyed, and the army of dead marches toward the Westeros. My version of the season 7 ends same, while differing how the story reached its conclusion.

I think earlier episodes of Season 7 were great and the season peaked at the spectacular Episode 4, so differences are mainly on Episode 5-7.

- **Make it 10 episodes instead of 7.**

My fix requires 10 episodes. You will know why.

- **Jon should be questioned.**

It's a little fix but I think in Episode 1, the northern bannermen need to at least question him with *""oh, wait. Didn't you basically desert the fucking Night's Watch?""*

It's okay for them to ended up selecting Jon as the King of the North, but there must be more disagreements and conflicts surrounding it, so when Jon leaves the North, it creates more unsettling tension whether they will overthrow him or not.

Now, onto the bigger fixes.

- **Euron Greyjoy's attack on the Yara's navy**

I thought the series portrayed Euron as just Ramsay clone instead of showing his capability as a tactician and a stragedist of navy. I would like to emphasize those sides with some small changes.

Euron sends a few attack ships to Yara, attacking her Iron Fleet. Yara, due to her inexperience as a navy commander, makes a mistake by engaging them. Iron Fleet chases after the ships. However, Euron IS *experienced.* He planned and led the Lannisport attack during Greyjoy's Rebellion which was Westeros equivalent of the Pearl Harbor attack.

Yara chases the ships without knowing they were going into the deep strait with full of heavy currents which made her ships uncontrollable. It was a dark night, so Yara was unaware of the environment. And she was just on her mission of sailing to the Dorne. Euron was fully aware of geography and carefully planned the attack.

This is the real navy battle tactic exercised by Yi-Soon Shin in the Battle of Myeongnyang, luring and trapping the enemy vassals into the strait and bombarding them from far away, and Euron does exactly that (with catapults obviously instead of cannons) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTan6eDphCk

Yara and Sand Snakes abandon their burning ships and escape with the small boats, but Euron's giant galley Silence approaches and crushes their tiny boats.

On the Yara's small boats, the close combat breaks out. Now, HERE, you can show that *mad man Euron scene* (although him wearing proper armor and holding a shield would be appreciated) https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/2fa/a6/47a50180251fe35f.gif

The rest is same as the show. Most Sand Snakes are dead, Euron captures Yara alive, and Reek jumps into water.

I think is much better than just *""the battle happens and all of Iron Fleet is destroyed""* The most important thing is that the show should devote *one ENTIRE episode depicting this battle*, not just plucking it at the end of Episode 2.

As a consequence of losing Yara and Sand Snakes, both Dorne and Iron Islands cut the affiliation with Daenerys. This becomes important later.

- **Sands should not die.**

When I watched the scene where Cersei poisons Tyene, I thought it was weird and unfitting to Cersei's character that she would just 'kill' them. I mean yes, Ellaria watching her daughter dying is a bit sad but in comparison to what she did to the ""Shame"" nun, it was too clean.

In my version, they don't die. However, instead of poisoned to death, Tyene meets the same fate as the nun: *The Mountain beating and raping her in front of Ellaria's eyes.* Everyday. They are fed with small amount of food and water, involving feces and urine. This continues for months.

Sickening, yes, but that's what Cersei would actually do. Just killing the women who killed her daughter easily is not Cersei.

- **'Let's capture a wight and show it to Cersei to convince her to join us!' NO.**

Ditch that whole garbage plot. That's dumb. The most stupidest thing Game of Thrones has done, even more so than the whole goddamn Dorne plot of Season 5. Bronn should not miraculously save Jamie. 

First, Jamie would have drowned. He was fully wearing with heavy steel gears and armors. Second, Game of Thrones is about consequences. It was a huge cop out to end the cliffhanger with *""oh, Bronn saved him. Everything is fine, guys.""*

Third, even if Bronn pulled him out, how the hell Dorakis not immediately got them? Tyrion saw him, Daenerys saw him *CHARGING her full speed*, and falling into water. Even if Dany did not recognize him as Jamie, the fact that him nearly killing her alone would have enough to make her say *""hey, get that fucker.""*

My solution is the logical one: make Dorakis capture Jamie and Bronn after the Loot Train attack of Episode 4. In the beginning of Episode 5, as soon as Bronn pulling Jamie from the water, Dorakis surround them. 

Tyrion reunites his brother tied and caged. You can do that brother and brother dialogue scene without that ridiculous setting of Tyrion infiltrating the heavily fortified castle and meeting Jamie alone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLBXlix1e64

At first, Dorakis tried to execute Bronn because he is worthless, but Tyrion orders them to stop. Tyrion advises Daenerys to use him as a negotiation card against Cersei. Trading Jamie with Sands and Yara, so they can restore Targaryen-Greyjoy(Iron Islands)-Martell(Dorne) alliance again. 

In this process, Tyrion becomes important again! Acting as a diplomat, playing a political tug of war and re-bridging three factions. Tyrion and Cersei both agree to make a truce because Tyrion needs to rebuild the alliance, and Cersei needs to rebuild her army she lost in the Loot Train attack and carefully rethink her strategy with Jamie.

They exchange hostages. Jamie returned safely, but Tyene's and Ellaria's conditions are less than spectacular. Tyene lost her visions (The Mountain gauged her eyes out if want something gory), and is unable to walk again. Ellaria lost her mind, and suffers aphasia due to the extreme case of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Now, you will probably wonder, *how does Jon go to the North then?*

- **Siege of the Wall**

The Night's King's army of dead finally reaches the Wall. Tens of thousands of White Walkers surround Night's Watch, readying for the attack. 

Bran in Winterfell, sees this from the vision and informs Sansa to send a message to Jon which makes him beg Dany to go with him to the north. Dany rejects, because she doesn't believe White Walkers at this point. Jon leaves Dragonstone with Reek, Gendry and other characters. Dany ignores them at first like a true Tsundere she is, but feels guilty for not helping them.

Jon arrives Eastwatch and gathers Brotherhood Without Banners, Beric Dondarrion, Hound, Tormund for the battle. They agree to help Jon because they know if the Wall falls, the Westeros falls, so their motivation makes more sense this time.

The grand siege battle that decorates the finale of this season starts. The entire North vs White Walkers. Sansa, Arya, Bran, Jon, everyone is here. Littlefinger plays a politic game. They all play their own set roles in the battle.

I haven't fully figured out how should they attack the Wall, whether climbing up the Wall, or using the siege equipment they crafted from the wildling remains. (we already saw them using the equipment such as chains)

Benjen comes back and dies. Night's Watch is completely obliterated. They are coming over the Wall. Jon made other Starks to retreat to Winterfell, Jon stays to fight. He is about to die. At that lowest point, *DANY* comes with her three dragons to aid the North. 

Like the show, her children roasts the fuck out of Walkers. The Night's King exploits this mess as an opportunity, and throws the spear at one of the dragon like the show. I would like to fix it to The Night's King throwing the spear at Drogon who Daenerys rides on instead of Viserion, but since I don't know how that will play out in Season 8, I will leave it untouched.

She loses Viserion, and carries Jon to NOT the boat, but *Winterfell.* Here, the northerners including Starks see dragons for the first time. We see Sansa and Arya interacting with Daenerys. 

The rest is pretty much same as the show, Jon and Dany fall in love (although I don't think he should pledge his loyalty at this point), they have sex. The Night's King resurrects Viserion.

If *Littlefinger has to die* for the sake of Season 8, then make Daenerys ultimately execute him for a treason of helping Lannisters through the help of Sansa's testimony, backstabbing Littlefinger.

What language do the characters of game of thrones speak? Does GOT take place on Earth???,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1512926463,2017-12-10
[NO SPOILERS] What language do the characters of game of thrones speak? Does GOT take place on Earth??,"I understand that GOT is a fantasy world. That's not my problem. The characters (majority of them anyway) speak what we know as English. However, England does not exist in the show, books or entire ethos. So while they are speaking ""English"", to them it must be called something else right? Otherwise, if they do refer to it as English, they must recognise that England is in fact a country in the GOT universe?
Then this must mean that the GOT universe all takes place on earth? 

This is all based on the fact they call it English. If of course they give ""English"" another name, then j guess this post has been pretty pointless. 

I don't know. I have never seen them refer to the language they speak... Well I havent actively tried to notice them discussing what language they speak. 

What do you think? Can anyone answer my question??",gameofthrones,True,1512927061,2017-12-10

[EVERYTHING] White Walkers: To Be a Zombie or To Be Free?,"Hey Reddit,

I have been reading a lot about zombies in my monster studies class. I'll keep this as short as possible, but if you want to read this in depth, check out this amazing article (https://www.thing.net/~rdom/ucsd/Zombies/ZombieManifesto.pdf) 

&amp;nbsp;

To give some quick background on the zombie —&gt; The zombie comes from Haiti during the coming of global capitalism in the form of slave labor. The zombie reflects Haitians fear of becoming enslaved without agency, becoming brainless, by a master outside their control (which they rightly fear —&gt; European powers were horrific to them).

&amp;nbsp;

The article above argues that the zombie in its modern adaptation is also a monster of capitalism. First, the zombie is scary because it reveals the threat of losing our consciousness and becoming a part of the monstrous horde (89). Second, the zombie is a “stand in for our current moment, and specifically for America in a global economy, where we feed off the products of the rest of the planet, and, alienated from our humanity, stumble forward, groping for immortality as we decompose,” (93). We fear the zombie because we fear losing our sense of Self, and we especially fear the zombie because we are always at risk of becoming one (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnZGdC-vTCo to find out how much of a zombie you really are!)

&amp;nbsp;

The interesting thing to me about GoT is that is it repaints 16th and 17th century Europe, a time where kingdoms vie for power, where foreign religions threaten security, where global trade is beginning to take effect, and where a particular religion seeks to take control of a whole region (sound familiar?). It is Europe at the cusp of modernization. It is Europe at the dawn of Capitalism.

&amp;nbsp;

I like to think of Wights as the coming of this peculiar form of zombifying capitalism (think: Winter is coming ... Capitalism is coming!)  Of course, they have no economy of their own -- but the Night King seems like the capitalist and the Wights his enslaved workers. The Wights are zombies that are to be feared of ... but I wonder ... these Wights have no House, no Name, no Titles, no Kin. The Wights aren't playing the game of thrones, and they aren't dying at the hand of the game's inevitable swords and daggers. Certainly, the most horrific acts committed in GoT have been committed by humans. I wonder who is scarier: my own King …. or the Night King? Ramsey Bolton or the Dragon Wight? Who has it better: the brainless Wights or the pawns who fear death, torture, and rape in the larger chess game for the Iron Throne?

&amp;nbsp;

My question to you all: 

1. Who are you more afraid of: mankind or the Dead?

2. Would you rather be a brainless member of the Wight army? Or would you rather live in the shit-filled, gory world of Westeros as a free folk, where you can die any second as a miserable pawn in a game of kings and lords and handsome princes?

3. Do you think capitalism has a place in all this?

4. What do you think the Night King wants?

5. Do you think you are a zombie?

[EVERYTHING] Something I find awesome with Tyrion,"I just realized that he is pretty much the only major character who has a very significant and complex relationship with both Cersei and Daenerys. Two queens who are at odds for the throne. 

Some of his best scenes are when he has one on one conversations and drinks with them, and while we understand the main theme of his dynamic with each of them (where Cersei despises him and holds him responsible for anything bad that happens to her, while Daenerys respects, values and deeply cares about him to the point where she is overprotective of him), we are also given a look on how layered his relationship with each of them is.

The way I see it is that Cersei can connect with him in a way she can't with others sometimes, she has some form of respect for him where they have battle of wits and they just know each other better than anyone else. Their conversation in the S3 finale is one of my favourite Tyrion/Cersei scenes.

With Daenerys, they kind of have this marriage of two minds where they both want to make the world a better place but they sometimes have disagreements but are trying to understand each other even if they don't agree 100%. Their first meeting where they speak alone was a massive highlight of ""Hardhome"", their chemistry really met my expectations. Also their conversation in ""Beyond the Wall"" is one of the most underrated scenes of Season 7 IMO.

It really is a very interesting parallel on how he relates to both his sister by blood (Cersei) and his sister figure (Daenerys). They are all just very well written/well acted scenes, and Peter Dinklage's chemistry with both Lena Headey and Emilia Clarke is top notch.",gameofthrones,True,1512950032,2017-12-10

(EVERYTHING) What have been the most shocking scenes for you all so far?,[removed],gameofthrones,True,1512952580,2017-12-10
[EVERYTHING] What Have Been Your Most Shocking Scenes So Far?,"Game of Thrones is jam-packed with an unprecedented amount of shocking, disturbing and down right unpredictable scenes. I mean lets face it, it is part of the shows identity and we all love it! After all, all men must die right?

I am very interested in knowing what scenes have been the most shocking to you and really stood out?

Here are my 3 most shocking scenes.



3) The scarification of Shireen
During the different discussions taking place between Stannis and Melisandre about this being a possibility, I really did not think that they would have actually gone through with it. I told myself ""surely not will they portray a graphical representation of child being burned alive"". Especially when that child is extremely nice and sweet! Wrong! They did actually go through with it and i felt so bad that i then thought scenes like that should be illegal in TV!



2) The Red Wedding
So i am expecting this to crop up for a lot of you here, i mean that in a good way, or a bad way, to be honest i am not really sure how to put that one. For me this was the first true big shocker. It really did catch me out and i did not see any of it coming one bit. It all unfolded so quickly and before i knew it the episode was over. My girlfriend said to me that she didn't think she could go on watching the show and all i remember doing is needing to go out for a cigarrette, and i did. That whole part is a complete shock but what really got me was the beautiful and optimistic conversation that Rob and Talisa shared right before one of the most graphically disturbing scenes i have ever seen - the death of Talisa.



1) Sansas wedding night
If you are wondering why this one takes the prize over the most horrific set of events that is The Red Wedding, or any other scenes and situations that have upset you in a similar way. Sansas wedding night hit me a from more of an emotional and mental angle. I mean so far we had already witnessed plenty of rape during this show and despite all of being so dark, Sansa getting raped for the first time on her wedding night made me feel sick. I had survived little girls getting burnt and women being stabbed and having their throats slit but there was something about this scene that truly disgusted me. We watch her and root for her as she goes through so much shit and abuse through out the show and i think this is what had done it for me. Again, she was sweet and innocent and completely vulnerable, but always managed to survive and hold it together. Once more this tragedy caught me out right until the moment was pretty much happening. Despite them just having a wedding, my mind just wasn't travelling that far into the story or thinking about the fact that Ramsey is going to want to get his pecker wet! I honestly even thought (and was literally begging) that Theon was actually going to step in at the last minute and prevent Sansa from going through with it. It's just the way you see Ramsey bend her down and forcefully rip open her clothes and basically tells her she is going to take it right before the episode cuts and the camera focuses on pussy-boy Theon Greyjoy. It is almost as if George R R Martin is doing this on purpose!


So there you are, my 3 most shocking scenes!

[EVERYTHING] Is Arya a hypocrite?,"In season 1, Ilyn Payne earned his place on Arya's Death List because he was Ned Stark's executioner. He swung the sword that took Ned's head. Ilyn Payne, though he only did this upon being ordered by *KING* Joffrey. So, Ilyn Payne is on a death list for simply being the poor shlub commanded to do a job.

On the other hand.... in season 7, Arya killed Littlefinger during his ""trial"" for treason and murder. Sansa, the Lady of Winterfell, passed sentence for him to be killed. Arya cut his throat. Afterward, Sansa and Arya stand on the walls of the castle to discuss Baelish's execution. Sansa says to Arya, ""*You* did it."" Arya replies, ""I was just the executioner. *YOU* passed the sentence.""

Arya separated herself as the instrument of the will of ruling lord. She takes no responsibilty for killing Littlefinger. No different than Ilyn Payne doing the same thing to Ned Stark after being commanded by the king. But, as far as we know Ilyn Payne is still on her kill list. Arya seems to be acting a bit hypocritically.

**EDIT:** If Arya encounters Ilyn Payne in season 8, would she release him from her Death List? Does she now understand that Ilyn Payne played no reasonably controllable role in the death of her father?",gameofthrones,True,1512974543,2017-12-11

I was reading someone comment about this moment on this sub and now that I think about it, it really was one of the few happy moments we had ever seen between characters in a while. Plus it really showed us Tyrion's true side, all he wants behind serious matters is to enjoy life with people he would consider genuine friends and craves love from a family that sees him as a person who matters rather than a disgrace. Which fits perfectly with Daenerys cause what she really wants in life is a family. It was nice while it lasted until the Masters arrived to reclaim Meereen.

The cook is then turned into a rat that can never cure its hunger and kills everyone it’s ever cared about.

One of said questions was if Matt Damon was on Game of Thrones and he answered no, saying that he was into Game of Thrones, but not on it. But I remember way back to the series opening Matt Damon being there. He and the two men he is with are killed by White Walkers.
I've always thought that was Matt Damon, but it evidently wasn't. So, who was that guy.

2. Tyrion and Varys' reactions to seeing the wight - I cant imagine that they didn't examine it before they arrived at Kingslanding.

A while ago I posted a shirt that I made to wear to a finale party and it blew up! https://instagram.com/p/BYURObeDOiQ/ here's a link to that shirt. You all loved it and asked for them and I couldn't believe it. 

Since that happened I bought my own supplies and started a small side business and just got my first large order from a bike shop near me!

So right now Ive been trying to make more content and thought it would be cool to have pictures of my designs being worn. My idea is if you guys wanna send me pics with your shirts on I'll post them and can tag you and I'll send you a promo code for 50% off anything in my shop. (Don't use it today though bc everything is already half off for small business Saturday)

And again thank you all so much!",gameofthrones,True,1511623911,2017-11-25

[Everything] How does the naming system for bastards work beyond the first generation?,"Apologies if this has been discussed before. 

As we know, bastards in various parts of Westeros are given last names that are a characteristic of the area they were born in. Snow for the North, Sand for Dorne, Stone for the Eyrie etc. So if you met someone of that name in Westeros, the assumption is that they are a bastard. 

However, what happens when a bastard with their special name grows up and has kids of their own? Their kids would also have their bastard last name, even though they aren't bastards. So after the first generation, how do you tell a bastard from a legitimate child, grandchild or other descendant of a bastard? And if there isn't a way to do this, what's the point of giving bastards characteristic names?

[MAIN SPOILERS] How would you have handled the Faith Militant?,"Rewatching the show and thinking through the whole situation with Tommen, Cersei, Tyrells and the Faith Militant. Tommen was incredibly inefficient at handling the situation which got me thinking about how I would handle the situation. I really don't have any good ideas apart from what Jaime and Olenna tried - approach with an army and risk civil war. So I'm turning the same question over to Reddit.

You're Tommen Baratheon and your queen, your brother-in-law, and mother are now being held prisoner by the Faith Militant. You are not allowed to see them. The Faith also has a strong following among the population of KL. How would you get your family back, safe and unharmed? ",gameofthrones,True,1511727184,2017-11-26
"[EVERYTHING] Wholes and Halves, a tiny tinfoil theory.","So I don't know if this has been posted before, probably. But back in season four, Tywin had Ice, the famed Stark Valyrian Steel greatsword, reforged into two swords, Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail. Oathkeeper went to Brienne, and Widow's Wail went initially to Joffrey, then to Jaime, after Joffrey was poisoned by his enemies. So now that Jaime is riding North , and now that Brienne is North as well, those halves will be reunited. Ice will, in a way, be back in Winterfell. And maybe, just maybe, will be made whole again. It's not like they're lacking in the talented smith department...  Anyways, I just had a quick thought, and it's probably been brought up anyways, considering this show gets dissected heavily come off-season.

"[MAIN SPOILERS] This will get some flak, but I’ll say it anyway....","I was rewatching season 1, and I saw a scene where Khal Drogo tells Dany that the Dothraki’s reward for their fighting is pillaging, raping women, etc.

Then, of course, we see how Dany puts an end to that later in the series.

So, were expected to believe that thousands upon thousands of Dothraki soldiers, men, warriors, are submitting to the most beautiful woman in the world- I know she has dragons and that she burned them alive in their holy place- but were expected to now believe that these Dothraki men fight with such passion.....and then are not even allowed to release this passion in the form of raping women or having slave women? Right.

Listen, I’m not here to talk about the ethics of this situation. Don’t flame me about that. I’m talking real world. George Martin would NEVER have something like this happen in his books, or at least I don’t think he would. As a matter of fact, maybe he plans to. But it just seems so freaking fake. It’s a show about magic, so yeah, but add SOME realism to it. Please.

In the words of Jorah Mormont, “all it takes is one arrow through your heart, your grace, and it’s all over.”

Dany is not invincible. You don’t let men like the Dothraki release their testosterone, it turns into anger. It’s just such a hard to believe scenario.

[EVERYTHING] How old is Tyrion suppose to be?,"To my understanding, he is the youngest out of his siblings next to Cersei and Jaime who are twins. I'm not sure if the book or shows ever point out the age difference, but just curious if anyone here has a bit of a guess. Based on the scene Tyrion had with Oberyn in Season 4 as he was telling him about how he met him before when he was just born, I would assume Cersei and Jaime were pre-teens to teenagers around that time. I'm also guessing he wasn't even born yet around the timeline we see a flashback featuring a younger Cersei in the opening scene to the Season 5 premiere episode.

I'm just really interested to know because Peter Dinklage is older than both Lena Headey (Cersei) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) IRL.",gameofthrones,True,1511735320,2017-11-26
[EVERYTHING] What if this were to happen in Season 8?,"I have a feeling that Cersei and the Golden Company will end up having to fight against the Army of the Dead in Season 8. Now just hear me out on this. We already know Cersei is planning to betray her alliance with Jon, Dany, Tyrion and co. by using the Golden Company to wipe out what remains of them after the Great War has ended. But what if it all backfires, when the Army of the Dead comes at her by surprise.

I think that the first battle will take place at Winterfell, and after the death of a number of characters, the major characters that are left along with little forces they have will have no choice but to abandon it, retreat and come up with something else on what to do next. Right before the GC can take action, they are ambushed by the dead in King's Landing. This would have everyone fighting in the same place once the major characters arrive to try and protect the city once they've figured something out and learn that they are heading South. This could probably trigger Cersei to blow up the city with the rest of the wildfire that is left underneath the Capital.

Just a theory. What do you think?",gameofthrones,True,1511735747,2017-11-26
[EVERYTHING] My prediction for the starks,"Now this is a prediction I have and that is that by the end I think there will be one more stark alive by the end. Personally I think the last one will be Arya Stark. Why? Well for a few reasons. For one it would be probably a very shocking twist sense not a lot of people think Arya could live to the end but I think she will. Another thing is that Arya has always been considered a survivor. Finally I think it would be very tragic if she lost her two last siblings and became the last of her kind.

Now what about Sansa and Bran. Well if magic will be gone by the end then that means Bran may die and Sansa lost Lady and if the Direwolf dies then that means the Stark with it could die. Now Bran I think will either die trying to warg into the Ice Dragon or will get killed by the NK at the tree in WF paralleling the Three eyed Raven's death. As for Sansa I think she will either die at WF too or she will be captured by Cersei and get executed. By the end Arya will be the last of her kind (besides Jon but he is technically a Targ) but I think she will marry Gendry and they will continue the Stark/Baratheon line.

Also Arya cans till go on adventure and not be a lady. Perhaps Gendry could just go with her.",gameofthrones,True,1511740541,2017-11-26

[EVERYTHING] Theory going all the way back to he mad king.,"This theory is based on three things we know to be true from throughout watching the television series:

1. Bran can influence the past as seen in him making past Ned Stark hear a voice and turn around, and obviously with Hodor.

2. The Mad King was said to have voices in his head (kinda like how bran spoke to young Ned Stark), and they were often telling him to burn things. He was famously quoted as he died saying over and over ""Burn them all"" (which brings to mind another character in this show is famous for repeating a phrase incessantly).

3. The most effective way to kill the army of the dead is burning them. Ideally burning them all. 

Now you probably see where I'm going with this but to clarify I think Bran pulled a Hodor situation again but with much bigger consequences this time and ended up making the Mad King mad. It's admittedly a bit of a stretch as to why Bran would do this, but I think it probably has something to do with Bran trying to use his powers to burn the white walkers and messing with Aegon's head.

TLDR: Bran possibly made the mad king mad.",gameofthrones,True,1511746410,2017-11-26

Forgive Me

Rains of Castamere

Dance of Dragons


Also my personal observation but I feel that Ramin Djawadi must be a secret Targaryen fan because even though officially there is just one surviving member of that family, Daenerys, she got all the cool music along with the dragons or because of the dragons ? :-)

[Main Spoilers] Edmure Tully,"Sorry if this has been discussed at length before (or is super obvious), but I need like-minded people to talk with about this since any time I bring up the name Edmure Tully with my friends, they roll their eyes and tell me to move on.

But, I can't help but think that Edmure might very well be one of the most important characters from a political/military strategy standpoint going into S8. With Jaime Lannister potentially headed up North to warn Dany and Jon about Cersei's betrayal of the truce, the smart thing to do would be to shore up the defenses against the Lannister army. Geographically, this means the Twins.

I might be wrong, but with Hoster dead and the Frays nearly having been made extinct, Edmure Tully would be Lord of the Riverlands if not for the current Fray family survivors (obviously Lannister puppets at this point). In fact, he may very well be twice-entitled of the title: once by birth as a Tully and once by marriage to the Frays. My thought is that Jaime would not have too hard a time reinstalling Edmure to his rightful place (the Frays may not know about Jaime's leaving his sister per her pride, and thus listen to him). The truth is that with the North/Targaryen forces focused on the White Walker incursion, there needs to be a defensive focus to the south that they cannot properly address by opening a second front - my guess is that Edmure will be the rightful one to lead this defense.

Of course this all kind of depends on where Edmure has been kept under house arrest. If he was left in Riverrun or the Twins this is the best case scenario for this concept since it's a straighter shot for Jaime from King's Landing to Winterfell. If he was in Casterly Rock, he's either dead, has been moved to Highgarden, or is already in Targaryen custody (though if this is the case Jon and Sansa would pretty easily demand his re-appointment as Lord of the Riverlands pending Jaime's confirmation of events in KL/assistance in his installation).

I know that political and military strategy matters in the story have been simplified in the past few seasons of the show, especially in S7. My fear is that the show-runners, given tight constraints re: episode count in S8, are basically going to eliminate a seven-season buildup to the respective showdowns with the White Walkers and the Lannisters, with the liberal application ""Dragon-ex-machina"". I would prefer a more detailed and nuanced approach, which is why I think Edmure could end up being incredibly important.

TL/DR: Edmure should be Lord of the Riverlands, and would provide a much-needed southern defensive front for the North. Jaime could help make this happen. This would be so much more satisfying than ""Dragons win everything"".",gameofthrones,True,1511826378,2017-11-27
[Everything] Tyrion's Betrayal,"Looking back on this last season and thinking of over a lot, I've come to the conclusion that Tyrion betrayed Dany.

Not in the way you are probably thinking though.

He betrayed her out of love, love for his brother.

You couldn't go anywhere during season7 without hearing people point out how stupid it was to get a wight to convince Cersei, which it was.

If Tyrion's plan was to convince her, I don't believe that. I feel the wight heist was a plan to get Jamie out of the line of Dracarys.

He knew that Jamie would choose to defend the realm over serving Cersei if he knew the danger to the realm was real

Some clues: 
Tyrion knows his sister and brother more than anyone.

He knows how each would react to seeing the zombie.

He had recently seen what Dany does to enemies that 
refuse to bow and it really shook him up.

He saw Jamie miss death by inches when he charges Dany.

He was desperate to keep Dany from risking herself to aid Jon, because he knows the plan to capture a wight was not serving Dany's interest, it was serving his.

He really doesn't have a problem with using fire to kill his enemies, (Blackwater) 

During the meeting everyone was looking at either the dead man or looking for Cersei's reaction. Except Tyrion, he was looking at Jamie too.

It might explain his poor tactics, he was trying to win the war in a way that didn't result in Jamie's death and it backfired on him.

Also, his plan worked, Jamie finally left Cersei. Though it came at the cost of one of his queen's dragons and the fall of the Wall.",gameofthrones,True,1511827546,2017-11-27

[TV] Alternative Battle of the Goldroad,"First of all, I know this has been discussed before and it's been floating around the internet for a while, but I want to hear YOUR opinions on the issue.

During Daenerys's attack on the Lannister troops when they're taking the gold to King's Landing, wouldn't it had been better if Drogon had actually killed Bronn? Him jumping to safety in 1 second like 4 feet away from the crossbow seemed ridiculous. How the hell did Drogon miss him? Also, killing Bronn would give the battle much more significance and weight.

Then, when Jaime charges on his horse to kill Dany, wouldn't it had been better if Drogon had used its tail to whip Jaime and the horse 60 feet away, leaving Jaime heavily injured and unconscious, perfectly set to be captured? We would have gotten an interrogation scene between King Aeris's killer and his daughter, and Tyrion's stretched ""sneak into King's Landing to tell Jaime about a truce"" plan wouldn't have been necessary.

Bronn surviving thanks to a 4 feet jump was stupid. Jaime being carried a whole mile through a river in armor was stupid. What are your thoughts on this?",gameofthrones,True,1511863220,2017-11-28

[EVERYTHING] S8 Jon Snow theory (with a GRRM quote and everything)...,"After watching the great video ""Alt Shift X: Was Rhaegar the true hero of Game of Thrones?"" that was posted up here - which has a brief discussion on whether Jon Snow is actually Lightbringer himself (not a theory I'm going to touch upon here) - it got me thinking about how the show represents magic, and what this might mean for the story in S8.

The show, while having a few fantasy elements, seems to ground itself in realism - with courtly intrigues and personal stories taking top priority, as well as showing gritty and unglamorous violence. Its approach to magic seems much the same, introducing only a few magical elements throughout the entire series and keeping them low key enough so that they don't interfere with the drama (compared to a series where magic is rife and so more or less anything can happen, undermining the dramatic stakes).

GoT has also taken pains to make its magic precedented, as moments where magic proves to be pivotal in the later seasons have already been demonstrated earlier in the show. For example, Dondarrion has been resurrected by R'hllor many times before Jon Snow is, so it doesn't feel as much like Deus Ex Machina. Likewise we've seen undead animals before Viserion is made into a White Walker, so this too doesn't feel terribly out of place.

Therefore given the show doesn't like to drop in new Deus Ex Machina style magic at pivotal moments, I was trying to think of how existing magic in the show could be worked into remaining unresolved storylines, especially combatting the Night King. I came up with...

What if Jon Snow dies, gets made into a wight or White Walker, and then someone also tries to resurrect him by way of R'hllor too? This might overturn the Children of the Forest's magic, and or otherwise give him some sort of power to defeat the Night King. It also requires little to no exposition (which is good given the episodes will be tight for time if there's only 6 of them), as we've seen people become a White Walker in the show, and we've seen people being resurrected - putting those two elements together doesn't take any sort of leap for the audience.

Lastly, getting onto the GRRM quote, he said in an interview with Time magazine concerning R'hllor's resurrection, ""[...] poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this, every time he’s a little less Beric. His memories are fading, he’s got all these scars, he’s becoming more and more physically hideous, because he’s not a living human being anymore. His heart isn’t beating, his blood isn’t flowing in his veins, he’s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we’re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing."" Making someone simultaneously an ice wight and a fire wight seems very much an embodiment of, ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.""

To me it matches the overall arc of Jon being the reluctant and self-sacrificing hero, and seems like a natural fit to the Azor Ahai prophecy. It's also one of those things that while it would be surprising doesn't feel unprecedented, because all those magical effects have been in the series already - they just haven't been combined in that way. In that regard the audience wouldn't feel cheated or that something had been plucked from thin air.

I'm not sure where this leaves Daenerys, maybe she makes Lightbringer by killing Viserion with something Valyrian Steel, if the old Lightbringer was made by Azor Ahai killing his wife - who knows!

EDIT: Replaced some mentions of wight with White Walker. Really either would fit this scenario, I think (if he was a straight white being resurrected could mess with the link back to a White Walker, if he was a White Walker maybe resurrection would ""cure"" him in some way. Imagine if the blueness that we saw spreading when the Night King was first made replaced in the same way with a human appearance if he was resurrected by R'hllor).

What do you think to Jon Snow being White Walkered (or wighted) and revived again? What's your own personal theory about how the battle with the Night King might wrap?",gameofthrones,True,1511869150,2017-11-28

[EVERYTHING] Have we already seen the secret GRRM told...,"Okay so in April 2016, Liam Cunningham (the actor who plays Davos) appeared on Conan O'Brien and told a story about how the first time he met George R. R. Martin, he leaned in and said ""I'm gonna tell you a secret, but you can't tell anybody.""  You can view the clip here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Toam5br4lBE

It's certainly possible that the ""secret"" is something we've already seen, like Shireen burning (although that already happened when this show aired) or Davos helping resurrect Jon Snow.  But I haven't ever seen any follow-up confirmation from Cunningham either way.  Does that mean that the secret is still out there?

And if so, what do you think it is?  Personally, I'm inclined to think that Davos's role in the end of things may be far bigger than we might expect otherwise.",gameofthrones,True,1511873504,2017-11-28

For me I think the NK and the others will be defeated mid way through the series with Jorah as Azor ahai and him forced to kill Dany in order to forge Lightbringer. Cersei and Euron are the final bads with Cersei killing Jaime and capturing and killing Sansa.

Arya kills Cersei,  Jon and theon defeat Euron, all the dragons die, and Brienne dies giving birth to Jaime's child with Jon taking care of the child as Sansa would've wanted. Jon would be crowned king of the seven kingdoms not because he wants it but because it would be his duty. ",gameofthrones,True,1511879011,2017-11-28

[MAIN SPOILERS] Valyrian Steel Swords Theory,"First Time posting in this Sub


---


Hey, 



I've been bingehearing In Deep Geek, GrayArea, The Last Harpy, TalkingThrones and some others (about 4 or 5 I missed) since last Saturday and I feel I have a pretty good idea on what is gonna happen with the 4 Valyrian Blades in the show and a take on Gendry and his role in this. This will fit in with quite some theories



1st of all, Gendry is working with Valyrian steel, only not with the 5 Valyrian Blades called Catspaw Dagger, Widowswail, Heartsbane, Longclaw and Oathkeeper. At least not before the war is over. 



The Catspaw dagger has seen it's purpose. It is entirely possible Arya is gonna use it once more to defend herself to kill a White Walker, but the Catspaw opened in the series with a blade owned by Littlefinger, and it has killed Littlefinger. So it will probably not have a major role anymore.



Oathkeeper from Briënne will not be reforged into Ice, because Briënne still has an Oath to keep. She will probably use it to save Sansa at some point, as Arya has her own fightingskills.



Widowswail will still be in Jaime's possession until he fillfills his prophecy and complete his redemption arc. Cersei will have a miscarriage, adding to Maggy the Frog's prediction of her only having 3 children. This will send her to become the Mad Queen, as she will have lost everything. In episode 6 she will decide to use Wildfire to ""Burn them all"", recalling back to the Mad King, after the Night King is defeated where the Golden Company has switched sides to fight, She will say this after they are under attack. Here Jaime and the Hound step in, first killing Qyburn (the pyromancer, done by Jaime) The Hound killing the mountain with firerelated stuff, and Jaime fullfilling the Valonqar prophecy with Widowswail, as Cersei is the widow who wails.



Heartsbane of Sam is the one im least sure over, but I think it will be the new Lightbringer, pierced through someone's heart. I feel this is gonna be the hearth of Bran Stark, as he is the Nightking with the Dragonglass in his hearth, and that this happens on the Isle of Faces, whilst Bran holds his band against the Weirwood Trees who are there



Longclaw will be used in the final battle by Jon and will be part of a huge battle earlier in the season against the Nightking at Winterfell, where it will shatter. He will than get Heartsbane to do his final trick.



Back to Gendry. He is gonna make Valyrian Steel. Thanks to the books Sam has stolen, he has besides his weapon also the last major reveal by him, which how Valyrian Steel was made, which will be Dragonglass and Dragonfire. Gendry will possibly make a bunch of Valyrian steel blades for the some Maincharacters.

I just feel like she's been through too much BS with too little happiness - bouncing from Renley to Joffrey then getting like 2 seconds with Tommen before being arrested and having to go through all that.

If she was still alive, it would stand to reason that Tommen would also still be alive.  This of course means that Dany and her army would be coming for Tommen's throne, not Cersei's.

[Everything] Cersei's Character Arc and the Valonqar,"I have been thinking of the ways that GRRM could finish Cersei's arc in the most Game of Thrones way possible. He's a big fan of killing characters that dothe right thing. With all the similarities between the Mad King and Cersei I think she is going to burn everyone in King's Landing and get killed for it. Now that seems pretty expected since everyone thinks Cersei is a villain. However, I think she will set off the wildfire caches throughout the city to defend the realm from the Whitewalkers and specifically the Night King. 

I think she will be outside the city walls with Jaime when the explosion happens. The army of the dead will be inside King's Landing and she will take most of them out along with a Whitewalker or two. Jaime will not realize the bigger picture of the sacrifice and will choke her out to fulfill Maggy the Frog's prophecy.  We will know that Cersei has redeemed herself and Jaime will feel tremendous guilt over murdering his sister and take his own life. 

I think this would be a great way to wrap up Cersei's arc as well as fulfilling Maggy's prophecy. This would also fulfill the prophecy (well kinda) of Cersei and Jaime coming into the world together and leaving it together. ",gameofthrones,True,1511888984,2017-11-28

She lost her horse, she lost her brother, she lost her husband, she lost her boy, she lost her army and she lost her dignity. The wine was not poisoned, the wineseller had his own reasons. He just escaped because he was late for his work. It was just a coincidence. They didn't even drink the wine to see if it's poisoned or not, they just killed him with no judgement. That man was completely innocent and just wanted to make his beloved Khaleesi drink a good wine. The Wineseller just cursed Daenerys Targaryen, Khal Drogo, and the dothraki army. Also, we didn't see a death scene of The Wineseller. So we don't know if it's dead or not.

What do you think? I think we'll see him at the Season 8.",gameofthrones,True,1511979990,2017-11-29

[EVERYTHING] The Dark Side of Warging...,"What if the Night King's control over the dead is just another type of Warging, but is considered taboo? Perhaps the reason why the Children of the Forest turned the humans into White Walkers: so they didn't have to dirty their own hands using such dark practices.

Also, Bran has shown us through Hodor that it's possible to warg into other people - I think they just have to have an inferior mind. The Night King is immortal and the humans are dead, so they shouldn't be too hard to control once you figure out how.

Additionally, this would explain how the wight in Season 1 knew to look for Lord Commander Mormont - the Night King could have been seeing through the Wight's eyes similar to how Bran saw through Hodor's or Summer's. Wights don't seem to have any substantial intelligence of their own, so there's no way one would be smart enough to understand the importance of the Lord Commander and actively look for him unless he was being directly controlled.

Finally, the eyes - when normal Wargs do their thing, the eyes turn white. But what if this particular form of Warging turns the eyes blue?

It's clear that the Night King does have some sort of Warging ability, as shown by how he interacts with Bran, but the question here is whether or not his necromancer powers are just another form of Warging or their own separate thing.

I'm tinfoil hatting at this point, but what if the series will end with Bran tapping into the 'dark side' of Warging and wrestling control over a portion of the Army of the Dead, in order to make them fight each other? This could distract them so Jon and crew can reach the White Walkers. Or maybe the Three Eyed Raven's destiny is to become the new Night King (not the past Night King/NK we have now, but a completely new one) in order to assume control of the White Walkers after the Night King's death and send them back north.

TL;DR: The Night King's control over the Army of the Dead might just be an advanced and taboo form of Warging, which Bran's own Warging powers could be compatible with.",gameofthrones,True,1512016990,2017-11-29
[Main Spoilers] Could Greyscale be used against the you know whats?,"Just a random thought that popped into my head when considering what courses of action could be taken against the white walkers. I have thought of two possible ways that greyscale could be used to human advantage. The first would be to sacrifice someone infected with the disease by having them infect a white walker. The aim of this would be to see if the infection could be spread between all of the white walkers and eventually lead to their demise. The other would be send stonemen to fight the white walkers. However, the second possibility could potentially backfire. ",gameofthrones,True,1512020086,2017-11-30

[Everything] Stannis’ Legacy,"Stannis may be gone, but I feel like a part of him lives on in Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen). Great and powerful men have been an influence on Jon: Ned Stark, Benjen Stark, Maester Aemon, Mance Rayder, Lord Commander Mormont, Stannis Baratheon, etc. While Jon has a natural sense of duty, I think Stannis’ sense of duty and conviction rubbed off on Jon, making his stronger in the process. In season 5, Stannis frequently kept observing Jon and asked him to join him, offering to officially make him Lord Jon Stark of Winterfell. Davos informed Jon that Stannis saw something in him. Melisandre affirmed the observation. Even Shireen noticed it, feeling like a disappointment when she saw how her father looked proudly at Jon (glad Stannis assured her he loved her). I got the vibe that Stannis viewed Jon as the son he wished he had. Stannis noticed almost immediately that Jon was special. I’d like to think that his stay at Castle Black had some influence on Jon and a little bit of his legacy will live on in Jon, especially with Davos as his right hand man after Stannis fell. What do you guys think? Did the books also portray the same relationship between Jon and Stannis. Would like to read your opinions.",gameofthrones,True,1512042968,2017-11-30
